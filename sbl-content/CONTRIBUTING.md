This repository is used as a way to support content publication on consumerfinance.gov.
It is generally not intended as a space for collaboration.
If you find issues with the SBL content in this repo, please contact [SBL Help](/README.md#getting-help).

If you wish to contribute to another part of this repo besides SBL content,
there are two main ways to do so:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest process updates and report bugs.

## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have associated
unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.
