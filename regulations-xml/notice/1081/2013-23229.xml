      <title>Section 1081.203 Scheduling Conference</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section requires the parties to meet before the initial scheduling conference to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, and other matters to be determined at the scheduling conference.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Within 20 days of the service of the notice of charges, or at another time if the parties agree, the hearing officer and the parties are to have a scheduling conference. This section sets forth the issues to be discussed at the scheduling conference. These issues are drawn from those the parties are required to discuss at scheduling and prehearing conferences under the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.31, the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221, and the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21. Paragraph (b)(1) provides that the parties shall be prepared to address the determination of hearing dates and location, and whether, in proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act, the hearing should commence later than 60 days after service of the notice of charges. This provision was added to account for the requirement in section 1053(b) of the Act that the hearing be held no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice of charges, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Bureau at the request of any party so served. It is expected that the parties shall discuss a hearing date at the scheduling conference, and that this would afford respondents the opportunity to request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>It is also expected that at or before the scheduling conference, the parties will discuss any issues related to the production of documents pursuant to § 206, any anticipated motions for witness statements pursuant to § 207, whether either party intends to issue documentary subpoenas, and whether either party believes that depositions will be necessary to preserve the testimony of witnesses who will be unavailable for the hearing. The parties are also expected to discuss the need and a schedule for any expert discovery.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The hearing officer is required to issue a scheduling order at or within five days of the conclusion of the scheduling hearing, setting forth the date and location of the hearing, as well as other procedural determinations made. It is expected that the hearing officer will establish any dates for expert discovery in the scheduling order, or else expressly find that such discovery is not necessary or reasonable in a particular case. This scheduling order will govern the course of the proceedings, unless later modified by the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Provision for a prompt scheduling conference followed by prompt issuance of a scheduling order is necessary in order to allow for the orderly course of proceedings on the timeline set forth elsewhere in the Rules. Particularly in cases brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Act in which the respondent does not request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the statute, it is essential that the hearing officer and the parties have a clear understanding of the applicable schedule at the earliest possible date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As provided for in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221(f), this section provides that any person named as a respondent in a notice of charges who fails to appear at a scheduling conference may be deemed in default pursuant to § 201(d)(1). Finally, like the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21(g), this section provides that scheduling conferences are presumptively public unless the hearing officer determines otherwise based on the standard set forth in § 119.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.203 Scheduling Conference</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1081.203 of the Interim Final Rule sets forth the requirements related to scheduling conferences. Paragraph (a) of this section requires the parties to meet before the initial scheduling conference to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, and other matters to be determined at the scheduling conference.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) of § 1081.203 of the Interim Final Rule provides that within 20 days of the service of the notice of charges, or at another time if the parties agree, the hearing officer and the parties are to have a scheduling conference. The Bureau revised paragraph (b) to clarify that a scheduling conference is to be held, not just scheduled, within 20 days of service of the notice of charges. This clarification is intended to reflect the Bureau's original intent with respect to the timing of the scheduling conference.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) of this section also sets forth the issues to be discussed at the scheduling conference. These issues are drawn from those the parties are required to discuss at scheduling and prehearing conferences under the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.31, the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221, and the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21. Paragraph (b)(1) provides that the parties shall be prepared to address the determination of hearing dates and location, and whether, in proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the hearing should commence later than 60 days after service of the notice of charges. This provision is intended to account for the requirement in section 1053(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act that the hearing be held no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice of charges, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Bureau at the request of any party so served. It is expected that the parties will discuss a hearing date at the scheduling conference, and that this would afford respondents the opportunity to request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe.</analysisParagraph>

The parties are also expected to discuss the need and a schedule for any expert discovery.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (d) of § 1081.203, the hearing officer is required to issue a scheduling order at or within five days of the conclusion of the scheduling hearing, setting forth the date and location of the hearing, as well as other procedural determinations made. It is expected that the hearing officer will establish any dates for expert discovery in the scheduling order, or else expressly find that such discovery is not necessary or reasonable in a particular case. This scheduling order will govern the course of the proceedings, unless later modified by the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As provided for in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221(f), paragraph (e) of this section provides that any person named as a respondent in a notice of charges who fails to appear at a scheduling conference may be deemed in default pursuant to § 1081.201(d)(1). Finally, like the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21(g), this section provides that scheduling conferences are presumptively public unless the hearing officer determines otherwise based on the standard set forth in § 1081.119(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comment on § 1081.203 of the Interim Final Rule and adopts it with the single clarification discussed above in the Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.202 Amended Pleadings</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section provides that the parties may amend the notice of charges or the answer at any stage of the proceeding. Formal amendments to the notice of charges and answer are not required when an issue not raised by the notice of charges or answer is tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties. In the event that a party seeks to introduce evidence at a hearing that is outside the scope of matters raised in the notice of charges or answer, the hearing officer may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action unless the objecting party demonstrates that admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The Bureau has adopted this liberal standard to the amendment of the pleadings to promote adjudication on the merits, and believes that the standard set forth in the rule should adequately protect parties from undue prejudice.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.202 Amended Pleadings</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule provides that a notice of charges or an answer may be amended or supplemented as a matter of course at any stage of the proceeding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on § 1081.202, but the Bureau has amended paragraph (a) of this section on its own initiative to require a party who wishes to amend a pleading to obtain the consent of the other party or leave of the hearing officer. By requiring written consent or leave of the hearing officer to amend pleadings, the revised section encourages parties to plead their case fully, as opposed to reserving claims and defenses for last minute amendments. This section continues to reflect a liberal standard of permitting amendments of pleadings, but implements an appropriate limit for amendments that are unduly prejudicial.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts paragraph (b) of § 1081.202 of the Interim Final Rule without change. As a result, when a party seeks to introduce evidence at a hearing that is outside the scope of matters raised in the notice of charges or answer, the hearing officer may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action unless the objecting party demonstrates that admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.201 Answer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section requires a respondent to file an answer in all cases. The Bureau considered, but rejected, the approach set forth in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.220(a), whereby an answer is required only if specified in the notice of charges. The Bureau believes that an answer can help focus and narrow the matters at issue. Respondents must file an answer within 14 days of service of the notice of charges. The 14-day time period is adopted from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.12. As in the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.19(c), failure to file a timely answer is deemed to be a waiver of the right to appear and a consent to the entry of an order granting the relief sought by the Bureau in the notice of charges. This section provides that in the case of default, the hearing officer is authorized, without further proceedings, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of charges and to enter a recommended decision containing appropriate findings and conclusions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section adopts the procedure from the SEC Rules for a motion to set aside a default, 17 CFR 201.155. It also provides that the hearing officer, prior to the filing of the recommended decision, or the Director, at any time, may set aside a default for good cause shown.

      <title>Section 1081.201 Answer and Disclosure Statement and Notification of Financial Interest</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule requires a respondent to file an answer in all cases. The Bureau considered, but rejected, the approach set forth in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.220(a), whereby an answer is required only if specified in the notice of charges. The Bureau believes that an answer can help focus and narrow the matters at issue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, respondents must file an answer within 14 days of service of the notice of charges. The 14-day time period is adopted from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.12. Two commenters requested that paragraph (a) of this section be amended to provide 20 days from service of the notice of charges, rather than 14 days, to file an answer. One commenter stated that it takes a considerable amount of time to review the notice of charges, investigate the factual and legal allegations, determine the appropriate response, and draft an answer. That commenter also stated that more than 14 days will be necessary to prepare an answer because the Bureau is not required to provide affirmative disclosures pursuant to § 1081.206(d) until seven days after service of the notice of charges. Both commenters note that the Federal banking agencies and the SEC allow 20 days to file an answer. Finally, one commentator stated that the 14-day requirement may cause respondents to answer with repeated assertions that they lack information, leading to fewer stipulations, and undercutting the Bureau's goal of timely adjudications.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to amend the Interim Final Rule as requested. The statutory requirement that a hearing be held between 30 to 60 days after the service of the notice of charges, unless an earlier date is set at the request of any party so served, necessitates a compressed timeline for litigating adjudication proceedings. The Bureau is not alone in setting a 14-day deadline for an answer. As noted above, the FTC requires respondents in administrative proceedings to file an answer within 14 days of service of the complaint.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Further, as noted above, the Bureau has adopted a policy pursuant to which it will generally provide advance notice of a possible enforcement action to prospective respondents before filing a notice of charges. Recipients of such notices will have an opportunity to submit a response in writing. As a result, many respondents will have considered and responded to most or all of the Bureau's allegations before receiving the notice of charges. The advance notice will also give respondents a prior opportunity to identify facts to which they may stipulate, addressing the expressed concern that a 14-day deadline to answer may lead to fewer factual stipulations.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau is not persuaded that respondents need additional time to answer after receiving the Bureau's affirmative disclosure documents. In typical civil litigation, and in administrative proceedings before the prudential regulators and the FTC, respondents file an answer before conducting any discovery. The Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation will be triggered before a respondent's answer is due. Thus, respondents will have access to more information prior to filing an answer than is available to most respondents in other civil and administrative proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, pursuant to § 1081.115, a respondent may ask for an extension of time to file an answer. While such extensions are strongly disfavored, they may be granted if the respondent makes a strong showing that the denial of its motion for an extension of time would substantially prejudice its case. For all of these reasons, the Bureau declines to amend the deadline for filing an answer contained in paragraph (a) of § 1081.201 of the Interim Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As in the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.19(c), paragraph (d) of this section provides that failure to file a timely answer is deemed to be a waiver of the right to appear and a consent to the entry of an order granting the relief sought by the Bureau in the notice of charges. This section provides that in the case of default, the hearing officer is authorized, without further proceedings, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of charges and to enter a recommended decision containing appropriate findings and conclusions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (d)(2) of this section adopts the procedure from the SEC Rules for a motion to set aside a default, 17 CFR 201.155. It also provides that the hearing officer, prior to the filing of the recommended decision, or the Director, at any time, may set aside a default for good cause shown.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the discussion of § 1081.105 above, the Bureau noted the addition of a new § 1081.201(e) requiring the filing of a disclosure statement and notification of financial interest. Consistent with the Bureau's goal of an expeditious, fair, and impartial hearing process, the Bureau seeks to provide the parties and the hearing officer with information to identify potential or actual bases for disqualification early in the process. Section 1081.201(e) is modeled on the disclosure statements required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26.1, Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 26.1.1, and Sixth Circuit Rule 26.1. This disclosure is calculated to reach a majority of the circumstances that are likely to call for disqualification on the basis of financial information that a hearing officer may not know or recollect; however, the disclosure does not cover all of the circumstances that may call for disqualification. In addition to requiring a respondent, a nongovernmental amicus, or a nongovernmental intervenor to identify any parent corporation or any publicly owned corporation owning 10% or more of its stock, § 1081.201(e) also requires the identification of “any publicly owned corporation not a party to the proceeding that has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding and the nature of that interest.” The types of financial interests that must be disclosed under this section include, for example, insurance, franchise, or indemnity agreements giving a publicly owned corporation a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> Sixth Circuit Rule 26.1(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section, similar to the comparable Uniform Rule, 12 CFR 19.18, contains the requirements relating to the initiation of adjudication proceedings, including the required content of a notice of charges initiating a hearing. In provisions modeled on the MARs and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> MARs, 11 T.M. Cooley L. Rev. at 96; Fed. R. Civ.

Unless the notice or stipulation of dismissal states otherwise, a dismissal pursuant to this section is without prejudice. In keeping with the principle that Bureau proceedings are presumed to be public, this section also provides that a notice of charges shall be released to the public after affording the respondent or others an opportunity to seek a protective order to shield confidential information.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>On its own initiative, the Bureau amended this section to include a new paragraph (d) to conform with the revisions made to § 1081.120 and to provide a procedural mechanism to commence an adjudication proceeding to effectuate a settlement agreed to before the filing of a notice of charges. As noted above, § 1081.120 has been revised to clarify that the settlement procedure laid out in that section applies only after a notice of charges has been issued. The Bureau recognizes, however, that settlement negotiations may commence prior to the filing of a notice of charges. In those circumstances, the Bureau may determine that an adjudication proceeding—rather than litigation elsewhere—is the most appropriate forum in which to enter a consent order. New paragraph (d) therefore provides that, where the parties agree to settlement before the filing of a notice of charges, a proceeding may be commenced by filing a stipulation and a consent order concluding the proceeding. Paragraph (d) also requires that certain information be included in the stipulation, tracking the information required under § 1081.120(d). Finally, in the interest of transparency, paragraph (d) requires that the consent order set forth the legal authority for the proceeding and for the Bureau's jurisdiction over the proceeding, and a statement of the matters of fact and law showing that the Bureau is entitled to relief. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1081.200(b)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.207 Production of Witness Statements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.231, this section provides that a respondent may request for inspection and copying any statement of a Division of Enforcement witness that (1) pertains to or is expected to pertain to his or her direct testimony; and (2) would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500, if the adjudication proceeding were a criminal proceeding. This section is intended to promote the principles of transparency and efficiency discussed with respect to § 1081.206. Note, however, that the respondent is required to move for the production of these statements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Jencks Act does not require production of a witness' prior statement until the witness takes the stand. The Bureau expects that in most cases, the Division of Enforcement will provide prehearing production voluntarily. Submission of a witness' prior statement, however, may provide a motive for intimidation of that witness or improper contact by a respondent with the witness. The rule provides, therefore, that the time for delivery of witness statements is to be determined by the hearing officer, so that a case-specific determination of such risks can be made if necessary. Upon a showing that there is substantial risk of improper use of a witness' prior statement, the hearing officer may take appropriate steps. For example, a hearing officer may delay production of a prior statement, or prohibit parties from communicating with particular witnesses.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.206 Availability of Documents for Inspection and Copying</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled primarily after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230, this section adopts the SEC's affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery in administrative adjudications. Generally, this section requires that the Division of Enforcement make available for inspection and copying certain categories of documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement prior to the institution of proceedings from persons not employed by the Bureau, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this section will promote the fair and efficient resolution of administrative proceedings. A respondent's right to inspect and copy documents under this section is automatic; the respondent does not need to make a formal request for access through the hearing officer. Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings. The respondent will have access to the documents, testimony, and other information that the Bureau relied upon in determining to file a notice of charges, in addition to evidence that the Bureau will rely upon at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This approach has several advantages. By automatically providing respondents with the factual information gathered by the Division of Enforcement in the course of the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings, this provision helps ensure that respondents have a complete understanding of the basis for the Bureau's action and can more accurately and efficiently determine the nature of their defenses or whether they wish to seek settlement. Because this approach renders traditional document discovery largely unnecessary, it will lead to a faster and more efficient resolution of Bureau administrative proceedings, saving both the Bureau and respondents the resources typically expended in the civil discovery process.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section adopts most of the procedures and conditions set forth in the SEC Rules, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), the Division of Enforcement's obligation under this section relates to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement. Documents located only in the files of other divisions or offices are beyond the scope of the rule. The term “documents” has been defined in the same manner as the term “documentary material” in section 1051(4) of the Act, and encompasses, among other things, electronic files or other data or data compilations stored in any medium.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(1) also provides that the Division of Enforcement will make the documents available for inspection and copying. This provision is modeled after the SEC Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau anticipates that in most cases it will simply provide either paper or electronic copies of the material at issue to respondents, but has adopted the formulation in the rule to preserve flexibility and the Division of Enforcement's right to require inspection and copying in appropriate cases.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) describe the types of documents that are subject to the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(1). Paragraph (a)(2) provides that the Division of Enforcement shall also make available each civil investigative demand or other written request to provide documents or to be interviewed issued by the Division of Enforcement in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall also make available any final examination or inspection reports prepared by any other Division of the Bureau if the Division of Enforcement either intends to introduce any such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, any witness. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) are included in the SEC Rules, but have been broken out into a separate paragraph of this section because they do not comprise documents that the Division of Enforcement obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau, and thus do not technically fall within the scope of paragraph (a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to § 1081.208, a respondent may seek production of other documents pursuant to subpoena. Paragraph (a)(3) is intended to make clear that the affirmative disclosure obligation set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) does not preclude the availability of subpoenas as separately provided by the Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(4) provides that this section does not require the Division of Enforcement to produce a final examination or inspection report prepared by any other Division of the Bureau to a respondent who is not the subject of that report. The Bureau has added this provision, which does not appear in the SEC Rules, out of concern for the privileged and confidential nature of examination and inspection reports and to make clear that respondents cannot rely upon the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to require the production of supervision or examination reports concerning other persons. Although the disclosure obligation as drafted would not require the production of such reports, the Bureau is adding this provision to remove any question regarding the issue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(1) of this section permits the Division of Enforcement to withhold documents that would otherwise be produced under paragraph (a) under five exceptions. Exception (i) shields information subject to a claim of privilege. Exception (ii) protects as work product internal documents prepared by persons employed by the Bureau, including consulting experts, which will not be offered in evidence. Work product includes any notes, working papers, memoranda or other similar materials, prepared by an attorney or under an attorney's direction in anticipation of litigation. <em data-original="E-03">See Hickman</em> v. <em data-original="E-03"> Taylor,</em> 329 U.S. 495 (1947); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) and (b)(5). Accountants, paralegals, investigators, and consulting experts who work on an investigation do so at the direction of the Director, an associate director, or another supervisory attorney, and their work product is therefore shielded by the rule. Although such material would not fall within the purview of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the Bureau has retained this provision of the SEC Rule to make clear that such work product is not subject to the affirmative disclosure obligation. An examination or inspection report prepared by one of the Bureau's Supervision Divisions, which the Division of Enforcement intends to introduce into evidence or to use to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, a witness, is explicitly excluded from the materials that may be withheld pursuant to this exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Exception (iii) protects the identity of a confidential source. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C) and (D). Exception (iv) provides that documents need not be produced where applicable law prohibits their production. Exception (v) protects any other document or category of documents that the hearing officer determines may be withheld as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding, or otherwise for good cause shown. This exception is intended to provide the hearing officer with the flexibility to adjust the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to the particular contours of a proceeding. For example, this exception could be used in a situation where a single investigation involves a discrete segment or segments that are related only indirectly, or not at all, to the recommendations ultimately made to the Director with respect to the particular respondents in a specific proceeding. To require that documents not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding be made available, simply because they were obtained as part of a broad investigation, burdens the respondent as well as the Division of Enforcement with unnecessary costs and delay.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that paragraph (b) does not authorize the Division of Enforcement to withhold material exculpatory evidence in the possession of the Division of Enforcement that would otherwise be subject to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a). Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will provide respondents with material exculpatory evidence it has obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau even if such evidence is contained in documents that the Division of Enforcement is otherwise permitted to withhold pursuant to paragraph (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has declined to adopt the SEC Rules' explicit reference to <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> v. <em data-original="E-03"> Maryland,</em> 373 U.S. 83 (1963) in this context. Proceedings under this part are civil in nature, not criminal, and the requirements of <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> are therefore inapplicable. The Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings, including any material exculpatory evidence so obtained. The Bureau understands this approach to be consistent with that provided for in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also added the clause “that would otherwise be required to be produced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section” to paragraph (b) to make clear that the material exculpatory evidence provision works in concert with paragraph (a), and does not impose a separate, free-standing obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence that is not otherwise within the scope of paragraph (a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) provides that the hearing officer may require the Division of Enforcement to submit a withheld document list, and may order that a withheld document be made available for inspection and copying.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (d), the Division of Enforcement is required to make the material governed by this section available for inspection and copying no later than seven days after service of the notice of charges. The Bureau has considered requiring production of the covered material at the time the notice of charges is served, but has decided against such an approach. A provision for a delay of no more than seven days will allow for the entry of any appropriate protective orders and is consistent with the SEC's approach in this regard. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 17 CFR 201.230(d). It is the Bureau's expectation that the Division of Enforcement will make this material available as soon as possible in every case.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (e) and (f) set forth the procedure to obtain copies of documents and the costs of such copies. As noted above, the Bureau anticipates providing electronic copies of the documents to respondents in most cases, and paragraph (f) accounts for such a provision of electronic documents. In order to preserve the discretion of the Division of Enforcement, however, this paragraph includes provisions governing the inspection and copying of documents. In order to provide for the safekeeping of documents subject to inspection, and to control costs associated with the implementation of this section, paragraph (e) provides that documents shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Bureau office where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties may agree. In cases in which electronic production is unwarranted, this process appears more likely to result in prompt access to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement that are the basis of the allegations contained in the notice of charges.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In a provision added by the Bureau, paragraph (g) of this section imposes upon the Division of Enforcement a duty to supplement its disclosures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it acquires information after making its disclosures that it intends to rely upon at a hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230(h), paragraph (h) provides for a “harmless error” standard in the event the Division of Enforcement fails to make available to a respondent a document required to be made available by this section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (i) is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31(g), and provides a “claw back” mechanism whereby inadvertent disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall not constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection, provided that the party took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Furthermore, paragraph (i) provides that disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall waive the privilege only if the waiver was intentional and that the scope of such waiver is limited to the undisclosed information or communications concerning the same subject matter, which in fairness ought to be considered together with the disclosed information or communications. Paragraph (i) expressly applies to disclosures made by any party during an adjudication proceeding.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisSection target="1081-206" notice="2012-14061" date="2012-06-29">
      <title>Section 1081.206 Availability of Documents for Inspection and Copying</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled primarily after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230, this section of the Interim Final Rule adopts the SEC's affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery in administrative adjudications. Generally, this section requires that the Office of Enforcement make available for inspection and copying certain categories of documents obtained by the Office of Enforcement prior to the institution of proceedings from persons not employed by the Bureau, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings, and certain categories of documents produced by persons employed by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments requesting amendment to this section. Before addressing each specific comment, the Bureau sets forth its understanding of this provision in order to provide guidance to both the public and future respondents regarding how it intends to comply with the affirmative disclosure obligations of § 1081.206.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau stated when it issued the Interim Final Rule, this section is intended to promote the fair and efficient resolution of adjudicatory proceedings. A respondent has an automatic right to inspect and copy documents under this section at the outset of the proceeding. The respondent is not required to make a formal request or wait until after the scheduling conference to gain access to documents underlying the Bureau's decision to initiate proceedings. Instead, the Bureau will provide the respondent with access to, in effect, the documents they would likely seek and obtain in the course of a protracted discovery period soon after service of the notice of charges.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This approach has several advantages. By automatically providing respondents with the factual information gathered by the Office of Enforcement in the course of the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings, this provision helps ensure that respondents have a complete understanding of the factual basis for the Bureau's action and can more accurately and efficiently determine the nature of their defenses or whether they wish to seek settlement. Because this approach renders traditional document discovery largely unnecessary, it will lead to a faster and more efficient resolution of Bureau administrative proceedings, saving both the Bureau and respondents the resources typically expended in the civil discovery process.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1081.206 adopts most of the procedures and conditions set forth in the SEC Rules, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), the Office of Enforcement's obligation under this section relates to documents obtained by the Office of Enforcement. Documents located only in the files of other divisions or offices of the Bureau are beyond the scope of paragraph (a). The term “ <em data-original="E-03">documents</em> ” has been defined in the same manner as the term “ <em data-original="E-03">documentary material</em> ” in section 1051(4) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5561(4), and encompasses, among other things, electronic files or other data or data compilations stored in any medium.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(1) also provides that the Office of Enforcement will make the documents available for inspection and copying. This provision is modeled after the SEC Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau anticipates that in most cases it will simply provide either paper or electronic copies of the material at issue to respondents, but has adopted the formulation in this section to preserve flexibility and the Office of Enforcement's right to require inspection and copying in appropriate cases.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) describe the types of documents that are subject to the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(1). The Bureau interprets its obligation under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to include both records obtained by the Office of Enforcement directly from persons not employed by the Bureau, as well as documents obtained by the Office of Enforcement indirectly from persons not employed by the Bureau. For example, if the Office of Enforcement obtains information from the Bureau's supervisory staff in connection with an investigation that the supervisory staff obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau, the Office of Enforcement will disclose such information, provided it is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(2) provides that the Office of Enforcement shall also make available each civil investigative demand or other written request to provide documents or to be interviewed issued by the Office of Enforcement in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. The Office of Enforcement shall also make available any final examination or inspection reports prepared by any other office of the Bureau if the Office of Enforcement either intends to introduce any such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, any witness. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) are included in the SEC Rules, but have been broken out into a separate paragraph of this section because they do not comprise documents that the Office of Enforcement obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau, and thus do not technically fall within the scope of paragraph (a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to § 1081.208, a respondent may seek production of other documents pursuant to subpoena. Paragraph (a)(3) is intended to make clear that the affirmative disclosure obligation set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) does not preclude the availability of subpoenas as separately provided by § 1081.208.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(4) provides that this section does not require the Office of Enforcement to produce a final examination or inspection report prepared by any other Office of the Bureau to a respondent who is not the subject of that report. The Bureau has included this provision, which does not appear in the SEC Rules, out of concern for the privileged and confidential nature of examination and inspection reports and to make clear that respondents cannot rely upon the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to require the production of supervision or examination reports concerning other persons. Although the disclosure obligation as drafted would not require the production of such reports, the Bureau included this provision to remove any question regarding the issue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(4) of the Interim Final Rule did not explicitly apply to final inspection or examination reports obtained from other government agencies. The Final Rule has been amended to clarify that such reports, to which the confidentiality and privilege concerns discussed above apply equally, are also excluded from the Bureau's disclosure obligation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(1) of the Interim Final Rule permitted the Office of Enforcement to withhold documents that would otherwise be produced under paragraph (a) under five exceptions. The Final Rule retains these exceptions and adds an additional exception, paragraph (b)(1)(iii), as described below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The first exception, in paragraph (b)(1)(i) shields information subject to a claim of privilege. The second exception, in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), protects as work product internal documents prepared by persons employed by the Bureau, including consulting experts, which will not be offered in evidence. Work product includes any notes, working papers, memoranda or other similar materials, prepared by an attorney or under an attorney's direction in anticipation of litigation. <em data-original="E-03">See Hickman</em> v. <em data-original="E-03">Taylor,</em> 329 U.S. 495 (1947); <em data-original="E-03">see also</em> Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) and (b)(5). Accountants, paralegals, investigators, and consulting experts who work on an investigation do so at the direction of the Director, an associate director, or another supervisory attorney, and their work product is therefore not subject to the affirmative disclosure obligation. Although such material would not fall within the purview of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the Bureau has retained this provision of the SEC Rules to make clear that such work product is not subject to the affirmative disclosure obligation. An examination or inspection report prepared by one of the Bureau's supervision offices, which the Office of Enforcement intends to introduce into evidence or to use to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, a witness, is explicitly excluded from the materials that may be withheld pursuant to this exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The third exception, contained in paragraph (b)(1)(iii), is added to the Final Rule. Modeled upon a similar provision in the Rules of Practice of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 17 CFR 10.42, this paragraph protects documents obtained from other governmental entities that are either not relevant to the proceeding or were provided to the Bureau on the condition that the information not be disclosed. The Bureau has added this provision to accommodate any agreements limiting the disclosure of documents received from other governmental entities. To the extent the Bureau withholds documents pursuant to this exception, it will not rely upon those documents at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The fourth exception, contained in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of the Final Rule, protects the identity of a confidential source. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C) and (D). The fifth exception, contained in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of the Final Rule, provides that documents need not be produced where applicable law prohibits their production. The final exception protects any other document or category of documents that the hearing officer determines may be withheld as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding, or otherwise for good cause shown. This exception is intended to provide the hearing officer with the flexibility to adjust the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to the particular contours of a proceeding. For example, this exception could be used in a situation where a single investigation involves other industry participants that are related only indirectly, or not at all, to the recommendations ultimately made to the Director with respect to the particular respondents in a specific proceeding. To require that documents not relevant to the proceeding be made available, simply because they were obtained as part of a broad investigation, burdens the respondent as well as the Office of Enforcement with unnecessary costs and delay.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that paragraph (b) does not authorize the Office of Enforcement to withhold material exculpatory evidence in the possession of the Office of Enforcement that would otherwise be subject to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a). Pursuant to this section, the Office of Enforcement will provide respondents with material exculpatory evidence it has obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau even if such evidence is contained in documents that the Office of Enforcement is otherwise permitted to withhold pursuant to paragraph (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to adopt the SEC Rules' explicit reference to <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> v. <em data-original="E-03">Maryland,</em> 373 U.S. 83 (1963) in this context. Proceedings under this part are civil in nature, not criminal, and the requirements of <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> are therefore inapplicable. The Office of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings, including any material exculpatory evidence so obtained. The Bureau understands this approach to be consistent with that provided for in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also adds the clause “that would otherwise be required to be produced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section” to paragraph (b) to make clear that the material exculpatory evidence provision works in concert with paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) does not impose a separate, free-standing obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence that is not otherwise within the scope of paragraph (a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) provides that the hearing officer may require the Office of Enforcement to submit a withheld document list, and may order that a withheld document be made available for inspection and copying. Paragraph (c) has been amended to incorporate a provision from the Rules of Practice of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 17 CFR 10.42. This provision limits the disclosures that the Bureau will make with respect to documents withheld pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii). The Bureau will inform the other parties of the fact that such documents are being withheld, but will not make further disclosures regarding those documents. Like paragraph (b)(1)(iii), this provision was added to enable the Bureau to comply with agreements limiting the disclosure of documents received from other governmental entities.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (d), the Office of Enforcement is required to make the material governed by this section available for inspection and copying no later than seven days after service of the notice of charges unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer. The Bureau has considered requiring production of the covered material at the time the notice of charges is served, but has decided against such an approach. A provision for a delay of no more than seven days will allow parties to move for any appropriate protective orders and is consistent with the SEC's approach in this regard. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 17 CFR 201.230(d). The Bureau notes that, if seven days after the service of a notice of charges a motion for a protective order is pending but has not yet been ruled upon, production of the documents that are the subject of the motion could be delayed. The hearing officer could order temporary remedies where appropriate, such as the production of redacted copies pending a decision on the motion for a protective order. It is the Bureau's expectation that the Office of Enforcement will make the material available as soon as possible in every case.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (e) and (f) set forth the procedure to obtain copies of documents and the costs of such copies. As noted above, the Bureau anticipates providing electronic copies of the documents to respondents in most cases, and paragraph (f) accounts for such a provision of electronic documents. In order to preserve the discretion of the Office of Enforcement, however, this paragraph includes provisions governing the inspection and copying of documents. In order to provide for the safekeeping of documents subject to inspection, and to control costs associated with the implementation of this section, paragraph (e) provides that documents shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Bureau office where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties may agree. In cases in which electronic production is unwarranted, this process appears more likely to result in prompt access to documents obtained by the Office of Enforcement that are the basis of the allegations contained in the notice of charges.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (g) of this section imposes upon the Office of Enforcement a duty to supplement its disclosures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it acquires information after making its disclosures that it intends to rely upon at a hearing. Although the SEC Rules do not include an analogous provision, the Bureau believes that imposing a duty to supplement will reduce the need for unnecessary discovery requests.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230(h), paragraph (h) provides for a “harmless error” standard in the event the Office of Enforcement fails to make available to a respondent a document required to be made available by this section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (i) is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31(g), and provides a “claw back” mechanism whereby inadvertent disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall not constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection, provided that the party took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Furthermore, paragraph (i) provides that disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall waive the privilege only if the waiver was intentional and that the scope of such waiver is limited to the undisclosed information or communications concerning the same subject matter, which in fairness ought to be considered together with the disclosed information or communications. Paragraph (i) expressly applies to disclosures made by any party during an adjudication proceeding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments to this section, and will address them in turn.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> One commenter asserted that the “affirmative disclosure” approach puts respondents at a significant disadvantage to the Bureau, because the Bureau, unlike the respondent, will have already gathered all of the information it needs to prepare for the hearing through examinations and investigation proceedings as well as through its ability to collect consumer complaints and collect information from covered persons.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> While the Bureau will have already conducted an investigation prior to filing its notice of charges, the “affirmative disclosure” approach will give a respondent automatic access to the vast majority of the documents gathered as part of that investigation. Production to respondents will include any consumer complaints or documents from covered persons that enforcement counsel obtained in connection with the investigation, provided that production of those documents would not reveal the identity of a confidential source or otherwise fall within the scope of one of the relevant exceptions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This approach will provide respondents automatic access to the factual information gathered by the Office of Enforcement in the course of the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. As a result, the process will help ensure that respondents have a complete understanding of the basis for the Bureau's action, and can assess their defenses accordingly. If necessary, respondents may seek to obtain additional information through subpoena.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the exceptions to the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation do not disadvantage respondents as compared to traditional civil discovery because the exceptions protect documents that often would be protected in traditional civil discovery. When producing documents in traditional discovery, litigants routinely seek protection for documents that (i) are privileged; (ii) constitute work product; (iii) are irrelevant or required to be kept confidential; (iv) would reveal the identity of a confidential source; <footnote ref="3">As discussed below, information provided by a confidential source, and in some cases even that source's identity, will be made available to the extent the Bureau plans to call that source as a witness, rely upon information he or she provided, or to the extent the information is exculpatory.</footnote>
             (v) are prohibited from production by applicable law; or (vi) are deemed by the hearing officer or judge to be not relevant to the subject matter or otherwise not subject to production for good cause shown.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In short, the Bureau believes the affirmative disclosure process will promote a fair and efficient resolution of administrative proceedings without placing the respondent at an unfair disadvantage.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> Respondents should be permitted to (a) depose third parties who have direct knowledge of relevant matters; (b) issue and enforce subpoenas for documents and testimony, and (c) serve third parties with interrogatories.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau declines to make these changes. The Bureau considered allowing third-party depositions or interrogatories but declined to do so because the need for these third-party discovery tools will likely be met through the discovery mechanisms that are available under the Final Rule, and because of the potential for third-party depositions and interrogatories to delay the proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Even without third-party discovery depositions, respondents will be able to present testimony of third-parties with knowledge of relevant matters at the hearing to support their defense. Pursuant to § 1081.208, respondents may request the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of a witness at the hearing. If a witness is unavailable for the hearing, a respondent may take that witness's deposition and introduce that testimony on the record at a hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the marginal benefit of permitting third-party interrogatories is not justified in light of the likelihood that disputes over interrogatories may delay the proceedings. The Bureau notes that neither the SEC's Rules nor the Uniform Rules permit prehearing discovery depositions or interrogatories.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As drafted, § 1081.208 requires a party to request the issuance of a subpoena from the hearing officer, and generally requires the Bureau to seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas. The Bureau considered whether to permit parties to issue subpoenas. The Bureau declined to do so because a hearing officer can help ensure that subpoenas are not “unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome.” The commenter requested that respondents be permitted to enforce subpoenas, but the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Bureau to do so. 12 U.S.C. 5562(b)(2). The Bureau's General Counsel will enforce subpoenas on relation of a respondent, provided such enforcement is consistent with the law and the policies of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The third-party discovery permitted by the Interim Final Rule is consistent with the practice of the SEC, which shares a common approach to discovery with the Bureau. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 17 CFR 201.230-234. It is also consistent with the Uniform Rules, which, like the Interim Final Rule, allow third-party depositions only when a witness is unavailable for hearing, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> 12 CFR 19.27, and require parties to apply to the administrative law judge for a third-party document subpoena, which may be granted only if the administrative law judge determines the subpoena is not “unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 19.26. Like the SEC, the Bureau will make documents available to respondents through the affirmative disclosure process. As a result, traditional discovery is limited, and it is appropriate to require parties to request issuance of a subpoena in order to ensure that the Bureau's subpoena power is exercised appropriately and not for purposes of delay or obstruction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This practice is also appropriate considering that respondents must demonstrate that a witness is unavailable for the hearing in order to obtain a deposition subpoena. This standard is more easily enforced if a party has to request, and a hearing officer has to issue, those subpoenas. The SEC and the Uniform Rules both restrict depositions to circumstances when a witness will not be available for the hearing, and both require parties to request or apply for a deposition subpoena.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> It is unclear whether the affirmative disclosure process limits the right of respondents to seek other documents from the Bureau through subpoena. Respondents may be prevented from seeking certain documents through subpoena on the grounds that it could physically inspect and copy those same documents through the affirmative disclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> Section 1081.208 permits a respondent to seek other documents from the Bureau through subpoena. Such a subpoena would presumably not be necessary if the documents sought by the respondent were included in the affirmative disclosure production, but the existence of that process does not negate a respondent's right to request a subpoena for other relevant documents in the possession of the Bureau, as the Interim Final Rule makes clear in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1081.206.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The affirmative disclosure process covers documents that are “obtained by the Office of Enforcement.” Whether documents are relevant and should be discoverable is unrelated to who at the Bureau “obtained” the documents. This could lead to protracted litigation over who “obtained” a document that a Bureau employee sees and reads but does not touch.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The affirmative disclosure process outlined in § 1081.206 is based upon the SEC's affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery in administrative adjudications. The “obtained by” the Office of Enforcement language is taken directly from the SEC Rules. Section 1081.206 is intended to give respondents access to the material facts underlying enforcement counsel's decision to recommend the commencement of enforcement proceedings. It is not intended to create an obligation for enforcement counsel to search the files of other divisions or offices in the Bureau. As explained above, the Bureau will include in its affirmative disclosure documents obtained by other elements of the Bureau from persons not employed by the Bureau and later provided to the Office of Enforcement for its use “in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings.” § 1081.206(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> Disclosure should not be limited to documents obtained “in connection with the investigation.” The Bureau might have come across relevant, discoverable information without an investigation. For example, a State may conduct an investigation and turn its findings over to the Bureau and the Bureau could bring charges based on the State's findings. Or the Bureau may issue a notice of charges based upon examination findings without an investigation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Office of Enforcement will not interpret the phrase “in connection with the investigation” in the manner contemplated by this commenter. Through the affirmative disclosure process, the Office of Enforcement will turn over the documents that informed its decision to recommend the institution of proceedings, except to the extent those documents meet an exception outlined in § 1081.206. In the first example offered by this commenter, the Office of Enforcement would consider documents turned over by a State that formed the basis for the Office's recommendation to bring charges against a respondent to have been obtained “in connection with the investigation.” The Bureau would disclose those documents to the respondent unless they were provided to the Bureau on the condition that they not be disclosed, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1081.206(b)(1)(iii), or unless the State obtained a protective order to prevent their disclosure, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1081.119(a). If documents were withheld from the respondent for either of these reasons, the Bureau would not rely upon those documents in the proceeding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau would consider information obtained by the Office of Enforcement through the Bureau's supervisory channels to be obtained “in connection with the investigation” if such information formed the factual basis of an enforcement action.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The section excludes from discovery, in all cases, final examination “or inspection” reports to respondents who are not the subject of the report. Such an absolute limit on discovery, regardless of the significance of the information, is not appropriate. Further, the term “inspection” could mean almost anything, such as notes a Bureau employee takes when asking anyone a question about a covered person.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> Paragraph (a)(4) is intended to make clear that respondents have no automatic right to examination or inspection reports related to other entities. Nothing in the Interim Final Rule prevents a respondent from seeking a final examination or inspection report regarding another entity through subpoena, although given the confidential nature of such reports the Bureau would anticipate that such subpoena requests would generally be denied. Finally, the Bureau does not intend for the term “inspection report” to cover interview notes, for purposes of this section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The Interim Final Rule requires the Bureau to turn over documents “obtained” by the Bureau's Office of Enforcement before the notice of charges issued. When the Bureau obtained documents is not relevant to whether they should be discoverable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau agrees that relevant documents upon which the Bureau intends to rely should be made available to the respondent even if they are obtained after the issuance of a notice of charges. Paragraph (g) obligates the Bureau to supplement its disclosures with any additional information that it intends to rely upon at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The Interim Final Rule creates an incentive for Bureau employees to withhold material exculpatory evidence from the Office of Enforcement because delivering it could make it discoverable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau has no independent legal obligation to produce material exculpatory evidence <em data-original="E-03">sua sponte.</em> Section 1081.206 of the Interim Final Rule provides for such production, but does so in a manner that is workable and practical. It is intended to ensure that respondents are in possession of material exculpatory information obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau that enforcement counsel has considered in its determination to recommend enforcement action. Extending the scope of the Interim Final Rule to cover exculpatory evidence that is not in the Office of Enforcement's possession would impose an unworkable and legally unfounded obligation on enforcement counsel and the rest of the Bureau. Furthermore, § 1081.208 enables respondents to subpoena additional documents that they believe are relevant to their defense.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> This section is based upon the SEC Rules, but the SEC does not examine all of the institutions it regulates so does not necessarily have relevant, nonpublic materials outside of the Office of Enforcement. The Bureau should not be able to declare all of these materials to be per se beyond the scope of discovery without allowing respondent to seek a determination as to whether any of the materials are relevant.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau does not believe that its supervisory powers require further amendment of this section. Aside from privileged internal notes and working papers generated by Bureau employees, the documents obtained by the Bureau through the exercise of its supervisory authority will come almost exclusively from the institution itself. The institution will have provided the documents to the Bureau, and cannot claim to be deprived of access to such documents in discovery. The purpose of affirmative disclosure is to give the respondent access to all of the material evidence underlying enforcement counsel's decision to commence enforcement proceedings. Rather than provide the respondent with access to all of the documents that in any way relate to it or its business—including many completely unrelated to the proceeding—enforcement counsel will turn over those documents that enforcement counsel obtained or considered in its decision to proceed in the particular action.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, respondents will have the ability to conduct some limited discovery, including document subpoenas, depositions of third-parties who are unavailable for the hearing, and, in some circumstances, limited expert discovery.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> This section permits the Bureau to withhold documents that “would disclose the identity of a confidential source,” which is inappropriate and not based upon the Uniform Rules or the SEC Rules. The respondent should be permitted to impeach the credibility of all witnesses. This section should be deleted, and in its place the Bureau should be required to produce “a list identifying all persons or entities that have made allegations or accusations relevant to any matters being heard.” If the person or entity is not sufficiently identified to be called as a witness, all evidence relating to or derived from the allegations or accusations is inadmissible.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The commenter is incorrect in asserting that this exception to the affirmative disclosure obligation is not based upon the SEC Rules—the language is identical to the SEC Rules. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 17 CFR 201.230(b)(1)(iii). A respondent's ability to impeach the credibility of a witness will not be impacted by this exception to the affirmative disclosure obligation. The Bureau will identify any individual on whose testimony the Bureau intends to rely at the hearing, whether or not that individual came to the Bureau as a confidential source. The Bureau must prove all of its assertions at the hearing, and the respondent will have the ability to challenge all evidence offered.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The Office of Enforcement should be required to produce relevant materials without the hearing officer ordering production, and the Interim Final Rule should be revised to require the Office of Enforcement to produce a detailed log of the bases for withholding any privileged materials.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Office of Enforcement is required by § 1081.206 to disclose the documents described in the section without a separate order from the hearing officer. The Bureau does not believe that the affirmative disclosure obligation, which is based upon and substantively the same as that found in the SEC Rules, should be broadened further. The material subject to affirmative disclosure will provide respondents with access to all, or nearly all, of the information obtained by enforcement counsel in the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. With respect to privilege logs, the Bureau adopts language from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201. 230(c). The hearing officer may require that the Office of Enforcement submit a list of documents or categories of documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) and (iv) through (vi), and the hearing officer may so order when appropriate. (As discussed above, with respect to documents withheld pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the Bureau must inform respondent that such documents are being withheld, but no further disclosure is required.) To require the Bureau to produce a withheld document list in all cases, even when not deemed appropriate by the hearing officer, would be unnecessary and unduly burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The Bureau should complete, rather than commence, production of the affirmative disclosure documents within seven days.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau fully intends to supply all affirmative disclosure documents to respondents within seven days except in extraordinary circumstances (such as when a motion for protective order is pending on the seventh day). The Bureau adopted the language of this section from the SEC Rules, and has decided to retain the language in order to allow flexibility in those rare circumstances where a full production within seven days is not feasible, such as when a motion for a protective order is pending with respect to some of the documents. The Bureau expects these situations to arise very infrequently if at all, and expects to complete production within seven days in most cases.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comment:</em> The Bureau should be required to produce all documents electronically. Photocopying should not be required.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Response:</em> The Bureau adopted the language regarding photocopying from the SEC Rules, but as indicated in the preamble to § 1081.206, the Bureau anticipates providing electronic copies of documents to respondents in most cases. The Bureau is retaining the language regarding photocopying in order to retain its discretion, particularly in cases where the safekeeping of documents subject to inspection and the cost of production may be of particular concern. The Bureau expects these cases to be rare.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.205 Non-Dispositive Motions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section governs all motions other than motions to dismiss or motions for summary disposition, which are governed by § 212. The section generally sets forth the requirements for filing a non-dispositive motion, and requires that all such motions must be in writing, state with particularity the relief sought, and include a proposed order. This section also makes clear that motions filed pursuant to sections that impose different requirements should follow those requirements, and the requirements of § 205 to the extent they are not inconsistent. For example, § 208(g), which relates to motions to quash subpoenas, provides for a shorter time period for the filing of a responsive brief and prohibits the filing of a reply unless requested by the hearing officer. These conditions govern motions to quash, but such motions are still subject to other provisions of § 205, including, <em data-original="E-03">inter alia,</em> the need to meet and confer, deadlines for the hearing officer's ruling, and length limitations of the briefs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the Uniform Rules and the FTC Rules, 12 CFR 19.23(d)(1); 16 CFR 3.22(d), this section gives a party 10 days after service of a non-dispositive motion to respond to such motion in writing. It provides for reply briefs, which must be filed within three days after service of the response. A party's failure to respond to a motion shall waive that party's right to oppose such motion and constitutes consent to the entry of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying that motion. This section adopts the SEC's 15-page length limitation for non-dispositive motions and oppositions, 17 CFR 201.154(c), and a six page length limitation for reply briefs. The Bureau has adopted these time and length limitations because they provide parties ample opportunity to express their views on matters that do not concern the ultimate disposition of the action.
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section also requires parties to make a good faith effort to meet and confer prior to the filing of a non-dispositive motion in an effort to resolve the controversy by agreement. The Bureau has included the meet-and-confer requirement because it believes that such conferences can help obviate the need for, or narrow the scope of, disputed motions, thus saving both the parties and the hearing officer time and resources.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section provides that the hearing officer shall rule on a non-dispositive motion, and shall do so within 14 days after the expiration of the time for filing of all motions papers authorized by this section, and that the pendency of a motion shall not stay proceedings. This time limitation is based on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.22(e), and is intended to ensure the timely resolution of disputes so that the proceeding as a whole can conclude in a fair and expeditious manner. As noted above, both the FTC and the SEC have revised their rules of practice to provide for the more expeditious resolution of administrative adjudications, and the incorporation of a time period in which the hearing officer must rule on a non-dispositive motion is, in the views of the Bureau, a critical part of that effort. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 73 FR 58831, 58836 (Oct. 7, 2008) (FTC expects that provision requiring ALJs to decide motions within 14 days will expedite cases).</analysisParagraph>

The Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.36(c)(2), on which this paragraph is modeled, is promulgated by each of the prudential regulators, and therefore the intent of this paragraph is, in part, for each regulator to have its own documents be deemed presumptively admissible.

      <title>Section 1081.209 Deposition of Witness Unavailable for Hearing</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section, generally modeled after the Uniform Rules and the SEC Rules, 12 CFR 19.27; 17 CFR 201.233, provides that parties may seek to depose material witnesses unavailable for the hearing upon application to the hearing officer for a deposition subpoena. The application must state that the witness is expected to be unavailable due to age, illness, infirmity or other reason and that the petitioning party was not the cause of the witness's unavailability. The Bureau has adopted the Uniform Rules' formulation of this standard, which provides for such depositions when the witness is “otherwise unavailable,” to account for the possible unavailability of witnesses for reasons other than those specified in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(2) requires a party seeking to record a deposition by audio-visual means to so note in the request for a deposition subpoena. This provision is modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(3). Paragraph (a)(4) also provides that a deposition cannot be taken on less than 14 days' notice to the witness and all parties, absent an order to the contrary from the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) incorporates several provisions from the SEC Rules. It provides that the witness being deposed may have an attorney present during the deposition; that objections to questions of evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer, but that only the hearing officer shall have the power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevance of evidence; that the deposition shall be filed with the Executive Secretary; and that transcripts shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also incorporates certain procedures from § 208 of the Rules pertaining to subpoenas. Those procedures are intended to protect against deposition requests that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, and to provide a mechanism for signing and service of a deposition subpoena, the filing of a motion to quash, and for enforcing subpoenas.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered whether respondents should be allowed to issue subpoenas for the purpose of compelling prehearing discovery depositions as is allowed in actions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including deposition practice, is often a source of delay, extensive collateral disputes and high litigation costs. The Bureau believes expanding the scope of prehearing discovery to permit discovery depositions is not warranted for several reasons.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, the Bureau believes that even if limitations were placed on the availability of discovery depositions, there remains a significant potential for extensive collateral litigation over their use. Second, use of discovery depositions is in tension with the statutory timetable for hearings in cease-and-desist proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act. Indeed, in part for this reason, the Rules allow the hearing officer to decide whether and to what extent to permit expert discovery in adjudication proceedings. Allowing prehearing depositions would present extreme scheduling difficulties in those cases in which respondents did not request hearing dates outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Third, the rationale for permitting oral depositions in litigation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply equally to a Bureau administrative proceeding. In the typical civil action between private parties, where neither party can compel testimony prior to the filing of the complaint, oral depositions play a critical role in permitting evidence to be gathered prior to trial. Here, by contrast, the Bureau can compel such testimony and is committed to making it available to respondents pursuant to § 1081.206.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, these Rules include three provisions that address in significant part a respondent's interest in obtaining discovery prior to the start of the hearing. Section 1081.206 mandates that the Division of Enforcement generally make available not only transcripts of testimony, but documents obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau during the investigation leading to the proceeding as well as certain documents of the Bureau. Section 1081.208 authorizes the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for the production of documents returnable at any designated time or place. In addition, § 1081.210 provides for expert discovery in appropriate cases. Given these discovery mechanisms, the ability to subpoena witnesses to testify at the hearing, the ability to take the deposition of material witnesses unavailable for hearing, and the ability of respondents to conduct informal discovery, the marginal benefits of prehearing depositions are not justified by their likely cost in time, expense, collateral disputes and scheduling complexities.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.209 Deposition of Witness Unavailable for Hearing</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule, generally modeled after the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.27, and the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.233, provides that parties may seek to depose material witnesses unavailable for the hearing upon application to the hearing officer for a deposition subpoena. The application must state that the witness is expected to be unavailable due to age, illness, infirmity or other reason and that the petitioning party was not the cause of the witness's unavailability. The Bureau has adopted the Uniform Rules' formulation of this standard, which provides for such depositions when the witness is “otherwise unavailable,” to account for the possible unavailability of witnesses for reasons other than those specified in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(2) requires a party seeking to record a deposition by audio-visual means to so note in the request for a deposition subpoena. This provision is modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(3). Paragraph (a)(4) also provides that a deposition cannot be taken on less than 14 days' notice to the witness and all parties, absent an order to the contrary from the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (g) incorporates several provisions from the SEC Rules. It provides that the witness being deposed may have an attorney present during the deposition; that objections to questions of evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer, but that only the hearing officer shall have the power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevance of evidence; and that transcripts shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase. Paragraph (g) of the Final Rule was amended slightly to provide that the deposition shall be filed with the Office of Administrative Adjudication (as opposed to the Executive Secretary as set forth in the Interim Final Rule).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) of this section also incorporates certain procedures from § 1081.208 of the Interim Final Rule pertaining to subpoenas. Those procedures are intended to protect against deposition requests that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, and to provide a mechanism for signing and service of a deposition subpoena, the filing of a motion to quash, and for enforcing subpoenas. This paragraph was amended slightly to conform to the amendments to § 1081.208.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that respondents should be permitted to conduct pre-hearing depositions of third parties with relevant information, even if such witnesses will be available for the hearing. In promulgating the Interim Final Rule, the Bureau considered whether respondents should be allowed to issue subpoenas for the purpose of compelling prehearing discovery depositions as is allowed in actions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau believes expanding the scope of prehearing discovery to permit discovery depositions is not warranted for several reasons.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, the Bureau believes that even if limitations were placed on the availability of discovery depositions, there remains a significant potential for extensive collateral litigation over their use. Second, use of discovery depositions is in tension with the statutory timetable for hearings in cease-and-desist proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Indeed, in part for these reasons, the Final Rule, like the Interim Final Rule, allows the hearing officer to decide whether and to what extent to permit expert discovery in adjudication proceedings. Allowing prehearing depositions would present extreme scheduling difficulties in those cases in which respondents did not request hearing dates outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Final Rule includes three provisions that address in significant part a respondent's interest in obtaining discovery prior to the start of the hearing. Section 1081.206 mandates that the Office of Enforcement generally make available not only transcripts of testimony, but documents obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau during the investigation leading to the initiation of the proceeding, as well as certain documents of the Bureau. Section 1081.208 authorizes the issuance of subpoenas <em data-original="E-03">duces tecum</em> for the production of documents returnable at any designated time or place. In addition, § 1081.210 provides for expert discovery in appropriate cases. Given these discovery mechanisms, the ability to subpoena witnesses to testify at the hearing, the ability to take the deposition of material witnesses unavailable for hearing, and the ability of respondents to conduct informal discovery, the Bureau continues to believe that the marginal benefits of prehearing depositions are not justified by their likely cost in time, expense, collateral disputes and scheduling complexities.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.208 Subpoenas</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section is modeled after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.232, and provides that, in connection with a hearing, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of a witness or the production of documents. The availability of subpoenas for witnesses and documents ensures that respondents have available to them the necessary tools to adduce evidence in support of their defenses. A subpoena may only be issued by the hearing officer (as opposed to counsel) and the section sets forth procedures to prevent the issuance of subpoenas that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome. The section also sets forth procedures and standards applicable to a motion to quash or modify a subpoena.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) of this section also provides that, if a subpoenaed person fails to comply, the Bureau, on its own motion or on the motion of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued, may seek an order requiring compliance. In accordance with section 1052(b)(2) of the Act, which authorizes the Bureau or a Bureau investigator to seek enforcement of a subpoena, paragraph (h) only authorizes the Bureau—and not the party at whose request the subpoena was issued—to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena. <em data-original="E-03">Compare</em> 12 CFR 19.26(c) (authorizing the “subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party” to seek judicial enforcement). In a provision added by the Bureau, this section also provides that failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought. This provision was added to prevent a respondent from declining to request that the Bureau seek to enforce the subpoena of a witness who fails to comply, and later claiming that his or her defense was prejudiced based upon the unavailability of that witness.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (i) (which was paragraph (h) in the Interim Final Rule) of this section also provides that, if a subpoenaed person fails to comply, the Bureau, on its own motion or on the motion of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued, may seek a judicial order requiring compliance. In accordance with section 1052(b)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau or a Bureau investigator to seek enforcement of a subpoena, paragraph (i) only authorizes the Bureau—and not the party at whose request the subpoena was issued—to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena. <em data-original="E-03">Compare</em> 12 U.S.C. 1818(n) (authorizing any party to proceedings brought pursuant to 1818 to bring an action to enforce a subpoena issued in connection with the proceeding); 12 CFR 19.26(c) (authorizing the “subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party” to seek judicial enforcement). In a provision added by the Bureau, this section also sets forth that failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought. This provision was added to prevent a respondent from declining to request that the Bureau seek to enforce the subpoena of a witness who fails to comply, and later claiming that his or her defense was prejudiced based upon the unavailability of that witness. The Bureau amended § 1081.208(h) of the Interim Final Rule (which is paragraph (i) in the Final Rule) to clarify that the General Counsel will initiate actions to enforce subpoenas on behalf of respondents, with the expectation that respondents will intervene to litigate on their own behalf. This will prevent conflicts that could arise were enforcement counsel required to enforce a subpoena sought by respondents in a proceeding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter asserted that respondents should be permitted to issue and enforce subpoenas. The Bureau's substantive response to this comment is discussed above in the context of a similar comment addressing § 1081.206.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Another commenter stated that the hearing officer should not be permitted to delegate the manual signing of deposition subpoenas, as there needs to be a basic check on the issuance of subpoenas, such as review by the hearing officer. This section provides that a hearing officer must issue a subpoena only upon the request of a party, which includes either respondents or the Bureau, and only if the hearing officer determines that the subpoena is not “unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) of the Interim Final Rule permitted the hearing officer to delegate the manual signing of the subpoena to “any other person authorized to issue subpoenas,” which includes enforcement counsel. The Bureau has revised paragraph (c) to provide that the hearing officer may delegate the manual signing of the subpoena “to any other person.” This will give the hearing officer, in the interests of efficiency, the option of allowing counsel for either party to manually sign subpoenas after they have been issued by the hearing officer. But this delegation, should it occur, does not permit the issuance of subpoenas without the hearing officer's independent review and consent.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau on its own initiative added new paragraph (g) to § 1081.208. This paragraph requires a person responding to a subpoena for documentary material to file a sworn certificate of compliance with the subpoena response. This is intended to confirm that all of the documentary material required by the subpoena and in the possession, custody, or control of the person to whom the subpoena is directed has been produced and made available to the custodian.</analysisParagraph>

The term “ <em data-original="E-03">Director”</em> has been defined to include the Director, as well as any person authorized to perform the functions of the Director in accordance with the law. This is intended to allow the Deputy Director or Acting Director, or a delegee of the Director, as appropriate, to perform the functions of the Director. It is also intended to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to perform certain functions of the Director in accordance with section 1066 of the Act.

As previously noted, the Bureau currently intends to issue rules governing the issuance of temporary orders to cease and desist in the future.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau intends for the term “ <em data-original="E-03">counsel</em> ” to include any individual representing a party, including, as appropriate, an individual representing himself or herself. The term “ <em data-original="E-03">Director</em> ” has been defined to include the Director, as well as any person authorized to perform the functions of the Director in accordance with the law. This is intended to allow the Deputy Director, or a delegee of the Director, as appropriate, to perform the functions of the Director. The term “ <em data-original="E-03">person employed by the Bureau</em> ” is defined to include Bureau employees and contractors as well as others working under the direction of Bureau personnel, and is intended to encompass, among other things, consulting experts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On its own initiative, the Bureau replaced the defined term “ <em data-original="E-03">Act,</em> ” which had been defined as the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, with the defined term “ <em data-original="E-03">Dodd-Frank Act</em> ” and defined “ <em data-original="E-03">Dodd-Frank Act</em> ” to mean the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On its own initiative, the Bureau has included a new definition in the Final Rule for the “ <em data-original="E-03">Office of Administrative Adjudication.</em> ” The Interim Final Rule provided that the receipt of filings and certain other administrative tasks related to the Director's review of recommended decisions would be performed by the Bureau's Executive Secretary. After publication of the Interim Final Rule, the Bureau formed an Office of Administrative Adjudication to perform these functions. The Final Rule has been amended to reflect the creation of the Office of Administrative Adjudication and the transfer of the Executive Secretary's duties in adjudication proceedings to this Office. The defined term “ <em data-original="E-03">Executive Secretary</em> ” has been removed from § 1081.103 as unnecessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.104 Authority of the Hearing Officer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section enumerates powers granted to the hearing officer subsequent to appointment. The list of powers in paragraph (b) is not intended to be exhaustive. The hearing officer is permitted to take any other action necessary and appropriate to discharge the duties of a presiding officer. All powers granted by this provision are intended to further the Bureau's goal of an expeditious, fair, and impartial hearing process. The powers set forth in this section are generally drawn from the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. 556, 557, and are similar to the powers granted to hearing officers and administrative law judges under the Uniform Rules, the SEC Rules, and the FTC Rules.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule enumerates powers granted to the hearing officer subsequent to appointment.

M. Cooley L. Rev. at 83.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter recommended that this section be revised to make clear that the hearing officer has the authority to provide a person requesting confidential treatment of information the time to come into compliance with applicable requirements before making a determination regarding confidentiality. The commenter expressed concern that the section as drafted authorized the hearing officer to immediately make public purportedly confidential material if the applicable requirements were not met.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the section as drafted adequately addresses this circumstance. The hearing officer is authorized to “deny confidential status to documents and testimony <em data-original="E-03">without prejudice</em> until a party complies with all relevant rules” (emphasis added). The inclusion of the “without prejudice” language authorizes the hearing officer to treat material as confidential while the party attempts to comply with the relevant rules. It also provides the hearing officer the authority to deny confidential status to documents when appropriate; for example, if a party repeatedly and/or willfully fails to comply with the requirements of the Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section permits the hearing officer to deny confidential status without prejudice until a party complies with “all relevant rules.” The commenter stated that the reference to “all relevant rules” is vague because the adjudication proceeding could be based on a respondent's alleged noncompliance with other rules. The commenter questioned whether the respondent would have to comply with those other rules before the hearing officer will treat material as confidential for the purposes of the adjudication proceeding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not anticipate that the hearing officer will confuse the substantive rules the respondent is alleged to have violated with the procedural rules governing the treatment of purportedly confidential material. In light of this comment, however, and in the interest of providing covered persons additional guidance, the Bureau directs parties to §§ 1081.111, 1081.112, and 1081.119, as well as any applicable orders of the Director or hearing officer and any guidance issued by the Office of Administrative Adjudication, as the relevant rules with which persons seeking confidential treatment of material must comply.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the commenter stated that the hearing officer's authority to “reject written submissions that fail to comply with the requirements of this part, and to deny confidential status to documents and testimony without prejudice until a party complies with all relevant rules” was unclear. The commenter suggested that the hearing officer should only be permitted to reject filings that “materially” fail to comply with applicable requirements, so as not to elevate form over substance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has revised the Interim Final Rule to address this comment. Rejection of submissions merely because they fail to comply with this part in an immaterial fashion would be inconsistent with the Bureau's policy of encouraging fair and expeditious proceedings. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised § 1081.104(b)(6). The Final Rule provides that the hearing officer has the authority to “reject written submissions that materially fail to comply with the requirements of this part.” The Bureau adopts § 1081.104 of the Interim Final Rule with the changes discussed above.</analysisParagraph>

Section 556(b) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 556(b), provides that a hearing officer may disqualify himself or herself at any time. The standard for making a motion to disqualify requires that the movant have a reasonable, good faith basis for the motion.

Any person who is notified that a proceeding may or will be instituted against him or her, or any party to a proceeding, may make an offer of settlement in writing at any time.

Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) requires waiver of any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Director arising from the Director's consideration or discussions concerning settlement of all or any part of the proceeding.

The Bureau on its own initiative revised this section to make it consistent with § 1081.100 of this part regarding the scope of the Interim Final Rule. Section 1081.100 makes clear that the Interim Final Rule applies only to adjudication proceedings authorized by section 1053 of the Dodd-Frank Act and not to Bureau investigations, investigational hearings or other proceedings that do not arise from proceedings after the issuance of a notice of charges. As revised, this section governs only offers of settlement made after the institution of adjudication proceedings under this part. Under this section, any respondent in a proceeding may make an offer of settlement in writing at any time.

This commenter argued that allowing the hearing officer to limit the public nature of the proceeding in accordance with the standard set forth in § 1081.119 was problematic and advocated for the hearing officer to be permitted to establish time, place and manner limitations on the attendance of the public and the media for any public hearing.

The Bureau believes this is sufficient to provide the parties with an opportunity to adequately present expert testimony without unduly delaying the proceedings. Paragraph (b) also provides that no party may call an expert witness unless that witness has been identified and provided a report in accordance with this section, unless the hearing officer provides otherwise at a scheduling conference. The last clause is intended to reflect a hearing officer's discretion, at a scheduling conference, to dispense with or otherwise limit expert discovery in a particular case (as expressly provided for in paragraph (e) of this section).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) sets forth the required contents of an expert report. This section is based upon the corresponding provisions of the FTC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (d) provides for expert depositions, which are not to exceed 8 hours absent agreement of the parties or an order by the hearing officer. These time limits are intended to provide adequate time to prepare for expert testimony without unduly delaying the proceedings. Paragraph (d) also provides that expert depositions shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 1081.209. Finally, paragraph (d) provides that an expert's deposition shall be conducted after submission of the expert's report but no later than seven days prior to the deadline for submission of rebuttal expert reports. This provision is intended to allow parties to rely upon the deposition of an opposing party's expert in the preparation of a rebuttal expert report. Because, pursuant to paragraph (a), rebuttal reports are due 28 days after the exchange of expert reports, expert depositions will need to take place within that 28 day period.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (e) authorizes the hearing officer to dispense with expert discovery in appropriate cases. The Bureau envisions hearing officers relying on this provision in cease-and-desist proceedings brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Act, where the respondent has not requested a hearing date outside the statutory 30-to-60 day timeframe. In such cases, it may be appropriate to dispense with expert discovery for timing reasons, while allowing the parties to call expert witnesses.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.210 Expert Discovery</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule is modeled after the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31A. Neither the Uniform Rules nor the SEC Rules provide for expert discovery. The Bureau has provided for expert discovery in appropriate cases so that the parties may fully understand the other side's position prior to the hearing, which will enable a clearer and more efficient airing of the issues at the hearing, and which may also clarify the issues for a possible prehearing settlement. It will also enable the parties to identify rebuttal expert witnesses, if needed, prior to the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a) provides that the hearing officer shall establish a date for the exchange of expert reports in the scheduling order. This provision is intended to allow flexibility in scheduling expert discovery depending on the complexity of the case and the date of the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31A, paragraph (b) limits parties to five expert witnesses, including any rebuttal or surrebuttal experts, except in extraordinary circumstances.

Paragraph (b) also provides that no party may call an expert witness unless that witness has been identified and has provided a report in accordance with this section, unless the hearing officer provides otherwise at a scheduling conference.

      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (e) (paragraph (f) of the Final Rule) authorizes the hearing officer to dispense with expert discovery in appropriate cases. For example, the Bureau envisions hearing officers relying on this provision in cease-and-desist proceedings brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, where the respondent has not requested a hearing date outside the statutory 30-to-60 day timeframe. In such cases, it may be appropriate to dispense with expert discovery for timing reasons, while allowing the parties to call expert witnesses.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>After the Bureau promulgated the Interim Final Rule, the FTC amended its rule governing expert discovery. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 76 FR 52249 (Aug. 22, 2011). The FTC added a new paragraph to its expert discovery rule regarding materials that the parties cannot discover, including language nearly identical to language recently added to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(4)(B) and (C). The Bureau has similarly revised § 1081.210 to adopt these recent enhancements to the FTC Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau is therefore adding a new paragraph (e) to § 1081.210 and renumbering former paragraph (e) as paragraph (f). Under new paragraph (e), parties may not discover drafts of any report required by this section, regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded. In addition, the new language prohibits parties from discovering any communications, regardless of form, between another party's attorney and any of its expert witnesses, unless the communication: (1) Relates to the testifying expert's compensation for the study or testimony; (2) identifies facts or data provided by the party's attorney and considered by the testifying expert in forming the opinions to be expressed; or (3) identifies assumptions provided by the party's attorney and relied on by the testifying expert in forming the opinions to be expressed. The Bureau has also adopted the portion of the FTC Rules providing that a party may not discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specifically employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for the hearing and who is not listed as a witness for the hearing. The Bureau believes this section, which is consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(4)(D), appropriately limits the ability of parties to discover opinions held by experts who will not offer opinions at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on § 1081.210 of the Interim Final Rule, and with exception to the changes discussed above, adopts it without change in the Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.211 Interlocutory Review</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section sets forth the procedure and standards applicable to interlocutory review by the Director of a ruling or order of the hearing officer. In contrast to the practice in the federal judicial system, but like the SEC, the Director may take up a matter on his or her own motion at any time, even if a hearing officer does not certify it for interlocutory review.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) provides that any party may file a motion for certification of a ruling or order for interlocutory review within five days of service of the order or ruling. Responses to such motions are due within three days, and the hearing officer is required to rule upon such a motion within five days thereafter.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) sets forth the permissible bases for certifying a ruling or order. Certification is appropriate if the hearing officer's ruling would compel testimony or production of documents from Bureau officers or employees, or officers or employees from another governmental agency. This is consistent with the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.400. Like FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.23(a)(1), however, this provision includes officers and employees from other governmental agencies, and not just the Bureau, in order to afford the same treatment to other agencies within the federal government. Paragraph (c) also provides for certification of rulings or orders as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate review may materially advance the completion of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy. The hearing officer may also certify a ruling or order where the ruling or order involves a motion for disqualification of the hearing officer or the suspension of an individual from appearing before the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (d) provides that a party whose motion for certification is denied by the hearing officer may petition the Director directly for interlocutory review. This provision is intended to guard against a hearing officer's unwillingness to certify a ruling that appears to meet the standards set forth in the section. The Bureau expects such direct petitions to the Director to be used sparingly.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (e) governs the Director's review of matters certified pursuant to paragraph (c) or for which review is sought pursuant to paragraph (d).

      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (f) provides that proceedings will not be stayed by the filing of a motion for certification for interlocutory review or a grant of such review unless the hearing officer or the Director shall so order.

      <title>Section 1081.212 Dispositive Motions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section lays out the procedures and standards for motions to dismiss and motions for summary disposition. It expressly provides for the filing of motions to dismiss, but makes clear that filing such a motion does not affect a party's obligation to file an answer or take any other action. This is intended to ensure that motions to dismiss do not delay the proceedings unnecessarily. The timelines for decisions on dispositive motions, discussed below, should help ensure that a party ultimately determined to be entitled to dismissal is not required to engage in the adjudicative process for a lengthy period of time.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) provides that a respondent may file a motion to dismiss asserting that, even assuming the truth of the facts alleged in the notice of charges, it is entitled to dismissal as a matter of law. Neither the SEC Rules, the FTC Rules, nor the Uniform Rules specifically set forth procedures or a standard applicable to motions to dismiss, although the FTC Rules and Uniform Rules appear to contemplate such motions. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 16 CFR 3.22(a) (referencing motions to dismiss); 12 CFR 19.5(b)(7) (same). The Bureau has determined that such motions are appropriate and should be provided for in the Rules, but should not serve to delay the proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (c) and (d) govern the filing of motions for summary disposition. They adopt standards similar to those set forth in the Uniform Rules, the SEC Rules, and the FTC Rules for such motions. Any party to a proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition of a proceeding or for partial summary disposition of a proceeding if: (1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and (2) the moving party is entitled to a favorable decision as a matter of law. The motion, which may be filed after a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available for inspection and copying pursuant to § 1081.206, must be accompanied by a statement of the uncontested material facts, a brief, and any documentary evidence in support of the motion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Any party opposing such a motion must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists, supported by the same type of evidence permitted with a motion for summary disposition, and a brief in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate. These paragraphs are modeled after the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.29.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g), motions to dismiss and for summary disposition are subject to a 35-page limit (modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.250(c)), responses to such motions are due within 20 days (modeled on the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.29(b)(1)), and reply briefs are due within five days of the response and shall not exceed 10 pages. Oral argument is permitted at the request of any party or by motion of the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) provides that the hearing officer must decide a dispositive motion within 30 days of the expiration of the time for filing all oppositions and replies. The Uniform Rules do not set a deadline for a decision on dispositive motions. The FTC Rules provide for the Commission to decide substantive motions within 45 days, 16 CFR 3.22(a), and the SEC Rules state that motions for summary disposition are to be decided “promptly” by the hearing officer, 17 CFR 201.250(b). The Bureau has adopted the 30-day timeframe for decisions on dispositive motions in keeping with its emphasis on expeditious decision-making in administrative proceedings. The Bureau believes that 30 days affords sufficient time for the hearing officer to properly assess the merits of the motion and draft either a ruling denying the motion or a recommended decision granting it.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>If the hearing officer finds that a party is not entitled to dismissal or summary disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying that motion. This ruling would not be subject to interlocutory appeal unless such an appeal was granted pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in § 1081.211. If the hearing officer determines that dismissal or summary adjudication is appropriate, he or she will issue a recommended decision to that effect. If a party, for good cause shown, cannot yet present facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer is to deny or defer the motion.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule, based upon the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.210, allows for amicus briefs in proceedings under this part, but only under certain circumstances. Specifically, under paragraph (a) of this section, an amicus brief may be allowed when a motion for leave to file the brief has been granted; the brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties; the brief is filed at the request of the Director or the hearing officer, as appropriate; or the brief is presented by the United States or an officer or agency thereof, or by a State, or a political subdivision thereof.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter expressed concern that the authorization for governmental agencies to file amicus briefs without receiving prior permission will result in the filing of numerous amicus briefs. The Bureau believes that amicus briefs from governmental entities are likely to make a valuable contribution to the adjudicative process, and are unlikely to become overwhelming or detrimental. The Bureau will consider revisiting this section if this belief proves incorrect, but the Final Rule adopts paragraph (a) of the Interim Final Rule without change.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A motion to file an amicus brief is subject to the procedural requirements set forth in § 1081.205. An amicus will be granted oral argument only for extraordinary reasons. In order to provide additional guidance to parties seeking to file amicus briefs, § 1081.216(d) provides that amicus briefs shall be filed pursuant to § 1081.111 and shall comply with the requirements of § 1081.112. Amicus briefs shall also be subject to the length limitations set forth in § 1081.212(e). The Bureau received no comments regarding the rest of § 1081.216 of the Interim Final Rule, and adopts the remaining paragraphs without change in the Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.119 Confidential Information; Protective Orders</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section sets forth the means by which a party or another person may seek a protective order shielding confidential information. While generally modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.322, the section adopts the substantive standard set forth in the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.45(b), which provides that the hearing officer may grant a protective order only upon a finding that public disclosure will likely result in a clearly defined, serious injury to the person requesting confidential treatment or after finding that the material constitutes sensitive personal information. The Rule adopts the FTC's standard because it comports with the Bureau's goals of providing as much transparency in the adjudicative process as possible, while also protecting confidential business information or other sensitive information of parties appearing before the Bureau or third parties whose information may be introduced into evidence. The Bureau expects that the standard set forth in this section will be met in cases where the disclosure of trade secrets or other information to the public or to parties is likely to result in harm, but that the standard will not be met simply because the information at issue is deemed “confidential” or “proprietary” by the movant. To the extent that a movant can identify a clearly defined, serious injury likely to result from the disclosure of such particular information, it will be protected; generalized claims of competitive or other injury generally will not suffice. This section provides that documents subject to a motion for confidential treatment will be maintained under seal until the motion is decided.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule sets forth the means by which a party or another person may seek a protective order shielding confidential information.

This section provides that documents subject to a motion for confidential treatment will be maintained under seal until the motion is decided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter expressed concern that the Interim Final Rule may not accommodate a situation where the person seeking confidential treatment is not the same as the person who would be harmed by the disclosure of the material. In order to clarify the rights of third parties whose confidential information may be disclosed during the adjudicative process, the Bureau added a new paragraph (a), providing that a party may not disclose confidential information obtained from a third party without providing the third party at least ten days notice prior to the disclosure. In response to this notice, the third party has the option to consent to the disclosure of such information, which may be conditioned on the entry of a protective order, or may intervene in the proceeding for the limited purpose of moving for a protective order pursuant to this section. The new paragraph (a) further provides that a party must certify that proper notice was provided for any written filing or oral motion or argument that contains confidential information obtained from a third party.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In order to streamline the process for disclosing confidential information obtained from third parties, the Bureau revised paragraph (b) of the Interim Final Rule (paragraph (c) of the Final Rule) to provide for the mandatory entry of a stipulated protective order that has been agreed to by all parties, including third parties to the extent their information is at issue. However, the Office of Enforcement reserves the right to refuse to stipulate to a protective order that does not meet the substantive standards set forth in this section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter recommended that the Bureau adopt the SEC's standard for granting a protective order and revise paragraph (b) of the Interim Final Rule to provide that a “motion for a protective order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the Bureau considered the SEC's standard, but ultimately decided to adopt the FTC's standard because it comports with the Bureau's goals of providing transparency in the adjudicative process while also protecting confidential business information or other sensitive information. The Bureau believes the standard it adopts in this section serves the public interest by balancing the need for a public understanding of the Bureau's adjudication proceedings with the interests of respondents in avoiding competitive injury from public disclosure of information. <em data-original="E-03">See In re Gen. Foods Corp.,</em> 95 F.T.C. 352 (1980).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The commenter raised a number of specific concerns regarding the Bureau's adoption of the FTC's standard. First, the commenter stated that the standard prevents a financial institution from seeking confidential treatment of its customers' personal information. However, the Interim Final Rule provides that a protective order shall be issued after finding that the material constitutes sensitive personal information. There is no prohibition on persons seeking confidential treatment of sensitive personal information of other persons. On the contrary, the Bureau contemplates that the sensitive personal information of consumers will regularly be protected under §§ 1081.112(e) and 1081.119(b), whether because of a motion for a protective order filed by a person other than the consumer or stipulated to by the parties, or because of the requirement that sensitive personal information generally be redacted under § 1081.112(e).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The commenter also objected to this standard because it does not define the terms “serious injury,” “likely,” or “clearly defined.” The commenter identified the unpredictable possibility of identity theft as a possibility of injury that may not be “likely.” The Bureau believes that the commenter's concerns regarding potential identity theft should be addressed by § 1081.112(e), which generally requires the redaction of sensitive personal information. The Bureau reiterates that it anticipates that sensitive personal information of consumers will regularly be protected from public disclosure. The Bureau again notes that § 1081.112(e) is based on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.45(b), and that the FTC has significant experience applying these standards in many types of cases. The Bureau believes leaving these terms undefined provides the hearing officer with the necessary flexibility to address confidentiality concerns on a case-by-case basis based on the relevant facts and circumstances. At the same time, this standard is consistent with the Bureau's goal of transparency and avoids granting confidential status based on unsupported and generalized claims of competitive or other injury.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The commenter also stated that the Interim Final Rule does not accommodate the possibility that the public disclosure of information may be illegal under laws unrelated to the adjudication proceeding. The Bureau agrees and has therefore revised paragraph (b) of this section (now paragraph (c)) to break up the bases for issuance of protective orders into subsections and to include a new subsection making clear that the hearing officer shall grant a protective order where public disclosure is prohibited by law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, consistent with the Bureau's commitment to transparency and open government, the Bureau clarified paragraph (b) of the Interim Rule (paragraph (c) of the Final Rule) to recognize that documents and testimony filed in connection with an adjudication proceeding are presumed to be public. This clarification is consistent with § 1081.300 and the revised § 1081.111(c), both of which recognize a presumption that documents, testimony, and hearings are public.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that the Bureau remove the requirement in paragraph (e) that sensitive personal information be redacted from filings. The commenter believed that this requirement was not workable because the Interim Final Rule did not define “sensitive personal information” and only provided examples of such information. The commenter also pointed out that the Uniform Rules and the SEC Rules do not require the redaction of sensitive personal information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to omit the requirement that sensitive personal information be redacted from filings. The Bureau continues to believe that it is improper to file Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, and other sensitive personal information in an adjudication proceeding where the information is not relevant or otherwise necessary for the conduct of the proceeding. The Bureau notes that this section is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.45(b), and is also similar to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2, which require filers to redact certain personal information, including Social Security numbers and financial account numbers, from filings. The Bureau agrees, however, that the term “sensitive personal information” should be defined and has therefore revised paragraph (e) to define that term.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The commenter also recommended the removal of paragraph (f)(2), which requires a party seeking confidential treatment of information in a filing to file an expurgated copy of the filing with the allegedly confidential material redacted. Specifically, the commenter stated that paragraph (f)(2)'s requirement that the redacted version show the size and location of the redactions could, in effect, disclose what was redacted and may be impractical when redactions are made electronically. The commenter stated that the SEC Rules and Uniform Rules do not include this requirement. The Bureau notes that paragraph (f)(2) is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.45(e), and that the commenter did not identify how this redaction requirement could disclose confidential information or would be impractical. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to omit this requirement.</analysisParagraph>

It specifies the papers that must be filed and addresses the time and manner of filing. The Bureau received no comments regarding this section. In the interest of clarity and to provide further guidance to parties, however, the Bureau has amended the Interim Final Rule in several respects.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, the Final Rule makes technical revisions to paragraph (a) to require the filing of the disclosure statement and notification of financial interest required under the new § 1081.201(e). The Final Rule also includes a slight revision to paragraph (a) intended to clarify that the Bureau must file the proof of service of the notice of charges. Among other things, the filing of the proof of service will provide notice of the beginning of the ten-day period after which the Bureau will publish the notice of charges under § 1081.200(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Final Rule makes non-substantive changes to paragraph (b) of the Interim Final Rule to make uniform the references to the United States Postal Service and the different mail services. The Bureau also revised paragraph (b) to reflect the transfer of certain authorities to the newly-created Office of Administrative Adjudication. As a result, the section provides for filing by electronic transmission upon the conditions specified by the Office of Administrative Adjudication, recognizing that while the Bureau anticipates the development of an electronic filing system, it may adopt other means of electronic filing in the interim (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> email transmission). The section authorizes other methods of filing if a respondent demonstrates, in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Administrative Adjudication, that filing via electronic transmission is not practical.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau added a new paragraph (c), providing that unless otherwise ordered by the Bureau or the hearing officer, or in the absence of a pending motion seeking such an order, all papers filed in connection with an adjudication proceeding are presumed to be open to the public. This paragraph is consistent with the Bureau's commitment to making adjudication proceedings as transparent as reasonably possible, as reflected in §§ 1081.119(c) and 1081.300, which both recognize a presumption that documents and testimony in adjudication hearings are public.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments regarding this section. One commenter expressed the concern that it may be difficult to determine whether a notice of charges “will be” or is “likely to be” issued for the purpose of determining when the prohibition on ex parte communications begins. The commentator stated that, because an individual makes the final decision to issue a notice of charges and the individual's thinking could change unexpectedly, anything short of respondent's actual knowledge that a notice of charges has actually been issued should be insufficient to begin the prohibition on ex parte communications. The commentator stated that it would not be appropriate to sanction someone for an ex parte communication when the person does not know whether a notice of charges has been issued. The commenter proposed that the Bureau revise this section of the Interim Final Rule to begin the ban on ex parte communications upon notice of actual issuance and service of a notice of charges, regardless of whether the person has knowledge that a notice of charges will be issued. Similarly, in cases in which a court has vacated a final decision and order and remanded a matter for further adjudication proceedings, the commenter proposed that this section of the Interim Final Rule be revised to prohibit ex parte communications after remand beginning when the party actually knows the Bureau will not file an appeal because the time for filing an appeal has lapsed and the party has not been served with a notice of appeal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has revised the section after considering these comments. The APA provides that the prohibition on ex parte communications “shall apply beginning at such time as the agency may designate, but in no case shall they begin to apply later than the time at which a proceeding is noticed for hearing unless the person responsible for the communication has knowledge that it will be noticed, in which case the prohibitions shall apply beginning at the time of his acquisition of such knowledge.” 5 U.S.C. 557(d)(1)(E). The APA does not, however, prohibit ex parte communications from the time a party knows a proceeding “is likely to be” issued. Accordingly, the Bureau has struck the phrase “is likely to be” from § 1081.110(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also revised § 1081.110(a)(3) with respect to the timing of the respondent's knowledge of whether the Bureau will file an appeal. The Final Rule removes that provision of the Interim Final Rule stating that “an order of remand by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed to become effective when the Bureau determines not to file an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari,” and slightly revises the rest of the section to reflect the fact that review of an appellate court's decision may only be had upon the grant of a petition for rehearing by the panel or an en banc panel, or the grant of a petition for a writ of certiorari. This amendment responds to the commenter's concern that a respondent will not know whether the Bureau intends to appeal until the Bureau provides notice of its intention.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (e) provides that Bureau employees engaged in an investigational or prosecutorial function, other than the Director, may not participate in the decision-making function in the same or a factually related matter. The commenter expressed concern that this section would permit the Director to engage in ex parte communications with Bureau enforcement counsel regarding the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended decision in the same or factually related case. The commenter therefore recommended that this section be revised to prohibit enforcement counsel from communicating with the Director under these circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, while this section of the Interim Final Rule does not bar enforcement counsel from communicating with the Director regarding matters unrelated to the Director's adjudicatory functions, this section expressly prohibits enforcement counsel from participating or advising in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended decision, except as witness or counsel in a public proceeding. The Bureau believes that these prohibitions are consistent with the separation of functions provision of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 554(d), and address the commenter's concern. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to revise paragraph (e).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This comment arguably should have been directed to the Rules of Investigation, 12 CFR part 1080, but the Bureau addresses it here.

Rather, it states that nothing within “this part” (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the Interim Final Rule) should be construed as limiting the Bureau's supervisory, investigatory, or other authority to gather information in accordance with law. The Bureau does not agree with the commenter's interpretation of section 1052(c)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act, but notes that any limitations placed upon it by that section are incorporated in 12 CFR 1080.6, which provides that civil investigative demands will be issued in accordance with section 1052(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the policy reflected in paragraph (b) ensures fairness to both the parties and the hearing officer by allowing an administrative matter to proceed within the timeframes provided by the Interim Final Rule, which were designed to provide sufficient time to both the litigants and the hearing officer.

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the SEC amended its rules in 2003 to improve the timeliness of its administrative proceedings.

             and consulted with the prudential regulators, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, including with respect to whether the Rules are consistent with any relevant prudential, market, and systemic objectives administered by such agencies.<footnote ref="4">The President's July 11, 2011, Executive Order 13579 entitled “Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies,” asks the independent agencies to follow the cost-saving, burden-reducing principles in Executive Order 13563; harmonization and simplification of rules; flexible approaches that reduce costs; and scientific integrity. In the spirit of Executive Order 13563, the CFPB has consulted with the Office of Management and Budget regarding this interim final rule.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concludes that the Rules will benefit consumers and covered persons alike. The Rules do not impose any obligations on consumers or covered persons, nor do they have any direct relevance to consumers' access to consumer financial products and services. Rather, they provide a clear, efficient mechanism for the conduct of adjudication proceedings, which benefits consumers because the Rules offer a systematic process for protecting them from unlawful behavior. The Rules are intended to provide an expeditious decision-making process, which will benefit both consumers and covered persons. The Rules adopt an affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery, pursuant to which the Bureau will make available to respondents the information obtained by the Division of Enforcement from persons not employed by the Bureau prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. This affirmative disclosure obligation substitutes for the traditional civil discovery process, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. The Bureau believes that the Rules, on the whole, will afford covered persons with a relatively inexpensive way to have their cases heard. The Rules are based upon, and drawn from, existing rules of the prudential regulators, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Their grounding in rules likely familiar to practitioners should further reduce the expense of administrative adjudication for covered persons.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Further, the Rules have no unique impact on insured depository institutions or insured credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets described in section 1026(a) of the Act, and do not have a unique impact on rural consumers.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section adopts the general framework governing decisions by the hearing officer from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360. It provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case within a specified time frame. Unlike the SEC Rule, which provides that the hearing officer will issue an “initial decision,” this section provides that the hearing officer's decision will be a recommended decision to the Director.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also deviates from the SEC model in that it does not provide for multiple “tracks” or timelines, but just one. This section provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case no later than 90 days after the deadline for filing post-hearing responsive briefs and in no event later than 300 days after service of the notice of charges. The 300-day timeframe is taken from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360(a)(2), and the 90-day timeframe is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.51(a).

As noted above, this provision was adopted to ensure the timely resolution of adjudication proceedings in light of the experience of other agencies.

The recommended decision shall also state that a notice of appeal may be filed within 10 days after service of the recommended decision, and shall include a statement that the Director may issue a final decision and order adopting the recommended decision, unless a party timely files and perfects a notice of appeal.

      <title>Section 1081.400 Recommended Decision of the Hearing Officer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section of the Interim Final Rule adopts the general framework of the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360, governing decisions by the hearing officer. Section 1081.400 provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case within a specified time frame. Unlike the SEC Rules, which provide that the hearing officer will issue an “initial decision,” this section provides that the hearing officer's decision will be a “recommended decision” to the Director.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also deviates from the analogous SEC Rules in that it provides for only one timeline, rather than multiple “tracks” or timelines. Paragraph (a) of this section provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case no later than 90 days after the deadline for filing post-hearing responsive briefs and in no event later than 300 days after service of the notice of charges. The 300-day timeframe is taken from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360(a)(2), and the 90-day timeframe is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.51(a).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.402 Notice of Appeal; Review by the Director</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section contains the process for review of a recommended decision by the Director. Paragraph (a) is drawn from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.52(b), and states that any party may object to the recommended decision of the hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal to the Director within 10 days of the recommended decision and perfecting that notice of appeal by filing an opening brief within 30 days of the recommended decision. Any party may respond to the opening brief by filing an answering brief within 30 days of service of the opening brief, and reply briefs may be filed within seven days after that. Appeals to the Director are available as of right in all cases where the hearing officer has issued a recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also provides that within 40 days after the date of service of the recommended decision, the Director, on his or her own initiative, may order further briefing or argument with respect to any recommended decision or portion of any recommended decision or issue a final decision and order adopting the recommended decision. The 40-day time period is intended to provide the Director with the benefit of knowing whether any party has filed and perfected an appeal before determining whether further briefing and argument regarding a recommended decision is necessary. Any such order shall set forth the scope of further review and the issues that will be considered and will provide for the filing of briefs if the Director deems briefing appropriate.</analysisParagraph>

Appeals to the Director are available as of right in all cases where the hearing officer has issued a recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A commenter noted that the ten-day deadline by which a party must file a notice of appeal is shorter than the 30-day deadline required by the prudential regulators, and urged the Bureau to extend its deadline to 30 days. The Bureau has considered this suggestion but has decided to keep the ten-day deadline. The burden on a party to file a proper notice of appeal is minimal. A party need only specify the party or parties against whom the appeal is taken, and designate the recommended decision or part thereof appealed from. The ten-day timeline provides adequate time to make these initial determinations. The more comprehensive document in the appeals process, the opening brief, is not due until 30 days from the service of the recommended decision. Moreover, an extension of the deadline for a notice of appeal would require extension of other deadlines in the appeal process, such as the Director's review in the absence of a notice of appeal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also provides that within 40 days after the date of service of the recommended decision, the Director, on his or her own initiative, may order further briefing or argument with respect to any recommended decision or portion of any recommended decision or may issue a final decision and order adopting the recommended decision. The 40-day time period is intended to provide the Director with the benefit of knowing whether any party has filed and perfected an appeal before determining whether further briefing and argument regarding a recommended decision is necessary.

However, where it appears to the hearing officer that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show further the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the hearing officer determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination, the hearing officer may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be proved.</content>
