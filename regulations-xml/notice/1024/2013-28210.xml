Lines 204-209 should be used to indicate any financing arrangements or other new loan not listed in Line 202.

Lines 204-209 should also be used where the Borrower receives a credit from the Seller for closing costs, including seller-paid GFE charges. They may also be used in cases in which a Seller (typically a builder) is making an “allowance” to the Borrower for items that the Borrower is to purchase separately. For reverse mortgages, the amount of any initial draw at settlement is disclosed on Line 204.</content>

        <title>Appendix A—Instructions for Completing HUD-1 and HUD-1 A Settlement Statements; Sample HUD-1 and HUD-1A Statements</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to require creditors to use the integrated Closing Disclosure required by §§ 1026.19(f) and 1026.38 to satisfy the disclosure requirements under RESPA section 4 for closed-end transactions covered by RESPA, except for reverse mortgage transactions. The Bureau recognized in the proposed rule that the manner in which reverse mortgage transactions are disclosed on the RESPA settlement statement (the HUD-1 or HUD-1A) under appendix A to Regulation X is a source of confusion for creditors and settlement agents. HUD attempted to clarify the use of the RESPA settlement statement in reverse mortgage transactions by issuing frequently-asked questions, the HUD RESPA FAQs, the most recent of which was released on April 2, 2010. The Bureau proposed to exercise its authority under RESPA section 19(a) to modify appendix A to Regulation X to incorporate the guidance provided by the HUD RESPA FAQs regarding reverse mortgage loans because, under the proposed rule, the closing of reverse mortgage transactions would have continued to be disclosed using the RESPA settlement statement. The proposed revisions would have been located in the instructions for lines 202, 204, and page 3, loan terms.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that incorporating this guidance into appendix A to Regulation X would have improved the effectiveness of the disclosures when used for reverse mortgages, thereby reducing industry confusion and advancing the purpose of RESPA to provide more effective advanced disclosure of settlement costs to both the borrower and the seller in the real estate transaction, consistent with RESPA section 19(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter supported the revisions related to proposed appendix A to Regulation X, but requested that compliance with the modifications be considered optional.

        <title>Appendix B—Illustrations of Requirements of RESPA</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Illustration 12 in appendix B to part 1024 provides a factual situation where a mortgage broker provides origination services to submit a loan to a lender for approval. The mortgage broker charges the borrower a uniform fee for the total origination services, as well as a direct up-front charge for reimbursement of credit reporting, appraisal services, or similar charges. To address this factual situation, illustration 12 provides a comment explaining that the mortgage broker's fee must be itemized in the RESPA GFE and on the RESPA settlement statement; other charges that are paid for by the borrower and paid in advance of consummation are listed as paid outside closing on the RESPA settlement statement and reflect the actual provider charge for such services; and any other fee or payment received by the mortgage broker from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread premium, is to be noted on the RESPA GFE and listed in the 800 series of the RESPA settlement statement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Subsequent to the guidance provided in illustration 12, Regulation Z § 1026.36(d)(2) was adopted. Section 1026.36(d)(2) states:</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>If any loan originator receives compensation directly from a consumer in a consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling: (i) No loan originator shall receive compensation, directly or indirectly, from any person other than the consumer in connection with the transaction; and (ii) No person who knows or has reason to know of the consumer-paid compensation to the loan originator (other than the consumer) shall pay any compensation to a loan originator, directly or indirectly, in connection with the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The last sentence in illustration 12 clearly contemplates the loan originator, a mortgage broker, receiving compensation from the lender as well as the borrower, which therefore describes a factual situation prohibited by § 1026.36(d)(2). Accordingly, for consistency with § 1026.36(d)(2), the Bureau proposed to exercise its authority under RESPA section 19(a) to delete the last sentence of the comment provided in illustration 12 in appendix B to Regulation X.</analysisParagraph>

The proposed rule did not include any substantive modification to the delivery requirements of Regulation X. In addition, given the nature of a reverse mortgage transaction and the potential loss of a residence due to a termination event, the Bureau believes more analysis must be conducted, as stated above, before any modification of the disclosure requirements for reverse mortgages is proposed.

            <title>5(a) Applicability</title>
            <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed below under § 1024.5(d), the Bureau proposed to use its authority under RESPA section 19(a) and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to exempt certain transactions from the existing RESPA GFE and RESPA settlement statement requirements of Regulation X. The Bureau, therefore, proposed a conforming amendment to § 1024.5(a) to reflect these partial exemptions pursuant to the same authority. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed revisions to § 1024.5(a) and is therefore adopting the revisions to § 1024.5(a) as proposed, with a modification to reflect that proposed § 1024.5(c) is being adopted as § 1024.5(d), as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
          </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection target="1024-5-b-1" notice="2013-28210" date="2013-12-31">
            <title>5(b)(1)</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.5(b)(1) currently exempts from the coverage of RESPA and Regulation X loans on property of 25 acres or more. The Bureau proposed to exercise its authority under RESPA section 19(a) and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to eliminate this Regulation X exemption to render the TILA and RESPA regimes more consistent. The Bureau believed that most loans that fall into this category are separately exempt under a provision excluding extensions of credit primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes, set forth in § 1024.5(b)(2). In addition, the Bureau believed that this consistency would have improved consumer awareness and understanding of transactions involving residential mortgage loans and, therefore, would have been in the interest of consumers and the public, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b). Because it was unclear to the Bureau whether any mortgage loans are exempt based solely on § 1024.5(b)(1), the Bureau solicited comment on the number of loans that may be affected by this aspect of the proposal and any reasons for the continued exemption of loans on property of 25 acres or more.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One non-depository rural lender commenter stated that the exemption for loans on property of 25 acres or more should be retained because approximately 55 percent of its consumer purpose loans did not require a RESPA GFE and 61 percent of its closed-end consumer-purpose loans secured by real property did not require a RESPA settlement statement under this exemption. The commenter gave several examples of consumer purposes for these types of loans, such as loans financing the transfer of property interests pursuant to divorce settlements, cash-out refinancing for nursing home expenses for the borrowers themselves or their parents, and financing the purchase of second homes. Other commenters generally did not express opposition to the proposed elimination of the 25-acres-or-more exemption, but rather requested that the final rule reiterate that the test for coverage for the integrated disclosures should be whether the primary purpose of the loan is for consumer purposes. One industry State trade association stated that consumer purpose loans are structured the same whether secured by 24 or 25 acres or more and have similar costs, and therefore, their members generally do not object to providing the integrated disclosures to all consumer purpose loans secured by real property, regardless of property size. A title insurance company commenter agreed with the Bureau that there is no reason to retain the 25-acres-or-more exemption because most of those loans would also be exempt under the exemption for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Generally, TILA has longstanding requirements for disclosures to be provided in connection with loans secured by real property. Dodd-Frank Act sections 1032(f), 1098, and 1100A directed the integration of the TILA and RESPA forms, implicitly authorizing the Bureau to harmonize statutory differences, as discussed above. The Bureau believes that consumers of closed-end credit transactions secured by real property of 25 acres or more should obtain the integrated disclosures provided pursuant to § 1026.19 below. In addition, Congress in section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service are fully, accurately and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service. 12 U.S.C. 5532(a). The Bureau believes that consumers of consumer-purpose loans secured by property of 25 acres or more should obtain the integrated disclosures, as they would be just as useful to such consumers as to consumers of loans secured by smaller areas of real property. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> section-by-section analysis of § 1026.19 in general, below. The Bureau believes such disclosure is consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau therefore exercises its authority under Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), RESPA section 19(a) and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to eliminate the exemption for loans secured by property of 25 acres or more in § 1024.5(b)(1) of Regulation X. This amendment will render the TILA and RESPA regimes more consistent, which promotes more effective advance disclosure of settlement costs (which is a purpose of RESPA). In addition, this consistency will improve consumer awareness and understanding of transactions involving residential mortgage loans and is therefore in the interest of consumers and the public, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>5(d) Partial Exemptions for Certain Mortgage Loans</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.5(c) to exempt creditors from certain RESPA requirements for loans subject to the integrated disclosure requirements and also certain federally related mortgage loans that satisfy specified criteria associated with certain housing assistance loan programs for low- and moderate-income persons. Specifically, creditors would be exempt from the requirement to provide the RESPA settlement cost booklet, RESPA GFE, RESPA settlement statement, and application servicing disclosure statement requirements of §§ 1024.6, 1024.7, 1024.8, 1024.10, and 1024.21(b) and (c). The Bureau proposed this exemption under RESPA section 19(a), Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a) and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b). This proposed exemption would have cross-referenced proposed § 1026.3(h), which codifies an exemption issued by HUD on October 6, 2010. Under the HUD exemption, lenders need not provide the RESPA GFE and RESPA settlement statement when six prerequisites are satisfied: (1) The loan is secured by a subordinate lien; (2) the loan's purpose is to finance downpayment, closing costs, or similar homebuyer assistance, such as principal or interest subsidies, property rehabilitation assistance, energy efficiency assistance, or foreclosure avoidance or prevention; (3) interest is not charged on the loan; (4) repayment of the loan is forgiven or deferred subject to specified conditions; (5) total settlement costs do not exceed one percent of the loan amount and are limited to fees for recordation, application, and housing counseling; and (6) the loan recipient is provided at or before settlement with a written disclosure of the loan terms, repayment conditions, and costs of the loan.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>To facilitate compliance, the Bureau proposed to codify this exemption in Regulations X and Z for the same reasons and under the same authority as cited by HUD. Specifically, HUD invoked its authority under RESPA section 19(a) to grant “reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions, as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of [RESPA].” HUD determined that, for transactions meeting the criteria listed above, the RESPA GFE and RESPA settlement statement forms would be difficult to complete in a meaningful way and likely would confuse consumers who received them. Moreover, because of the limited, fixed fees involved with such transactions, the comparison shopping purpose of the RESPA GFE would not be achieved. Finally, the alternative written disclosure required as a prerequisite of the exemption would ensure that consumers understand the loan terms and settlement costs charged.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau proposed this exemption based on its authority under Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) because the Bureau believed the proposed exemption would improve consumer awareness and understanding of residential mortgage loan transactions of the type discussed above and therefore would be in the interest of consumers and the public. These exemptions would have created consistency with the proposed integrated disclosure requirements under Regulation Z and codified a disclosure exemption previously granted by HUD. However, the exemptions would have retained coverage of affected loans for all other requirements of Regulation X, such as provisions implementing the servicing requirements in RESPA section 6 (other than the application servicing disclosure statement), prohibitions on referral fees and kickbacks in RESPA section 8, and limits on amounts to be deposited in escrow accounts in RESPA section 10.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 1024.5(c). However, the Bureau adopted a regulation on July 10, 2013 that added § 1024.5(c) concerning RESPA's relation to State laws. 78 FR 44686 (July 24, 2013).<footnote ref="158">The regulation recodified the provisions of § 1024.13 as § 1024.5(c) in order to clarify the application of State law provisions concerning the servicing of mortgage loans in the context of RESPA. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 78 FR 44686, 44689-90 (July 24, 2013).</footnote>

            <title>33(a) Servicing Disclosure Statement</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the Bureau's 2012 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Proposal, the Bureau proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions to conform § 1024.33(a) to the comprehensive amendments to consumer mortgage disclosures proposed by the Bureau in the TILA-RESPA Proposal. Because the Bureau intended to incorporate the servicing disclosure statement requirements of RESPA section 6(a) into the consolidated disclosure forms for the TILA-RESPA Proposal, the Bureau had proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement provisions in new § 1024.33 to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions because those transactions would not be covered by the TILA-RESPA Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>After additional consideration, because the TILA-RESPA Proposal would not be finalized until after the 2013 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule became effective, in the 2013 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule the Bureau decided not to finalize the language in proposed § 1024.33(a) that would have limited the scope of the provision to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. Instead, the Bureau finalized § 1024.33(a) by conforming the scope to “mortgage loans” other than subordinate-lien mortgage loans, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(c) of the 2013 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule. Accordingly, in the 2013 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau added language to § 1024.33(a) so that applicants for “first-lien mortgage loans” must receive the servicing disclosure statement, as indicated at § 1024.30(c)(1). Thus, applicants for both reverse and forward mortgage loans must receive currently the servicing disclosure statement under Regulation X.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau has incorporated the servicing disclosure statement under RESPA section 6(a) into the Loan Estimate, as described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(m) below, the Bureau is adopting in this final rule an amendment to § 1024.33(a), which limits the requirement to provide the servicing disclosure statement to reverse mortgage transactions. The Bureau intends this amendment to reflect the requirement that the Loan Estimate include the servicing disclosure statement under § 1026.37(m)(6) for transactions subject to § 1026.19(e), thereby eliminating a duplicative disclosure requirement.</analysisParagraph>

              The Bureau proposed to require creditors to use the integrated Closing Disclosure required by §§ 1026.19(f) and 1026.38 to satisfy the disclosure requirements under RESPA section 4 for closed-end transactions covered by RESPA, except for reverse mortgage transactions. The Bureau recognized in the proposed rule that the manner in which reverse mortgage transactions are disclosed on the RESPA settlement statement (the HUD-1 or HUD-1A) under appendix A to Regulation X is a source of confusion for creditors and settlement agents. HUD attempted to clarify the use of the RESPA settlement statement in reverse mortgage transactions by issuing frequently-asked questions, the HUD RESPA FAQs, the most recent of which was released on April 2, 2010. The Bureau proposed to exercise its authority under RESPA section 19(a) to modify appendix A to Regulation X to incorporate the guidance provided by the HUD RESPA FAQs regarding reverse mortgage loans because, under the proposed rule, the closing of reverse mortgage transactions would have continued to be disclosed using the RESPA settlement statement.

            </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>
              The Bureau believed that incorporating this guidance into appendix A to Regulation X would have improved the effectiveness of the disclosures when used for reverse mortgages, thereby reducing industry confusion and advancing the purpose of RESPA to provide more effective advanced disclosure of settlement costs to both the borrower and the seller in the real estate transaction, consistent with RESPA section 19(a).
