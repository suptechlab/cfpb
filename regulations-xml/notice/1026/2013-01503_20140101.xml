              <content>Records are sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> if they demonstrate the following facts: The nature and amount of the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>; that the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> was paid, and by whom; that the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> was received, and by whom; and when the payment and receipt of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> occurred. The <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref> themselves are to be retained in all circumstances consistent with § <ref target="1026-25-c-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.25(c)(2)(i)</ref>. The additional records that are sufficient necessarily will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts and circumstances, particularly with regard to the nature of the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the form of a salary, records to be retained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code that demonstrate the amount of the salary. If the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the form of a contribution to or a benefit under a designated tax-advantaged retirement plan, records to be maintained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), <ref target="USC:29-1001" reftype="external">29 U.S.C. 1001</ref> et seq., relating to the plans, copies of the plan and amendments thereto in which <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> participate and the names of any <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originators</ref> covered by such plans, or determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service regarding such plans. If the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the nature of a commission or bonus, records to be retained might include a settlement agent “flow of funds” worksheet or other written record or a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> closing instructions letter directing disbursement of fees at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. Where a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> or broker <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> required by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> law that recites the broker's total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for a transaction is a record of the amount actually paid to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> in connection with the transaction, unless actual <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> deviates from the amount in the disclosure or <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref>. Where <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> has been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting the decrease in <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> and reasons for it.</content>

Accordingly, a table-funded transaction is consummated with the debt obligation initially payable by its terms to one <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, but another <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> provides the funds for the transaction at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other evidence of the debt obligation. Although § <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(17)</ref>(i)(B) provides that a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> to whom a debt obligation is initially payable on its face generally is a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-36-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)(1)</ref> provides that, solely for th<ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">e purpo</ref>ses of § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>, such a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> is also considered a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> closes a transaction in its own name but does not fund the transaction from its own resources and assigns the transaction after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> providing the funds, it is considered a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for purposes of Regulation Z and also a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>. However, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> closes in its own name and finances a consumer credit transaction from the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s own resources, including drawing on a bona fide warehouse line of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> or out of deposits held by the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, and does not assign the loan at closing, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> is a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> not making use of table funding but is included in the definition of <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> for the purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-f" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-g" reftype="internal">(g)</ref> concerning <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> qualifications.</content></interpParagraph>

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may not award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> based on the terms of a consumer credit transaction subject to § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref> originated by that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, bona fide returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including those paid to owners or shareholders of a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> who own such stock or equity interests, are not <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. Bona fide returns or dividends are those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent to <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s respective capital contribution where the allocation is not a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on terms of a transaction. Ownership and equity interests also are not bona fide if the formation or maintenance of the business from which returns or dividends are paid is a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of a transaction. For example, assume that three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> form a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> that is a limited liability company (LLC).

If the members' respective equity interests are allocated based on the members' <ref target="1026-36-d-1-ii" reftype="term">terms of transactions</ref>, rather than according to their respective capital contributions, then distributions based on such equity interests are not bona fide and, thus, are <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>.</content></interpParagraph>

              <content>Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

For example, during a given calendar year, <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A and <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> B are each employed by a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> and paid $40,000 in salary, $44,000 in commissions, and other benefits that have a cash value of $1,000.

Neither <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> is paid any other form of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. In December of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> rewards both <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> for their performance during the calendar year out of a bonus pool established with reference to the profits of the mortgage origination business unit. <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">Individual loan originator</ref> A is paid a $10,000 cash bonus, meaning that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A's total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is $100,000. <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">Individual loan originator</ref> B is paid a $7,500 cash bonus and awarded a vacation package with a cash value of $3,000, meaning that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> B's total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is $100,500. Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A's $10,000 bonus is permissible because the bonus would not constitute more than 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A's total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for the calendar year.

                <content>Assume that, in a given calendar year, a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> employee $40,000 in salary and $125,000 in commissions, and makes a contribution of $15,000 to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s 401(k) plan. At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations. Assume that the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref>. In this example, the performance bonus would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref>' transactions as described in § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(i)</ref>, because it is being funded out of a profit pool derived in part from mortgage originations. Thus, the bonus is permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> if it does not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, which in this example consists of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s salary, commissions, contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> elects to include the contribution in calculating total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>), and the performance bonus.

Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. At the end of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> two bonuses: a “performance” bonus based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end “holiday” bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool.

Thus, while the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may change <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms or pricing to match a competitor, to avoid triggering high-cost mortgage provisions, or for other reasons, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> on that transaction may not be changed for those reasons. A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> therefore may not agree to reduce its <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> or provide a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay a portion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs, for example, to avoid high-cost mortgage provisions.

A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or other <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> might periodically review factors such as loan performance, transaction volume, as well as current market conditions for originator <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, and prospectively revise the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> it agrees to pay to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>.

No violation occurs even if the loans made by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, to reflect the higher <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>.</content></interpParagraph>

See § <ref target="1026-2-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.2(b)(3)</ref>.

For example, assume that a non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller (that is not the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) has an <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> with the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay $1,000 of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs on a transaction. Any of the $1,000 that is paid by the non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> and constitutes “compensation” as defined in § <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)(3)</ref> to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, even if the <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> does not specify that some or all of $1,000 must be used to compensate the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. Nonetheless, payments by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

The absence of any significant adverse information is sufficient to support an affirmative determination that the individual meets the standards. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, the existence of current outstanding judgments, tax liens, other government liens, nonpayment of child support, or a pattern of bankruptcies, foreclosures, or delinquent accounts. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is not required to consider debts arising from medical expenses. A review and assessment of character and general fitness is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, acts of unfairness or dishonesty, including dishonesty by the individual in the course of seeking employment or in connection with determinations pursuant to the qualification requirements of § <ref target="1026-36-f" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)</ref>, and any disciplinary actions by regulatory or professional licensing agencies.
