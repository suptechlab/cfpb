This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref> does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>. See § <ref target="1026-35-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)(2)</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the general disclosure requirements for <ref target="1026-2-a-10" reftype="term">closed-end credit</ref> (§ <ref target="1026-17" reftype="internal">1026.17</ref>) provide that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> and comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.
