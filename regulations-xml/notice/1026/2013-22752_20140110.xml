      <content>Section <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(8)</ref> includes in the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations premiums or charges protecting the creditor against the consumer's default or other credit loss. This includes all premiums or similar charges, whether denominated as mortgage insurance, guarantee, or otherwise, as determined according to applicable State or Federal law. For example, monthly “private mortgage insurance” payments paid to a non-governmental entity, annual “guarantee fee” payments required by a Federal housing program, and a quarterly “mortgage insurance” payment paid to a State agency administering a housing program are all mortgage-related obligations for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(8)</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(8)</ref> includes these charges in the definition of mortgage-related obligations if the creditor requires the consumer to pay them, even if the consumer is not legally obligated to pay the charges under the terms of the insurance program. For example, if a mortgage insurance program obligates the creditor to make recurring mortgage insurance payments, and the creditor requires the consumer to reimburse the creditor for such recurring payments, the consumer's payments are mortgage-related obligations for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(8)</ref>. However, if a mortgage insurance program obligates the creditor to make recurring mortgage insurance payments, and the creditor does not require the consumer to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the mortgage insurance payments, the recurring mortgage insurance payments are not mortgage-related obligations for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(8)</ref>.</content>

      <content>Section <ref target="1026-43-f-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(2)(iii)</ref> facilitates sales that are deemed necessary by supervisory agencies to revive troubled creditors and resolve failed creditors. A balloon-payment qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)</ref> retains its qualified mortgage status if it is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person pursuant to: (1) A capital restoration plan or other action under 12 U.S.C. 1831o; (2) the actions or instructions of any person acting as conservator, receiver, or bankruptcy trustee; (3) an order of a State or Federal government agency with jurisdiction to examine the creditor pursuant to State or Federal law; or (4) an agreement between the creditor and such an agency. A balloon-payment qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)</ref> that is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred under these circumstances retains its qualified mortgage status regardless of how long after consummation it is sold and regardless of the size or other characteristics of the transferee. Section <ref target="1026-43-f-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(2)(iii)</ref> does not apply to transfers done to comply with a generally applicable regulation with future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy in the absence of a specific order by or a specific agreement with a governmental agency described in § <ref target="1026-43-f-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(2)(iii)</ref> directing the sale of one or more qualified mortgages under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)</ref> held by the creditor or one of the other circumstances listed in § <ref target="1026-43-f-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(2)(iii)</ref>. For example, a balloon-payment qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)</ref> that is sold pursuant to a capital restoration plan under 12 U.S.C. 1831o would retain its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale. However, if the creditor simply chose to sell the same qualified mortgage as one way to comply with general regulatory capital requirements in the absence of supervisory action or agreement the transaction would lose its status as a qualified mortgage following thesale unless it qualifies under another definition of qualified mortgage.</content>
