        <content>Under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(B)</ref>, a qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> may be sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred at any time to another <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that meets the requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref>(v). That section requires that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, during the preceding calendar year, together with all <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, 500 or fewer first-lien <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> and had total assets less than $2 billion (as adjusted for inflation) at the end of the preceding calendar year. A qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> transferred to a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that meets these criteria would retain its qualified mortgage status even if it is transferred less than three years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.</content></interpParagraph>

        <content>Section <ref target="1026-43-e-5-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C)</ref> facilitates sales that are deemed necessary by supervisory agencies to revive troubled <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> and resolve failed <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref>. A qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> retains its qualified mortgage status if it is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> pursuant to: A capital restoration plan or other action under <ref target="USC:12-1831" reftype="external">12 U.S.C. 1831</ref>o; the actions or instructions of any <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> acting as conservator, receiver or bankruptcy trustee; an order of a <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or Federal government agency with jurisdiction to examine the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pursuant to <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or Federal law; or an <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> between the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> and such an agency. A qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> that is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred under these circumstances retains its qualified mortgage status regardless of how long after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> it is sold and regardless of the size or other characteristics of the transferee. Section <ref target="1026-43-e-5-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C)</ref> does not apply to transfers done to comply with a generally applicable regulation with future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy in the absence of a specific order by or a specific <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> with a governmental agency described in § <ref target="1026-43-e-5-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C)</ref> directing the sale of one or more qualified mortgages under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> held by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or one of the other circumstances listed in § <ref target="1026-43-e-5-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C)</ref>. For example, a qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> that is sold pursuant to a capital restoration plan under <ref target="USC:12-1831" reftype="external">12 U.S.C. 1831</ref>o would retain its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale. However, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> simply chose to sell the same qualified mortgage as one way to comply with general regulatory capital requirements in the absence of supervisory action or <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> it would lose its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale unless it qualifies under another definition of qualified mortgage.</content></interpParagraph>

        <content>A qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> retains its qualified mortgage status if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> merges with, is acquired by, or acquires another <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> regardless of whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or its successor is eligible to originate new qualified mortgages under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> after the merger or acquisition. However, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or its successor can originate new qualified mortgages under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> only if it complies with all of the requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> after the merger or acquisition. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that originates 250 <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> each year and originates qualified mortgages under § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> is acquired by a larger <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that originates 10,000 <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> each year. Following the acquisition, the small <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would no longer be able to originate § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> qualified mortgages because, together with its <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, it would originate more than 500 <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> each year. However, the § <ref target="1026-43-e-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(5)</ref> qualified mortgages originated by the small <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> before the acquisition would retain their qualified mortgage status.</content>
