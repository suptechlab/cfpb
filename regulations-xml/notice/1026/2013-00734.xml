            <content>Under § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> elects under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. If the transaction is determined to be a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref>, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> to establish and maintain an <ref target="1026-35-b-3-iv" reftype="term">escrow account</ref>, and the period for which the <ref target="1026-35-b-3-iv" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> must remain in place under § <ref target="1026-35-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(3)</ref> is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent phase financing occurs.</content>

            <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an <ref target="1026-35-b-3-iv" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance.

Specifically, a county is “underserved” if, in the applicable calendar year's public HMDA aggregate dataset, no more than two <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> have reported five or more first-lien <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> with HMDA geocoding that places the properties in that county. For purposes of this determination, because only <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> are counted, all first-lien originations (and only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as “Not owner-occupied” (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as “Multifamily” (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co-applicant's sex is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 4).

        <content>A county is considered to be “rural” or “underserved” for purposes of § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A)</ref> if it satisfies either of the two tests in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> applies both tests to each county in the United States and, if a county satisfies either test, the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> will include the county on a published list of “rural” or “underserved” counties for a particular calendar year. To facilitate compliance with § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> also creates a list of only those counties that are “rural” but not also “underserved.” The <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> will post on its public Web site the applicable lists for each calendar year by the end of that year. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely as a safe harbor, pursuant to section 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act, on the lists of counties published by the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> to determine whether a county qualifies as “rural” or “underserved” for a particular calendar year. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s originations of <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref>, as defined by § 1026.43(b)(1), in such counties during that year are considered in determining whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> satisfies the condition in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A)</ref> and therefore will be eligible for the exemption during the following calendar year.</content>

          <content>Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)</ref>, a county is rural during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. These areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Specifically, the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> classifies a county as “rural” if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.

          <content>Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv-B" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B)</ref>, a county is underserved during a calendar year if, according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for that year, no more than two <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> extend first-lien <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref>, as defined in § 1026.43(b)(1), secured by a first lien five or more times in the county. These areas are defined by reference to the specific calendar year's HMDA data. Specifically, a county is “underserved” if, in the applicable calendar year's public HMDA aggregate dataset, no more than two <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> have reported five or more first-lien <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> with HMDA geocoding that places the properties in that county. For purposes of this determination, because only <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> are counted, all first-lien originations (and only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as “Not owner-occupied” (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as “Multifamily” (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co-applicant's sex is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 4).

      <title type="keyterm">Planned unit developments.</title>
      <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an <ref target="1026-35-b-3-iv" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</content>

        <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may make a <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> that has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated. Such an <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” Even if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is otherwise eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref>, a first-lien <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is subject to the requirement to establish an <ref target="1026-35-b-3-iv" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> unless the purchaser is also eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref> or the transaction is otherwise exempt under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)</ref>.
