          <content>Section <ref target="1026-36-g" reftype="internal">1026.36(g)</ref> requires a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> organization to include its name and NMLSR ID and the name and NMLSR ID of the individual <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> on certain loan documents. As provided in § <ref target="1026-36-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)(1)</ref>, the term “loan originator” includes <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> that engage in <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> activities for purposes of this requirement. Thus, for example, if an individual <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> employed by a bank originates a loan, the names and NMLSR IDs of the individual and the bank must be included on covered loan documents. The NMLSR ID is a number generally assigned by the NMLSR to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan origination services. For more information, see the SAFE Act sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its implementing regulations (12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> organization may also have an NMLSR unique identifier.</content>

For example,certain <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> organizations and individual <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>s who are employees of bona fide nonprofit organizations may not be required to obtain a unique identifier under State law. However, some <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>s may have obtained NMLSR IDs, even if they are not required to have one for their current jobs. If a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> organization or an individual <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> has been provided a unique identifier by the NMLSR, it must be included on the covered loan documents, regardless of whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> organization or individual <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is required to obtain an NMLSR unique identifier.
