      <content>Services, together with <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. To qualify as a small servicer, under § <ref target="CFR:12-1024-31" reftype="external">1026.41(e)(4)(</ref>ii)(A), a servicer must service, together with any <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, for all of which the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) is the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee. There are two elements to satisfying § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A)</ref>. First, a servicer, together with any <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. Second, a servicer must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) is the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee. To be the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee of a mortgage loan, the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) must either currently own the mortgage loan or must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A servicer is not a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A)</ref> if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> is not the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee (that is, for which the servicer or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> is not the owner or was not the originator). The following two examples demonstrate circumstances in which a servicer would not qualify as a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A)</ref> because it did not meet both requirements under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A)</ref> for determining a servicer's status as a small servicer:</content>

      <content>To qualify as a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref>, a servicer must be a nonprofit entity that services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities, for all of which the servicer or an associated nonprofit entity is the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. There are two elements to satisfying § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref>. First, a nonprofit entity must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities. For each associated nonprofit entity, the small servicer determination is made separately, without consideration of the number of loans serviced by another associated nonprofit entity. Second, a nonprofit entity must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. To be the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A nonprofit entity is not a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref> if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is not the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> (that is, for which the servicer or an associated nonprofit entity was not the originator). The first of the following two examples demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would qualify as a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref> because it meets both requirements for determining a nonprofit entity's status as a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref>. The second example demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would not qualify as a small servicer under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref> because it does not meet both requirements under § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C)</ref>.</content>

        <content>For purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv-B" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(B)</ref>, interest is calculated using the contract interest rate applicable during the period from <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> until the payment described in § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iv)</ref> is made to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. In an adjustable-rate or step-rate transaction in which more than one interest rate applies during the period from <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> until payment is made to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, the minimum payment amount is determined by calculating interest on the dollar amount described in § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A)</ref> at each such interest rate for the part of the overall period during which that rate applies. However, § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iv)</ref> provides that, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iii)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee can pay to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> an amount that exceeds the sum of the amounts described in § <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A)</ref> and <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iv-B" reftype="internal">(B)</ref>. Therefore, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or assignee may, for example, elect to calculate interest using the maximum interest rate that may apply during the period from <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> until payment is made to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. See comment <ref target="1026-43-e-3-iii-Interp-1" reftype="internal">43(e)(3)(iii)-1</ref> for guidance on making payments to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.</content>

        <title type="keyterm">Relationship to RESPA tolerance cure.</title>
        <content>Under Regulation X (<ref target="CFR:12-1024-7" reftype="external">12 CFR 1024.7</ref>(i)), if any charges at settlement exceed the charges listed on the good faith estimate of settlement costs by more than the amounts permitted under <ref target="CFR:12-1024-7" reftype="external">12 CFR 1024.7</ref>(e), the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> may cure the tolerance violation by reimbursing the amount by which the tolerance was exceeded at settlement or within 30 calendar days after settlement.
