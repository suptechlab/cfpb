      <content>The <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref>'s revisions to Regulation X and Regulation Z published on December 31, 2013 (the TILA-RESPA Final Rule), apply to covered loans (closed-end credit transactions secured by real property) for which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or mortgage broker receives an <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> on or after October 3, 2015 (the “effective date”), except that new § <ref target="1026-19-e-2" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-2" reftype="term">amendments</ref> to § <ref target="1026-28-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.28(a)(1)</ref>, and the <ref target="1026-58-b-2" reftype="term">amendments</ref> to the commentary to § <ref target="1026-29-Interp" reftype="internal">1026.29</ref>, become effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> has been received. The provisions of § <ref target="1026-19-e-2" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)</ref> apply prior to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s receipt of the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, and therefore, restrict activity that may occur prior to receipt of an <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> by a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or mortgage broker under § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>. These provisions include § <ref target="1026-19-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)(i)</ref>, which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, § <ref target="1026-19-e-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)(ii)</ref>, which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, and § <ref target="1026-19-e-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)(iii)</ref>, which prohibits <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s application. Accordingly, the provisions under § <ref target="1026-19-e-2" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(2)</ref> are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> has been received on that date. In addition, the <ref target="1026-58-b-2" reftype="term">amendments</ref> to § <ref target="1026-28" reftype="internal">1026.28</ref> and the commentary to § <ref target="1026-29-Interp" reftype="internal">1026.29</ref> govern the preemption of <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> laws and thus, the <ref target="1026-58-b-2" reftype="term">amendments</ref> to those provisions and associated commentary made by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> has been received on that date. The following examples illustrate the <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> of the effective date for the TILA-RESPA Final Rule.</content>

The requirement to provide the special information booklet under § <ref target="1026-19-g" reftype="internal">1026.19(g)</ref> of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule would also not apply to the transaction.
