        <content>The requirement that a finance charge may be computed and imposed from time to time on the outstanding balance means that there is no specific amount financed for the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated.

A <ref target="1026-57-a-1" reftype="term">college student credit card</ref> includes a college affinity card within the meaning of TILA section 127(r)(1)(A). In addition, a card may fall within the scope of the definition regardless of the fact that it is not intentionally targeted at or marketed to <ref target="1026-57-a-2" reftype="term">college students</ref>. For example, an agreement between a college and a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> may provide for marketing of <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> to alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> who have a relationship with the college, but also contain provisions that contemplate the issuance of cards to students. A <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> issued to a student at the college in connection with such an agreement qualifies as a <ref target="1026-57-a-1" reftype="term">college student credit card</ref>.

        <content>Section <ref target="1026-57-a-5" reftype="internal">1026.57(a)(5)</ref> defines “college credit card agreement” to include any business, marketing or promotional agreement between a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> and a college or university (or an <ref target="1026-57-a-4" reftype="term">affiliated organization</ref>, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement provides for the issuance of <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> to full-time or part-time students. Business, marketing or promotional agreements may include a broad range of arrangements between a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> and an <ref target="1026-57-a-3" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref> or <ref target="1026-57-a-4" reftype="term">affiliated organization</ref>, including arrangements that do not meet the criteria to be considered college affinity card agreements as discussed in TILA section 127(r)(1)(A). For example, TILA section 127(r)(1)(A) specifies that under a college affinity card agreement, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> has agreed to make a donation to the institution or <ref target="1026-57-a-4" reftype="term">affiliated organization</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> has agreed to offer discounted terms to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, or the <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> will display pictures, symbols, or words identified with the institution or <ref target="1026-57-a-4" reftype="term">affiliated organization</ref>; even if these conditions are not met, an agreement may qualify as a <ref target="1026-57-a-5" reftype="term">college credit card agreement</ref>, if the agreement is a business, marketing or promotional agreement that contemplates the issuance of <ref target="1026-57-a-1" reftype="term">college student credit cards</ref> to <ref target="1026-57-a-2" reftype="term">college students</ref> currently enrolled (either full-time or part-time) at the institution. An agreement may qualify as a <ref target="1026-57-a-5" reftype="term">college credit card agreement</ref> even if marketing of cards under the agreement is targeted at alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref>, as long as cards may also be issued to students in connection with the agreement. This definition also includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> and a college or university (or an <ref target="1026-57-a-4" reftype="term">affiliated organization</ref>, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement provides for the addition of a covered separate credit feature that is a <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> account under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> as defined by § 1026.61 to prepaid accounts previously issued to full-time or part-time students.

Hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> and covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit features</ref> accessible by hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> are also subject to other rules in this regulation, and some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance related to hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> and covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit features</ref> accessible by hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref>. For example, as discussed in §§ <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(15)(i)</ref> and <ref target="1026-61-a" reftype="internal">1026.61(a)</ref>, a hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> is a <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit feature</ref>. A covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit feature</ref> accessible by a hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> also will be a <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> account under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan as defined in § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) if the covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit feature</ref> is an <ref target="1026-2-a-20" reftype="term">open-end credit</ref> plan.

Some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance with respect to hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref> and covered <ref target="1026-61-a-5-viii" reftype="term">separate credit features</ref> accessible by hybrid prepaid-<ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit cards</ref>.
