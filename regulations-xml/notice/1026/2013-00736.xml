                <content>Section <ref target="1026-32-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(3)</ref> provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. To satisfy this standard, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market transactions. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on pricing in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary market. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also establish that its interest rate reduction is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide imposes a cap on <ref target="1026-32-b-1" reftype="term">points and fees</ref> but excludes from the cap discount points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a discount point and the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-E" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)</ref> or <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-F" reftype="internal">(F)</ref> are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the calculation of <ref target="1026-32-b-1" reftype="term">points and fees</ref>.</content></interpParagraph>

              <content>For purposes of § <ref target="1026-32-b-6-i" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(6)(i)</ref>, the following are examples of prepayment penalties:</content>
              <interpParagraph label="1026-32-b-6-Interp-1-i" marker="i.">
                <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any <ref target="1026-54-a-2" reftype="term">grace period</ref>). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content></interpParagraph>

However, the term prepayment penalty does not include a waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pays all of a <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>'s principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. For example, assume that at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> provide that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may recoup the $3,000 in waived charges if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

Examples of such a loan are a loan to finance the purchase of a new <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> plans to sell a current <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> within 12 months and a loan to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>.

              <content>Under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>, a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>. A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. For such a loan, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as separate transactions for the purpose of compliance with § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, and the construction phase of the loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, provided the initial term is 12 months or less. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, allowing similar treatment for disclosures. Where the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term of that construction phase does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial term is 12 months. Any renewal of one year or less also qualifies for the exemption. The permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is not exempt under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>. It may be a qualified mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</content>

For purposes of determining the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> where the initial interest rate is not determined using the index or formula for subsequent interest rate adjustments, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the interest rate that would have applied had the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> used such index or formula plus margin at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> of $200,000, even though the loan <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> provides that only $100,000 will be disbursed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

              <content>The term “recast” means, for an <ref target="1026-18-s-7-i" reftype="term">adjustable-rate mortgage</ref>, the expiration of the period during which payments based on the introductory fixed rate are permitted; for an <ref target="1026-18-s-7-iv" reftype="term">interest-only loan</ref>, the expiration of the period during which the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-iv" reftype="term">interest-only</ref> payments are permitted; and, for a <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization loan</ref>, the expiration of the period during which negatively amortizing payments are permitted.

To illustrate: A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> provides for a fixed interest rate and permits <ref target="1026-18-s-7-iv" reftype="term">interest-only</ref> payments for the first five years of the loan (60 months). The loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 60th monthly payment. Thus, the term of the loan remaining as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> is 25 years (300 months).</content></interpParagraph>

                  <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

              <content>Section <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> sets forth factors <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must consider when making the ability-to-repay determination required under § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref> and the accompanying commentary provides guidance regarding these factors. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> must conform to these requirements and may rely on guidance provided in the commentary. However, § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the provisions of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting criteria. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to guidance issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property as “income,” “debt,” or “assets.” Similarly, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or what information to use when evaluating the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “credit” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>. These examples are illustrative, and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such entities. However, as required by § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>, result in a reasonable, good faith determination of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards or when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself unreasonable.</content></interpParagraph>

                <content>In determining a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> under § <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s payment obligation on any <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be or has been made at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>. For example, where a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is a home purchase loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s periodic payment obligation for any “piggyback” second-lien loan that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be used to finance part of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s down payment. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with this requirement where, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> follows policies and procedures that are designed to determine whether at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has applied for another credit transaction secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. To illustrate, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives an application for a home purchase loan where the requested <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> is less than the home purchase price. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s policies and procedures must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to state the source of the down payment and provide verification. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> determines the source of the down payment is another extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> that will be made to the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> and secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know of the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> and must consider the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref>. Alternatively, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has information that suggests the down payment source is the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s existing assets, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would be under no further obligation to determine whether a <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> will be extended at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not obligated to investigate beyond reasonable underwriting policies and procedures to determine whether a <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> will be extended at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>.</content>

              <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report generally is considered a reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> under § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> for purposes of verifying items customarily found on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, such as the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s current debt obligations, monthly debts, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history. Section <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> generally does not require <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to obtain additional reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> to verify information contained in a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report states the existence and amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s debt obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not required to obtain additional verification of the existence or amount of that obligation. In contrast, a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report does not serve as a reasonably reliably <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> for purposes of verifying items that do not appear on the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. For example, certain monthly debt obligations, such as legal obligations like alimony or child support, may not be reflected on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. Thus, a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report that does not list a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly alimony obligation does not serve as a reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> for purposes of verifying that obligation. If a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report reflects a current debt obligation that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has not listed on the application, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> considers the existence and amount of the debt obligation as it is reflected in the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. However, in some cases a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may know or have reason to know that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report may be inaccurate in whole or in part. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may have information indicating that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is subject to a fraud alert, extended alert, active duty alert, or similar alert identified in <ref target="USC:15-1681" reftype="external">15 U.S.C. 1681</ref>c-1 or that a debt obligation listed on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is subject to a statement of dispute pursuant to <ref target="USC:15-1681" reftype="external">15 U.S.C. 1681</ref>i(b). A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also have other reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> or other information or evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> reasonably finds to be reliable that contradict the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report or otherwise indicate that the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is inaccurate. If a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report may be inaccurate in whole or in part, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> by disregarding an inaccurate or disputed item, items, or <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, but does not have to obtain additional <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also, but is not required, to obtain other reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> to verify information with respect to which the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, or item therein, may be inaccurate.

For example, if the rate for the first two years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 4 percent, the rate for the following two years is 5 percent, and the rate for the next two years is 6 percent, the rate that must be used is 6 percent.</content></interpParagraph>

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may rebut the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s residual income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical expenses of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and after taking into account the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> securing the loan, such as a savings account. In addition, the longer the period of time that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or, for an <ref target="1026-18-s-7-i" reftype="term">adjustable-rate mortgage</ref>, after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, the less likely the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</content></interpParagraph>
