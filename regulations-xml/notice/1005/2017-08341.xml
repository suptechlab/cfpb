          <title type="keyterm">Date for determining whether issuer qualifies.</title>
          <content>Whether an issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception is determined as of the last day of each calendar quarter. For example, an issuer has 2,500 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> as of December 31, the last day of the calendar quarter. As of January 30, the issuer has 3,100 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. As of March 31, the last day of the following calendar quarter, the issuer has 2,700 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. Even though the issuer had 3,100 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> at one time during the calendar quarter, the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception because the number of open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> was less than 3,000 as of March 31. The issuer therefore is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau under § <ref target="1005-19-b-1" reftype="internal">1005.19(b)(1)</ref>.</content>

          <title type="keyterm">Date for determining whether issuer ceases to qualify.</title>
          <content>Whether an issuer ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception under § le, an issuer has 2,500 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> as of June 30, the last day of the calendar quarter. The issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau under § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19(b)</ref>(b) by July 30 (the 30th day after June 30) because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception. As of July 15, the issuer has 3,100 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. The issuer is not required to take any action at this time, because whether an issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b)(4) is determined as of the last day of the calendar quarter. The issuer still has 3,100 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> as of September 30. Because the issuer had 3,100 open <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> as of September 30, the issuer ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception and must submit its agreements to the Bureau by October 30, the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter.</content>

          <title type="keyterm">Option to withdraw agreements.</title>
          <content>Section <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b)(4) provides that if an issuer that did not previously qualify for the de minimis exception newly qualifies for the de minimis exception, the issuer must continue to make rolling submissions to the Bureau as required by § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref> (b)(1)until the issuer notifies the Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously submitted to the Bureau. For example, an issuer offers three agreements and has 3,001 open <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref> as of December 31. The issuer submitted each of the three agreements to the Bureau by January 30 as required under § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b). As of March 31, the issuer has only 2,999 open <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>. The issuer has two options. First, the issuer may notify the Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing each of the three agreements it previously submitted. Once the issuer has notified the Bureau, the issuer is no longer required to make rolling submissions to the Bureau under § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b) unless it later ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception. Alternatively, the issuer may choose not to notify the Bureau that it is withdrawing its agreements. In this case, the issuer must continue making rolling submissions to the Bureau as required by § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b). The issuer might choose not to withdraw its agreements if, for example, the issuer believes it will likely cease to qualify for the de minimis exception again in the near future.</content>

          <title type="keyterm">Agreements currently in effect.</title>
          <content>Agreements submitted to the Bureau must contain the provisions of the agreement and fee information currently in effect. For example, on June 1, an issuer decides to decrease the out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee associated with one of the agreements it offers. The change in that fee will become effective on August 1. The issuer must submit and post the amended agreement with the decreased out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee to the Bureau by August 31 as required by § <ref target="1005-19" reftype="internal">1005.19</ref>(b)(2) and <ref target="1005-19-c" reftype="internal">(c)</ref>.</content>

          <title type="keyterm">Integrated agreement requirement.</title>
          <content>Issuers may not submit provisions of the agreement or fee information in the form of change-in-terms notices or riders. The only addendum that may be submitted as part of an agreement is the optional fee information addendum described in § <ref target="1005-19-b-6-ii" reftype="internal">1005.19(b)(6)(ii)</ref>. Changes in provisions or fee information must be integrated into the body of the agreement or the optional fee information addendum described in § <ref target="1005-19-b-6-ii" reftype="internal">1005.19(b)(6)(ii)</ref>. For example, it would be impermissible for an issuer to submit to the Bureau an agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document on January 1 and subsequently submit a change-in-terms notice or an addendum to indicate amendments to the previously submitted agreement. Instead, the issuer must submit a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change-in-terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions document and a single optional addendum displaying variations in fee information.</content>
