There are five aggregate race categories: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and White. The Asian and the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate categories have seven and four subcategories, respectively. The Asian race subcategories are: Asian Indian; Chinese, Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian. The Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander race subcategories are: Native Hawaiian; Guamanian or Chamorro; Samoan; and Other Pacific Islander. You must report every aggregate race category selected by the applicant. If the applicant also selects one or more race subcategories, you must report each race subcategory selected by the applicant, except that you must not report more than a total of five aggregate race categories and race subcategories combined. For example, if the applicant selects all five aggregate race categories and also selects some race subcategories, you report only the five aggregate race categories. On the other hand, if the applicant selects the White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate race categories, and the applicant also selects the Korean, Vietnamese, and Samoan race subcategories, you must report White, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and any two, at your option, of the three race subcategories selected by the applicant. In this example, you must report White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and in addition you must report (at your option) either Korean and Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan, or Vietnamese and Samoan. To determine how to report an Other race subcategory for purposes of the five-race maximum, see paragraph <ref target="1003-B-1-9-iv" reftype="internal" action="added">9.iv below</ref>.</content>

In either such case, you must report both the selection of Other Asian or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable, and the additional information provided by the applicant, subject to the five-race maximum. In all such cases where the applicant has selected an Other race subcategory and also provided additional information, for purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined set forth above, the Other race subcategory and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection. Thus, using the same facts in the example offered in paragraph <ref target="1003-B-1-9-iii" reftype="internal" action="added">9.iii</ref> above, if the applicant also selected Other Asian and entered “Thai” in the space provided, Other Asian and Thai are considered one selection.

	      <title action="deleted">The broker rule and the meaning of “broker” and “investor.”</title>
	    <content action="deleted">For the purposes of the guidance given in this commentary, an institution that takes and processes a loan <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> and arranges for another institution to acquire the loan at or after closing is acting as a “broker,” and an institution that acquires a loan from a broker at or after closing is acting as an “investor.” (The terms used in this commentary may have different meanings in certain parts of the mortgage lending industry, and other terms may be used in place of these terms, for example in the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs.) Depending on the facts, a broker may or may not make a credit decision on an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> (and thus it may or may not have reporting responsibilities). If the broker makes a credit decision, it reports that decision; if it does not make a credit decision, it does not report. If an investor reviews an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> and makes a credit decision prior to closing, the investor reports that decision. If the investor does not review the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> prior to closing, it reports only the loans that it purchases; it does not report the loans it does not purchase. An institution that makes a credit decision on an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> prior to closing reports that decision regardless of whose name the loan closes in.</content></interpParagraph>

            <content action="deleted">Assume that, prior to closing, four investors receive the same <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> from a broker; two deny it, one approves it, and one approves it and acquires the loan. In these circumstances, the first two report denials, the third reports the transaction as approved but not accepted, and the fourth reports an origination (whether the loan closes in the name of the broker or the investor). Alternatively, assume that the broker denies a loan before sending it to an investor; in this situation, the broker reports a denial.</content></interpParagraph>

The broker reports as an origination a loan that it approves and closes, and reports as a denial an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> that it turns down (either because the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term" action="deleted">application</ref> does not meet the investor's underwriting guidelines or for some other reason).

If the institution then acquires the loan, it reports the loan as an origination whether the loan closes in the name of the institution or its affiliate. An institution that does not acquire the loan but takes some other action reports that action.</content>

For example, assume an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term" action="added">open-end line of credit</ref> contains an introductory or “teaser” interest rate for two months after the date of account opening, after which the interest rate may adjust.

                  <content action="deleted"><ref target="1003-4-a-12-ii" reftype="term" action="deleted">Average prime offer rates</ref> are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms offered to borrowers by a representative sample of lenders for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain <ref target="1003-4-a-12-ii" reftype="term" action="deleted">average prime offer rates</ref>, the Bureau uses a survey of lenders that both meets the criteria of § <ref target="1003-4-a-12-ii" reftype="internal" action="deleted">1003.4(a)(12)(ii)</ref> and provides pricing terms for at least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non-variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey®.</content>

For example, where the applicant indicates on the <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> that there is a mortgage on the property or where the applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage—and that mortgage will not be paid off as part of the transaction—the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a subordinate lien.
