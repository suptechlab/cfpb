If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any order of the hearing officer which directs compliance with all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under this section, the Bureau's General Counsel may, on its own motion or at the request of the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, apply to an appropriate United States district court, in the name of the Bureau but on relation of such party, for an order requiring compliance with so much of the subpoena as the hearing officer has not quashed or modified, unless, in the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena would be inconsistent with law and the policies of title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. Failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes a waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought.</content>

      <title>Section 1081.203 Scheduling Conference</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section requires the parties to meet before the initial scheduling conference to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, and other matters to be determined at the scheduling conference.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Within 20 days of the service of the notice of charges, or at another time if the parties agree, the hearing officer and the parties are to have a scheduling conference. This section sets forth the issues to be discussed at the scheduling conference. These issues are drawn from those the parties are required to discuss at scheduling and prehearing conferences under the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.31, the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221, and the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21. Paragraph (b)(1) provides that the parties shall be prepared to address the determination of hearing dates and location, and whether, in proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act, the hearing should commence later than 60 days after service of the notice of charges. This provision was added to account for the requirement in section 1053(b) of the Act that the hearing be held no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice of charges, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Bureau at the request of any party so served. It is expected that the parties shall discuss a hearing date at the scheduling conference, and that this would afford respondents the opportunity to request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>It is also expected that at or before the scheduling conference, the parties will discuss any issues related to the production of documents pursuant to § 206, any anticipated motions for witness statements pursuant to § 207, whether either party intends to issue documentary subpoenas, and whether either party believes that depositions will be necessary to preserve the testimony of witnesses who will be unavailable for the hearing. The parties are also expected to discuss the need and a schedule for any expert discovery.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The hearing officer is required to issue a scheduling order at or within five days of the conclusion of the scheduling hearing, setting forth the date and location of the hearing, as well as other procedural determinations made. It is expected that the hearing officer will establish any dates for expert discovery in the scheduling order, or else expressly find that such discovery is not necessary or reasonable in a particular case. This scheduling order will govern the course of the proceedings, unless later modified by the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Provision for a prompt scheduling conference followed by prompt issuance of a scheduling order is necessary in order to allow for the orderly course of proceedings on the timeline set forth elsewhere in the Rules. Particularly in cases brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Act in which the respondent does not request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the statute, it is essential that the hearing officer and the parties have a clear understanding of the applicable schedule at the earliest possible date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As provided for in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221(f), this section provides that any person named as a respondent in a notice of charges who fails to appear at a scheduling conference may be deemed in default pursuant to § 201(d)(1). Finally, like the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21(g), this section provides that scheduling conferences are presumptively public unless the hearing officer determines otherwise based on the standard set forth in § 119.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.202 Amended Pleadings</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section provides that the parties may amend the notice of charges or the answer at any stage of the proceeding. Formal amendments to the notice of charges and answer are not required when an issue not raised by the notice of charges or answer is tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties. In the event that a party seeks to introduce evidence at a hearing that is outside the scope of matters raised in the notice of charges or answer, the hearing officer may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action unless the objecting party demonstrates that admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The Bureau has adopted this liberal standard to the amendment of the pleadings to promote adjudication on the merits, and believes that the standard set forth in the rule should adequately protect parties from undue prejudice.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.201 Answer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section requires a respondent to file an answer in all cases. The Bureau considered, but rejected, the approach set forth in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.220(a), whereby an answer is required only if specified in the notice of charges. The Bureau believes that an answer can help focus and narrow the matters at issue. Respondents must file an answer within 14 days of service of the notice of charges. The 14-day time period is adopted from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.12. As in the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.19(c), failure to file a timely answer is deemed to be a waiver of the right to appear and a consent to the entry of an order granting the relief sought by the Bureau in the notice of charges. This section provides that in the case of default, the hearing officer is authorized, without further proceedings, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of charges and to enter a recommended decision containing appropriate findings and conclusions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section adopts the procedure from the SEC Rules for a motion to set aside a default, 17 CFR 201.155. It also provides that the hearing officer, prior to the filing of the recommended decision, or the Director, at any time, may set aside a default for good cause shown.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.200 Commencement of Proceedings and Contents of Notice of Charges</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section, similar to the comparable Uniform Rule, 12 CFR 19.18, contains the requirements relating to the initiation of adjudication proceedings, including the required content of a notice of charges initiating a hearing. In provisions modeled on the MARs and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> MARs, 11 T.M. Cooley L. Rev. at 96; Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a), this section also sets forth the circumstances under which the Bureau may voluntarily dismiss an adjudication proceeding, either on its own motion before the respondent(s) serve an answer, or by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared. Unless the notice or stipulation of dismissal states otherwise, a dismissal pursuant to this section is without prejudice. In keeping with the principle that Bureau proceedings are presumed to be public, this section also provides that a notice of charges shall be released to the public after affording the respondent or others an opportunity to seek a protective order to shield confidential information.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection target="1081-207" notice="2011-19032" date="2011-07-28">
      <title>Section 1081.207 Production of Witness Statements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.231, this section provides that a respondent may request for inspection and copying any statement of a Division of Enforcement witness that (1) pertains to or is expected to pertain to his or her direct testimony; and (2) would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500, if the adjudication proceeding were a criminal proceeding. This section is intended to promote the principles of transparency and efficiency discussed with respect to § 1081.206. Note, however, that the respondent is required to move for the production of these statements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Jencks Act does not require production of a witness' prior statement until the witness takes the stand. The Bureau expects that in most cases, the Division of Enforcement will provide prehearing production voluntarily. Submission of a witness' prior statement, however, may provide a motive for intimidation of that witness or improper contact by a respondent with the witness. The rule provides, therefore, that the time for delivery of witness statements is to be determined by the hearing officer, so that a case-specific determination of such risks can be made if necessary. Upon a showing that there is substantial risk of improper use of a witness' prior statement, the hearing officer may take appropriate steps. For example, a hearing officer may delay production of a prior statement, or prohibit parties from communicating with particular witnesses.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like § 1081.206 and the SEC Rules, this section provides for a “harmless error” standard in the event the Division of Enforcement fails to make available a statement required to be made available by this section.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection target="1081-206" notice="2011-19032" date="2011-07-28">
      <title>Section 1081.206 Availability of Documents for Inspection and Copying</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled primarily after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230, this section adopts the SEC's affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery in administrative adjudications. Generally, this section requires that the Division of Enforcement make available for inspection and copying certain categories of documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement prior to the institution of proceedings from persons not employed by the Bureau, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this section will promote the fair and efficient resolution of administrative proceedings. A respondent's right to inspect and copy documents under this section is automatic; the respondent does not need to make a formal request for access through the hearing officer. Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings. The respondent will have access to the documents, testimony, and other information that the Bureau relied upon in determining to file a notice of charges, in addition to evidence that the Bureau will rely upon at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This approach has several advantages. By automatically providing respondents with the factual information gathered by the Division of Enforcement in the course of the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings, this provision helps ensure that respondents have a complete understanding of the basis for the Bureau's action and can more accurately and efficiently determine the nature of their defenses or whether they wish to seek settlement. Because this approach renders traditional document discovery largely unnecessary, it will lead to a faster and more efficient resolution of Bureau administrative proceedings, saving both the Bureau and respondents the resources typically expended in the civil discovery process.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section adopts most of the procedures and conditions set forth in the SEC Rules, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), the Division of Enforcement's obligation under this section relates to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement. Documents located only in the files of other divisions or offices are beyond the scope of the rule. The term “documents” has been defined in the same manner as the term “documentary material” in section 1051(4) of the Act, and encompasses, among other things, electronic files or other data or data compilations stored in any medium.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(1) also provides that the Division of Enforcement will make the documents available for inspection and copying. This provision is modeled after the SEC Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau anticipates that in most cases it will simply provide either paper or electronic copies of the material at issue to respondents, but has adopted the formulation in the rule to preserve flexibility and the Division of Enforcement's right to require inspection and copying in appropriate cases.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) describe the types of documents that are subject to the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(1). Paragraph (a)(2) provides that the Division of Enforcement shall also make available each civil investigative demand or other written request to provide documents or to be interviewed issued by the Division of Enforcement in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall also make available any final examination or inspection reports prepared by any other Division of the Bureau if the Division of Enforcement either intends to introduce any such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, any witness. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) are included in the SEC Rules, but have been broken out into a separate paragraph of this section because they do not comprise documents that the Division of Enforcement obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau, and thus do not technically fall within the scope of paragraph (a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to § 1081.208, a respondent may seek production of other documents pursuant to subpoena. Paragraph (a)(3) is intended to make clear that the affirmative disclosure obligation set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) does not preclude the availability of subpoenas as separately provided by the Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(4) provides that this section does not require the Division of Enforcement to produce a final examination or inspection report prepared by any other Division of the Bureau to a respondent who is not the subject of that report. The Bureau has added this provision, which does not appear in the SEC Rules, out of concern for the privileged and confidential nature of examination and inspection reports and to make clear that respondents cannot rely upon the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to require the production of supervision or examination reports concerning other persons. Although the disclosure obligation as drafted would not require the production of such reports, the Bureau is adding this provision to remove any question regarding the issue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(1) of this section permits the Division of Enforcement to withhold documents that would otherwise be produced under paragraph (a) under five exceptions. Exception (i) shields information subject to a claim of privilege. Exception (ii) protects as work product internal documents prepared by persons employed by the Bureau, including consulting experts, which will not be offered in evidence. Work product includes any notes, working papers, memoranda or other similar materials, prepared by an attorney or under an attorney's direction in anticipation of litigation. <em data-original="E-03">See Hickman</em> v. <em data-original="E-03"> Taylor,</em> 329 U.S. 495 (1947); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) and (b)(5). Accountants, paralegals, investigators, and consulting experts who work on an investigation do so at the direction of the Director, an associate director, or another supervisory attorney, and their work product is therefore shielded by the rule. Although such material would not fall within the purview of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the Bureau has retained this provision of the SEC Rule to make clear that such work product is not subject to the affirmative disclosure obligation. An examination or inspection report prepared by one of the Bureau's Supervision Divisions, which the Division of Enforcement intends to introduce into evidence or to use to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, a witness, is explicitly excluded from the materials that may be withheld pursuant to this exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Exception (iii) protects the identity of a confidential source. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C) and (D). Exception (iv) provides that documents need not be produced where applicable law prohibits their production. Exception (v) protects any other document or category of documents that the hearing officer determines may be withheld as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding, or otherwise for good cause shown. This exception is intended to provide the hearing officer with the flexibility to adjust the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to the particular contours of a proceeding. For example, this exception could be used in a situation where a single investigation involves a discrete segment or segments that are related only indirectly, or not at all, to the recommendations ultimately made to the Director with respect to the particular respondents in a specific proceeding. To require that documents not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding be made available, simply because they were obtained as part of a broad investigation, burdens the respondent as well as the Division of Enforcement with unnecessary costs and delay.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that paragraph (b) does not authorize the Division of Enforcement to withhold material exculpatory evidence in the possession of the Division of Enforcement that would otherwise be subject to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a). Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will provide respondents with material exculpatory evidence it has obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau even if such evidence is contained in documents that the Division of Enforcement is otherwise permitted to withhold pursuant to paragraph (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has declined to adopt the SEC Rules' explicit reference to <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> v. <em data-original="E-03"> Maryland,</em> 373 U.S. 83 (1963) in this context. Proceedings under this part are civil in nature, not criminal, and the requirements of <em data-original="E-03">Brady</em> are therefore inapplicable. The Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings, including any material exculpatory evidence so obtained. The Bureau understands this approach to be consistent with that provided for in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also added the clause “that would otherwise be required to be produced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section” to paragraph (b) to make clear that the material exculpatory evidence provision works in concert with paragraph (a), and does not impose a separate, free-standing obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence that is not otherwise within the scope of paragraph (a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) provides that the hearing officer may require the Division of Enforcement to submit a withheld document list, and may order that a withheld document be made available for inspection and copying.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraph (d), the Division of Enforcement is required to make the material governed by this section available for inspection and copying no later than seven days after service of the notice of charges. The Bureau has considered requiring production of the covered material at the time the notice of charges is served, but has decided against such an approach. A provision for a delay of no more than seven days will allow for the entry of any appropriate protective orders and is consistent with the SEC's approach in this regard. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 17 CFR 201.230(d). It is the Bureau's expectation that the Division of Enforcement will make this material available as soon as possible in every case.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (e) and (f) set forth the procedure to obtain copies of documents and the costs of such copies. As noted above, the Bureau anticipates providing electronic copies of the documents to respondents in most cases, and paragraph (f) accounts for such a provision of electronic documents. In order to preserve the discretion of the Division of Enforcement, however, this paragraph includes provisions governing the inspection and copying of documents. In order to provide for the safekeeping of documents subject to inspection, and to control costs associated with the implementation of this section, paragraph (e) provides that documents shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Bureau office where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties may agree. In cases in which electronic production is unwarranted, this process appears more likely to result in prompt access to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement that are the basis of the allegations contained in the notice of charges.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In a provision added by the Bureau, paragraph (g) of this section imposes upon the Division of Enforcement a duty to supplement its disclosures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it acquires information after making its disclosures that it intends to rely upon at a hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230(h), paragraph (h) provides for a “harmless error” standard in the event the Division of Enforcement fails to make available to a respondent a document required to be made available by this section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (i) is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31(g), and provides a “claw back” mechanism whereby inadvertent disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall not constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection, provided that the party took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Furthermore, paragraph (i) provides that disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall waive the privilege only if the waiver was intentional and that the scope of such waiver is limited to the undisclosed information or communications concerning the same subject matter, which in fairness ought to be considered together with the disclosed information or communications. Paragraph (i) expressly applies to disclosures made by any party during an adjudication proceeding.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.205 Non-Dispositive Motions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section governs all motions other than motions to dismiss or motions for summary disposition, which are governed by § 212. The section generally sets forth the requirements for filing a non-dispositive motion, and requires that all such motions must be in writing, state with particularity the relief sought, and include a proposed order. This section also makes clear that motions filed pursuant to sections that impose different requirements should follow those requirements, and the requirements of § 205 to the extent they are not inconsistent. For example, § 208(g), which relates to motions to quash subpoenas, provides for a shorter time period for the filing of a responsive brief and prohibits the filing of a reply unless requested by the hearing officer. These conditions govern motions to quash, but such motions are still subject to other provisions of § 205, including, <em data-original="E-03">inter alia,</em> the need to meet and confer, deadlines for the hearing officer's ruling, and length limitations of the briefs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the Uniform Rules and the FTC Rules, 12 CFR 19.23(d)(1); 16 CFR 3.22(d), this section gives a party 10 days after service of a non-dispositive motion to respond to such motion in writing. It provides for reply briefs, which must be filed within three days after service of the response. A party's failure to respond to a motion shall waive that party's right to oppose such motion and constitutes consent to the entry of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying that motion. This section adopts the SEC's 15-page length limitation for non-dispositive motions and oppositions, 17 CFR 201.154(c), and a six page length limitation for reply briefs. The Bureau has adopted these time and length limitations because they provide parties ample opportunity to express their views on matters that do not concern the ultimate disposition of the action.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section also requires parties to make a good faith effort to meet and confer prior to the filing of a non-dispositive motion in an effort to resolve the controversy by agreement. The Bureau has included the meet-and-confer requirement because it believes that such conferences can help obviate the need for, or narrow the scope of, disputed motions, thus saving both the parties and the hearing officer time and resources.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section provides that the hearing officer shall rule on a non-dispositive motion, and shall do so within 14 days after the expiration of the time for filing of all motions papers authorized by this section, and that the pendency of a motion shall not stay proceedings. This time limitation is based on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.22(e), and is intended to ensure the timely resolution of disputes so that the proceeding as a whole can conclude in a fair and expeditious manner. As noted above, both the FTC and the SEC have revised their rules of practice to provide for the more expeditious resolution of administrative adjudications, and the incorporation of a time period in which the hearing officer must rule on a non-dispositive motion is, in the views of the Bureau, a critical part of that effort. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 73 FR 58831, 58836 (Oct. 7, 2008) (FTC expects that provision requiring ALJs to decide motions within 14 days will expedite cases).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section sets forth rules regarding the offering and admissibility of evidence at hearings, and adopts evidentiary standards similar to those set forth in the FTC Rules, SEC Rules, and the Uniform Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The section provides that Enforcement Counsel shall bear the burden of proving the ultimate issue(s) of the Bureau's claims at the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with general administrative practice, this section provides that evidence that is relevant, material, reliable, and not unduly repetitive shall be admissible to the fullest extent authorized by the APA and other applicable law, and that evidence shall not be excluded solely on the basis of its being hearsay if it is otherwise admissible and bears satisfactory indicia of reliability.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section provides that official notice may be taken of any material fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either generally known or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. It provides further that duplicate copies of documents are admissible to the same extent as originals unless a genuine issue is raised about the veracity or legibility of a document. Parties may, at any stage of the proceeding, stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact or the authentication of any relevant documents. Such stipulations may be received in evidence at the hearing and are binding on the parties. This section also provides that documents generated by respondents that come from their own files are presumed authentic and kept in the regular course of business and that the burden of proof is on the respondent to introduce evidence to rebut such a presumption.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Objections to the admissibility of evidence must be timely made and a failure to object to the admission of evidence shall constitute a waiver of the objection. Parties are entitled to present their cases or defenses by sworn oral testimony and documentary evidence. Witnesses at a hearing are required to testify under oath or affirmation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The provisions in this section about introducing prior sworn statements of witnesses into the record are modeled after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.235. The section specifies the circumstances under which prior sworn statements by a non-party witness are admissible into the record. These statements can be admitted if a witness is dead, outside of the United States, unable to attend because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability, or if the party offering the sworn statement is unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena. Even if these conditions are not met, a prior sworn statement may be introduced into the record in the discretion of the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.209 Deposition of Witness Unavailable for Hearing</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section, generally modeled after the Uniform Rules and the SEC Rules, 12 CFR 19.27; 17 CFR 201.233, provides that parties may seek to depose material witnesses unavailable for the hearing upon application to the hearing officer for a deposition subpoena. The application must state that the witness is expected to be unavailable due to age, illness, infirmity or other reason and that the petitioning party was not the cause of the witness's unavailability. The Bureau has adopted the Uniform Rules' formulation of this standard, which provides for such depositions when the witness is “otherwise unavailable,” to account for the possible unavailability of witnesses for reasons other than those specified in the SEC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a)(2) requires a party seeking to record a deposition by audio-visual means to so note in the request for a deposition subpoena. This provision is modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(3). Paragraph (a)(4) also provides that a deposition cannot be taken on less than 14 days' notice to the witness and all parties, absent an order to the contrary from the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) incorporates several provisions from the SEC Rules. It provides that the witness being deposed may have an attorney present during the deposition; that objections to questions of evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer, but that only the hearing officer shall have the power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevance of evidence; that the deposition shall be filed with the Executive Secretary; and that transcripts shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also incorporates certain procedures from § 208 of the Rules pertaining to subpoenas. Those procedures are intended to protect against deposition requests that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, and to provide a mechanism for signing and service of a deposition subpoena, the filing of a motion to quash, and for enforcing subpoenas.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered whether respondents should be allowed to issue subpoenas for the purpose of compelling prehearing discovery depositions as is allowed in actions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including deposition practice, is often a source of delay, extensive collateral disputes and high litigation costs. The Bureau believes expanding the scope of prehearing discovery to permit discovery depositions is not warranted for several reasons.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, the Bureau believes that even if limitations were placed on the availability of discovery depositions, there remains a significant potential for extensive collateral litigation over their use. Second, use of discovery depositions is in tension with the statutory timetable for hearings in cease-and-desist proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act. Indeed, in part for this reason, the Rules allow the hearing officer to decide whether and to what extent to permit expert discovery in adjudication proceedings. Allowing prehearing depositions would present extreme scheduling difficulties in those cases in which respondents did not request hearing dates outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Third, the rationale for permitting oral depositions in litigation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply equally to a Bureau administrative proceeding. In the typical civil action between private parties, where neither party can compel testimony prior to the filing of the complaint, oral depositions play a critical role in permitting evidence to be gathered prior to trial. Here, by contrast, the Bureau can compel such testimony and is committed to making it available to respondents pursuant to § 1081.206.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, these Rules include three provisions that address in significant part a respondent's interest in obtaining discovery prior to the start of the hearing. Section 1081.206 mandates that the Division of Enforcement generally make available not only transcripts of testimony, but documents obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau during the investigation leading to the proceeding as well as certain documents of the Bureau. Section 1081.208 authorizes the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for the production of documents returnable at any designated time or place. In addition, § 1081.210 provides for expert discovery in appropriate cases. Given these discovery mechanisms, the ability to subpoena witnesses to testify at the hearing, the ability to take the deposition of material witnesses unavailable for hearing, and the ability of respondents to conduct informal discovery, the marginal benefits of prehearing depositions are not justified by their likely cost in time, expense, collateral disputes and scheduling complexities.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.208 Subpoenas</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section is modeled after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.232, and provides that, in connection with a hearing, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of a witness or the production of documents. The availability of subpoenas for witnesses and documents ensures that respondents have available to them the necessary tools to adduce evidence in support of their defenses. A subpoena may only be issued by the hearing officer (as opposed to counsel) and the section sets forth procedures to prevent the issuance of subpoenas that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome. The section also sets forth procedures and standards applicable to a motion to quash or modify a subpoena.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) of this section also provides that, if a subpoenaed person fails to comply, the Bureau, on its own motion or on the motion of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued, may seek an order requiring compliance. In accordance with section 1052(b)(2) of the Act, which authorizes the Bureau or a Bureau investigator to seek enforcement of a subpoena, paragraph (h) only authorizes the Bureau—and not the party at whose request the subpoena was issued—to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena. <em data-original="E-03">Compare</em> 12 CFR 19.26(c) (authorizing the “subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party” to seek judicial enforcement). In a provision added by the Bureau, this section also provides that failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought. This provision was added to prevent a respondent from declining to request that the Bureau seek to enforce the subpoena of a witness who fails to comply, and later claiming that his or her defense was prejudiced based upon the unavailability of that witness.</analysisParagraph>

Oral motions or arguments are also subject to the good faith certification: the act of making the oral motion or argument constitutes the required certification. Finally, this section makes clear that a violation of the good faith certification requirement would be grounds for sanctions under § 104(b)(13).

Because certain facts necessary for the Director to make a reasoned judgment as to whether a particular settlement offer is in the public interest will often be available only to the Bureau employee that negotiated the proposed settlement, paragraph (c)(4)(i) requires waiver of any provisions, under the Rules or otherwise, that may be construed to prohibit ex parte communications regarding the settlement offer between the Director and Bureau employee involved in litigating the proceeding. Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) requires waiver of any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Director arising from the Director's consideration or discussions concerning settlement of all or any part of the proceeding. If the Director rejects the offer of settlement, the person making the offer shall be notified of the Director's action. The rejection of the offer of settlement shall not affect the continued validity of the waivers pursuant to paragraph (c)(4).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.210 Expert Discovery</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section is modeled after the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31A. Neither the Uniform Rules nor the SEC Rules provide for expert discovery. The Bureau has provided for expert discovery so that the parties may fully understand the other side's position prior to the hearing, which will enable a clearer and more efficient airing of the issues at the hearing, and which may also clarify the issues for a possible prehearing settlement. It will also enable the parties to identify rebuttal expert witnesses, if needed, prior to the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (a) provides that the hearing officer shall establish a date for the exchange of expert reports in the scheduling order. This provision is intended to allow flexibility in scheduling expert discovery depending on the complexity of the case and the date of the hearing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) limits parties to five expert witnesses, including any rebuttal or surrebuttal experts, as do the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31A. The Bureau believes this is sufficient to provide the parties with an opportunity to adequately present expert testimony without unduly delaying the proceedings. Paragraph (b) also provides that no party may call an expert witness unless that witness has been identified and provided a report in accordance with this section, unless the hearing officer provides otherwise at a scheduling conference. The last clause is intended to reflect a hearing officer's discretion, at a scheduling conference, to dispense with or otherwise limit expert discovery in a particular case (as expressly provided for in paragraph (e) of this section).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) sets forth the required contents of an expert report. This section is based upon the corresponding provisions of the FTC Rules.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (d) provides for expert depositions, which are not to exceed 8 hours absent agreement of the parties or an order by the hearing officer. These time limits are intended to provide adequate time to prepare for expert testimony without unduly delaying the proceedings. Paragraph (d) also provides that expert depositions shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 1081.209. Finally, paragraph (d) provides that an expert's deposition shall be conducted after submission of the expert's report but no later than seven days prior to the deadline for submission of rebuttal expert reports. This provision is intended to allow parties to rely upon the deposition of an opposing party's expert in the preparation of a rebuttal expert report. Because, pursuant to paragraph (a), rebuttal reports are due 28 days after the exchange of expert reports, expert depositions will need to take place within that 28 day period.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, paragraph (e) authorizes the hearing officer to dispense with expert discovery in appropriate cases. The Bureau envisions hearing officers relying on this provision in cease-and-desist proceedings brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Act, where the respondent has not requested a hearing date outside the statutory 30-to-60 day timeframe. In such cases, it may be appropriate to dispense with expert discovery for timing reasons, while allowing the parties to call expert witnesses.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.211 Interlocutory Review</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section sets forth the procedure and standards applicable to interlocutory review by the Director of a ruling or order of the hearing officer. In contrast to the practice in the federal judicial system, but like the SEC, the Director may take up a matter on his or her own motion at any time, even if a hearing officer does not certify it for interlocutory review.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) provides that any party may file a motion for certification of a ruling or order for interlocutory review within five days of service of the order or ruling. Responses to such motions are due within three days, and the hearing officer is required to rule upon such a motion within five days thereafter.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) sets forth the permissible bases for certifying a ruling or order. Certification is appropriate if the hearing officer's ruling would compel testimony or production of documents from Bureau officers or employees, or officers or employees from another governmental agency. This is consistent with the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.400. Like FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.23(a)(1), however, this provision includes officers and employees from other governmental agencies, and not just the Bureau, in order to afford the same treatment to other agencies within the federal government. Paragraph (c) also provides for certification of rulings or orders as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate review may materially advance the completion of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy. The hearing officer may also certify a ruling or order where the ruling or order involves a motion for disqualification of the hearing officer or the suspension of an individual from appearing before the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (d) provides that a party whose motion for certification is denied by the hearing officer may petition the Director directly for interlocutory review. This provision is intended to guard against a hearing officer's unwillingness to certify a ruling that appears to meet the standards set forth in the section. The Bureau expects such direct petitions to the Director to be used sparingly.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (e) governs the Director's review of matters certified pursuant to paragraph (c) or for which review is sought pursuant to paragraph (d). It sets forth the policy of the Bureau that interlocutory review is disfavored and provides that the Director will grant such review only in extraordinary circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (f) provides that proceedings will not be stayed by the filing of a motion for certification for interlocutory review or a grant of such review unless the hearing officer or the Director shall so order.

      <title>Section 1081.212 Dispositive Motions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section lays out the procedures and standards for motions to dismiss and motions for summary disposition. It expressly provides for the filing of motions to dismiss, but makes clear that filing such a motion does not affect a party's obligation to file an answer or take any other action. This is intended to ensure that motions to dismiss do not delay the proceedings unnecessarily. The timelines for decisions on dispositive motions, discussed below, should help ensure that a party ultimately determined to be entitled to dismissal is not required to engage in the adjudicative process for a lengthy period of time.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (b) provides that a respondent may file a motion to dismiss asserting that, even assuming the truth of the facts alleged in the notice of charges, it is entitled to dismissal as a matter of law. Neither the SEC Rules, the FTC Rules, nor the Uniform Rules specifically set forth procedures or a standard applicable to motions to dismiss, although the FTC Rules and Uniform Rules appear to contemplate such motions. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 16 CFR 3.22(a) (referencing motions to dismiss); 12 CFR 19.5(b)(7) (same). The Bureau has determined that such motions are appropriate and should be provided for in the Rules, but should not serve to delay the proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraphs (c) and (d) govern the filing of motions for summary disposition. They adopt standards similar to those set forth in the Uniform Rules, the SEC Rules, and the FTC Rules for such motions. Any party to a proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition of a proceeding or for partial summary disposition of a proceeding if: (1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and (2) the moving party is entitled to a favorable decision as a matter of law. The motion, which may be filed after a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available for inspection and copying pursuant to § 1081.206, must be accompanied by a statement of the uncontested material facts, a brief, and any documentary evidence in support of the motion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Any party opposing such a motion must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists, supported by the same type of evidence permitted with a motion for summary disposition, and a brief in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate. These paragraphs are modeled after the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.29.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g), motions to dismiss and for summary disposition are subject to a 35-page limit (modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.250(c)), responses to such motions are due within 20 days (modeled on the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.29(b)(1)), and reply briefs are due within five days of the response and shall not exceed 10 pages. Oral argument is permitted at the request of any party or by motion of the hearing officer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (h) provides that the hearing officer must decide a dispositive motion within 30 days of the expiration of the time for filing all oppositions and replies. The Uniform Rules do not set a deadline for a decision on dispositive motions. The FTC Rules provide for the Commission to decide substantive motions within 45 days, 16 CFR 3.22(a), and the SEC Rules state that motions for summary disposition are to be decided “promptly” by the hearing officer, 17 CFR 201.250(b). The Bureau has adopted the 30-day timeframe for decisions on dispositive motions in keeping with its emphasis on expeditious decision-making in administrative proceedings. The Bureau believes that 30 days affords sufficient time for the hearing officer to properly assess the merits of the motion and draft either a ruling denying the motion or a recommended decision granting it.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>If the hearing officer finds that a party is not entitled to dismissal or summary disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying that motion. This ruling would not be subject to interlocutory appeal unless such an appeal was granted pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in § 1081.211. If the hearing officer determines that dismissal or summary adjudication is appropriate, he or she will issue a recommended decision to that effect. If a party, for good cause shown, cannot yet present facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer is to deny or defer the motion.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>This section is modeled primarily after the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.32, which provide for mandatory prehearing submissions by the parties. Section 215 requires that the following documents be served upon the other parties no later than 10 days prior to the start of the hearing: A prehearing statement; a final list of witnesses to be called to testify that includes a description of the expected testimony of each witness; any prior sworn statements that a party intends to admit into evidence pursuant to § 1081.303; a list of exhibits along with a copy of each exhibit; and any stipulations of fact or liability. The failure of a party to comply with this provision will preclude the party from presenting any witnesses or exhibits not listed in its prehearing submission at the hearing, except for good cause shown. To account for cases in which the hearing officer has dispensed with expert discovery, this section also requires that a statement of any expert's qualifications and other information concerning the expert be turned over if it has not been provided pursuant to § 1081.210.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The FTC Rules do not provide for a prehearing submission, and the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.222, do not make such a submission mandatory.

An amicus brief may be allowed when a motion for leave to file the brief has been granted; the brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties; the brief is filed at the request of the Director or the hearing officer, as appropriate; or the brief is presented by the United States or an officer or agency thereof, or by a State (defined to include territories or possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa or any federally recognized Indian tribe), or a political subdivision thereof.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered incorporating other provisions of the SEC Rules regarding participation but decided against doing so. The Bureau believes that allowing intervention by other parties will serve to delay the proceedings with little or no attendant benefit, particularly in light of the allowance for amicus participation. The Bureau has also decided against including a provision providing for the limited participation of federal or state criminal prosecutors for the purpose of seeking stays during the pendency of criminal investigations or prosecutions arising out of the same or similar facts as are at issue in an adjudication proceeding. The Bureau believes that such stays can be appropriately sought by Enforcement Counsel upon request of Federal or state agencies.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.119 Confidential Information; Protective Orders</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section sets forth the means by which a party or another person may seek a protective order shielding confidential information. While generally modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.322, the section adopts the substantive standard set forth in the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.45(b), which provides that the hearing officer may grant a protective order only upon a finding that public disclosure will likely result in a clearly defined, serious injury to the person requesting confidential treatment or after finding that the material constitutes sensitive personal information. The Rule adopts the FTC's standard because it comports with the Bureau's goals of providing as much transparency in the adjudicative process as possible, while also protecting confidential business information or other sensitive information of parties appearing before the Bureau or third parties whose information may be introduced into evidence. The Bureau expects that the standard set forth in this section will be met in cases where the disclosure of trade secrets or other information to the public or to parties is likely to result in harm, but that the standard will not be met simply because the information at issue is deemed “confidential” or “proprietary” by the movant. To the extent that a movant can identify a clearly defined, serious injury likely to result from the disclosure of such particular information, it will be protected; generalized claims of competitive or other injury generally will not suffice.

With regard to time limits for responsive pleadings or papers, the Rules incorporate a three-day extension for mail service, similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and a one-day extension for overnight delivery, as contained in some agencies' existing rules. A one-day extension for service by electronic transmission is consistent with the Uniform Rules and reflects that electronic transmission may result in delays in actual receipt by the person served.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.405 Decision of the Director</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section contains rules regarding the final decision and order of the Director. Paragraph (a) provides for the scope of the Director's review and defines the record before the Director as consisting of all items that were part of the record below in accordance with § 1081.306; any notices of appeal or order directing review; all briefs, motions, submissions, and other papers filed on appeal or review; and the transcript of any oral argument held.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Director may have the advice and assistance of decisional employees in considering and disposing of a case. In rendering a final decision, the Director will affirm, adopt, modify, set aside, or remand for further proceedings the recommended decision and will include in the decision a statement of the reasons or basis for the Director's actions and the findings of fact relied upon.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In accordance with section 1053 of the Act, this section provides that, at the expiration of the time permitted for the filing of reply briefs with the Director, the Executive Secretary will notify the parties that the case has been submitted for final Bureau decision by the Director. The Director will then issue a final decision and order within 90 days of such notification to the parties. This policy ensures a timely final resolution to all administrative adjudications.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Copies of final decisions and orders by the Director will be served on each party, upon other persons required by statute, and, if directed by the Director or required by statute, upon any appropriate state or Federal supervisory authority. The final decision and order will also be published on the Bureau's Web site or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.404 Oral Argument Before the Director</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section adopts the SEC's policy for oral argument on appeal wherein the Director will consider appeals, motions, and other matters on the basis of the papers filed without oral argument unless the Director determines that the presentation of facts and legal arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process would be significantly aided by oral argument. A party who seeks oral argument is directed to indicate such a request on the first page of its opening or answering brief. Oral argument shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the Director.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.407 Effective Date; Stays Pending Judicial Review</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section governs the effective date of the Director's final orders. We have incorporated the requirement in section 1053(b) of the Act that orders to cease and desist shall become effective 30 days after the date of service of the Director's final decision and order.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also contains the rules and procedures regarding stays of Bureau orders. Any party subject to a final order, other than a consent order, may apply to the Director for a stay of all or part of that order pending judicial review. Such a motion must be made within 30 days of service of the Director's final decision and order. A motion for a stay shall address the likelihood of the movant's success on appeal, whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not granted, the degree of injury to other parties if a stay is granted, and why the stay is in the public interest.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, this section adopts the provision from the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.41, providing that the commencement of proceedings for judicial review of a final decision and order of the Director does not, unless specifically ordered by the Director or a reviewing court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Director.</analysisParagraph>

          <analysisParagraph>The Rules relate solely to agency procedure and practice and, thus, are not subject to the notice and comment requirements of the APA. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 5 U.S.C. 553(b). Although the Rules are exempt from these requirements, the Bureau invites comment on them. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2) do not apply.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>2. Section 1022(b)(2) Provisions</title>
          <analysisParagraph>The CFPB has conducted an analysis of benefits, costs, and impacts <footnote ref="3">Section 1022(b)(2)(A) addresses the consideration of the potential benefits and costs of regulation to consumers and industry, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services; the impact of proposed rules on depository institutions and credit unions with $10 billion or less in total assets as described in Section 1026 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and the impact on consumers in rural areas.</footnote>and consulted with the prudential regulators, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, including with respect to whether the Rules are consistent with any relevant prudential, market, and systemic objectives administered by such agencies.<footnote ref="4">The President's July 11, 2011, Executive Order 13579 entitled “Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies,” asks the independent agencies to follow the cost-saving, burden-reducing principles in Executive Order 13563; harmonization and simplification of rules; flexible approaches that reduce costs; and scientific integrity. In the spirit of Executive Order 13563, the CFPB has consulted with the Office of Management and Budget regarding this interim final rule.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concludes that the Rules will benefit consumers and covered persons alike. The Rules do not impose any obligations on consumers or covered persons, nor do they have any direct relevance to consumers' access to consumer financial products and services. Rather, they provide a clear, efficient mechanism for the conduct of adjudication proceedings, which benefits consumers because the Rules offer a systematic process for protecting them from unlawful behavior. The Rules are intended to provide an expeditious decision-making process, which will benefit both consumers and covered persons. The Rules adopt an affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery, pursuant to which the Bureau will make available to respondents the information obtained by the Division of Enforcement from persons not employed by the Bureau prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. This affirmative disclosure obligation substitutes for the traditional civil discovery process, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. The Bureau believes that the Rules, on the whole, will afford covered persons with a relatively inexpensive way to have their cases heard. The Rules are based upon, and drawn from, existing rules of the prudential regulators, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Their grounding in rules likely familiar to practitioners should further reduce the expense of administrative adjudication for covered persons.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Further, the Rules have no unique impact on insured depository institutions or insured credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets described in section 1026(a) of the Act, and do not have a unique impact on rural consumers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection adds part 1081 to 12 CFR Chapter X to read as set forth below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.406 Reconsideration</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section permits parties to file petitions for reconsideration of a final decision and order within 14 days after service of the decision and order. The Bureau has adopted the practice set forth in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.470, pursuant to which no response to a petition for reconsideration will be filed unless requested by the Director, and the Bureau has added a provision providing that the Director will request such a response before granting any motion for reconsideration. This is intended to lessen the burden on prevailing parties while preserving their opportunity to be heard if the Director is considering granting a motion for reconsideration.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.401 Transmission of Documents to Director; Record Index; Certification</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Modeled on the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.38(b) and the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.351(c), this section directs the hearing officer to furnish to the Director a certified index for the case at the same time that the hearing officer files the recommended decision. It also establishes the process by which the record is transmitted to the Director for review on appeal.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.400 Recommended Decision of the Hearing Officer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section adopts the general framework governing decisions by the hearing officer from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360. It provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case within a specified time frame. Unlike the SEC Rule, which provides that the hearing officer will issue an “initial decision,” this section provides that the hearing officer's decision will be a recommended decision to the Director.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also deviates from the SEC model in that it does not provide for multiple “tracks” or timelines, but just one. This section provides that the hearing officer will file a recommended decision in each case no later than 90 days after the deadline for filing post-hearing responsive briefs and in no event later than 300 days after service of the notice of charges. The 300-day timeframe is taken from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360(a)(2), and the 90-day timeframe is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.51(a). Requests by the hearing officer for extensions of this time frame must be made to the Director and will be granted only if the Director determines that additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest. The Bureau anticipates such requests and extensions to be rare. As noted above, this provision was adopted to ensure the timely resolution of adjudication proceedings in light of the experience of other agencies. The Bureau believes that the 90-day and 300-day timelines set forth in this section provide sufficient time for the hearing officer to conduct appropriate proceedings and issue an informed recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Paragraph (c) of this section is modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.360(b), and sets forth the contents of the recommended decision, providing that the recommended decision shall include a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as the reasons or basis therefore, and an appropriate order, sanction, relief or denial thereof. The recommended decision shall also state that a notice of appeal may be filed within 10 days after service of the recommended decision, and shall include a statement that the Director may issue a final decision and order adopting the recommended decision, unless a party timely files and perfects a notice of appeal. The recommended decision shall be filed with the Executive Secretary, who will promptly serve the recommended decision on the parties.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Drawing from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.51(d), paragraph (d) of this section provides that the recommended decision shall be made by the hearing officer who presided over the hearing, except when he or she has become unavailable to the Bureau. Paragraph (e) provides that the hearing officer may reopen proceedings for receipt of further evidence upon a showing of good cause until the close of the hearing record. With the exception of correcting clerical errors or addressing a remand from the Director, the hearing officer's jurisdiction terminates upon the filing of the recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.403 Briefs Filed With the Director</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section outlines the requirements for briefs filed with the Director. Paragraph (a) is modeled on the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.350(b), and governs the content of briefs. Paragraph (b) is also drawn from the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.350(c), and sets forth length limitations for briefs. Unlike the SEC and the FTC, the Bureau has placed page limits—rather than word limits—on briefs. This change is intended to simplify the Rules and place less of a burden upon the parties but should have no substantive impact.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1081.402 Notice of Appeal; Review by the Director</title>
      <analysisParagraph>This section contains the process for review of a recommended decision by the Director. Paragraph (a) is drawn from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.52(b), and states that any party may object to the recommended decision of the hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal to the Director within 10 days of the recommended decision and perfecting that notice of appeal by filing an opening brief within 30 days of the recommended decision. Any party may respond to the opening brief by filing an answering brief within 30 days of service of the opening brief, and reply briefs may be filed within seven days after that. Appeals to the Director are available as of right in all cases where the hearing officer has issued a recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This section also provides that within 40 days after the date of service of the recommended decision, the Director, on his or her own initiative, may order further briefing or argument with respect to any recommended decision or portion of any recommended decision or issue a final decision and order adopting the recommended decision. The 40-day time period is intended to provide the Director with the benefit of knowing whether any party has filed and perfected an appeal before determining whether further briefing and argument regarding a recommended decision is necessary. Any such order shall set forth the scope of further review and the issues that will be considered and will provide for the filing of briefs if the Director deems briefing appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, this section provides that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 704, a perfected appeal to the Director of a recommended decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a final decision and order, unless the Director issues a final decision and order that does not incorporate the recommended decision, in which case judicial review shall be available to the extent that the Director's final decision and order does not adopt the recommended decision.</analysisParagraph>
