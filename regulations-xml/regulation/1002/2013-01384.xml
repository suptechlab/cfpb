            <content>1. This Appendix contains ten sample notification forms. Forms C-1 through C-4 are intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken on an application or account under §§ 1002.9(a)(1) and (2)(i) of this part. Form C-5 is a notice of disclosure of the right to request specific reasons for adverse action under §§ 1002.9(a)(1) and (2)(ii). Form C-6 is designed for use in notifying an applicant, under § 1002.9(c)(2), that an application is incomplete. Forms C-7 and C-8 are intended for use in connection with applications for business credit under § 1002.9(a)(3). Form C-9 is designed for use in notifying an applicant of the right to receive a copy of appraisals under § 1002.14. Form C-10 is designed for use in notifying an applicant for nonmortgage credit that the creditor is requesting applicant characteristic information.</content>

            <content>2. Form C-1 contains the Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure as required by sections 615(a) and (b) of that act. Forms C-2 through C-5 contain only the section 615(a) disclosure (that a creditor obtained information from a consumer reporting agency that was considered in the credit decision). A creditor must provide the section 615(a) disclosure when adverse action is taken against a consumer based on information from a consumer reporting agency. A creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure when adverse action is taken based on information from an outside source other than a consumer reporting agency. In addition, a creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure if the creditor obtained information from an affiliate other than information in a consumer report or other than information concerning the affiliate's own transactions or experiences with the consumer. Creditors may comply with the disclosure requirements for adverse action based on information in a consumer report obtained from an affiliate by providing either the section 615(a) or section 615(b) disclosure. Optional language in Forms C-1 through C-5 may be used to direct the consumer to the entity that provided the credit score for any questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact information. Creditors may use or not use this additional language without losing the safe harbor, since the language is optional.</content>

            <content>3. The sample forms are illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors. They were designed to include some of the factors that creditors most commonly consider. If a creditor chooses to use the checklist of reasons provided in one of the sample forms in this appendix and if reasons commonly used by the creditor are not provided on the form, the creditor should modify the checklist by substituting or adding other reasons. For example, if “inadequate down payment” or “no deposit relationship with us” are common reasons for taking adverse action on an application, the creditor ought to add or substitute such reasons for those presently contained on the sample forms.</content>

            <content>4. If the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. For example, some creditors consider only references from banks or other depository institutions and disregard finance company references altogether; their statement of reasons should disclose “insufficient bank references,” not “insufficient credit references.” Similarly, a creditor that considers bank references and other credit references as distinct factors should treat the two factors separately and disclose them as appropriate. The creditor should either add such other factors to the form or check “other” and include the appropriate explanation. The creditor need not, however, describe how or why a factor adversely affected the application. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”</content>

              <content>The regulation defines a completed <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref> in terms that give a <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> the latitude to establish its own information requirements.

For example, the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> should request information from third parties, such as a <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, promptly after receiving the <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref>.

              <content>The regulation does not specify how often <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> scoring systems must be revalidated. The <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> scoring system must be revalidated frequently enough to ensure that it continues to meet recognized professional statistical standards for statistical soundness. To ensure that predictive ability is being maintained, the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must periodically review the performance of the system. This could be done, for example, by analyzing the loan portfolio to determine the delinquency rate for each score interval, or by analyzing population stability over time to detect deviations of recent <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">applications</ref> from the <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicant</ref> population used to validate the system. If this analysis indicates that the system no longer predicts risk with statistical soundness, the system must be adjusted as necessary to reestablish its predictive ability. A <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s own data.</content>

              <title type="keyterm">Effects test.</title>
              <content>The effects test is a judicial doctrine that was developed in a series of employment cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<ref target="USC:42-2000" reftype="external">42 U.S.C. 2000</ref>e et seq.,) and the burdens of proof for such employment cases were codified by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (<ref target="USC:42-2000" reftype="external">42 U.S.C. 2000</ref>e-2). Congressional intent that this doctrine apply to the <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> area is documented in the Senate Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-589, pp. 4-5; and in the House Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-210, p.5. The <ref target="1002-2-b" reftype="term">Act</ref> and regulation may prohibit a <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> practice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a disproportionately negative impact on a <ref target="1002-2-z" reftype="term">prohibited basis</ref>, even though the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has no intent to discriminate and the practice appears neutral on its face, unless the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> practice meets a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved as well by means that are less disparate in their impact. For example, requiring that <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref> have income in excess of a certain amount to qualify for an overdraft line of <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> could mean that women and minority <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref> will be rejected at a higher rate than men and nonminority <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref>. If there is a demonstrable relationship between the income requirement and creditworthiness for the level of <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> involved, however, use of the income standard would likely be permissible.</content>

                  <content>Some <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> systems segment the population and use different scorecards based on the <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> of an <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicant</ref>. In such a system, one card may cover a narrow <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> range (for example, <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref> in their twenties or younger) who are evaluated under attributes predictive for that <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> group. A second card may cover all other <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref>, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> range that encompasses <ref target="1002-2-o" reftype="term">elderly</ref> <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref>, the <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> scoring system is not deemed to score <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref>. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> of <ref target="1002-2-o" reftype="term">elderly</ref> <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicants</ref>.

                <content>A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives payments from the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date.

A reverse mortgage program that requires borrowers to be <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> 62 or older is permissible under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iii), a <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may consider a borrower's <ref target="1002-2-d" reftype="term">age</ref> to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> or monthly payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.</content>

                <content>The ECOA requires disclosure of the principal reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref> for an <ref target="1002-2-q" reftype="term">extension of credit</ref>. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires a <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to disclose when it has based its decision in whole or in part on information from a source other than the <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicant</ref> or its own files. Disclosing that a <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> report was obtained and used in the denial of the <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref>, as the FCRA requires, does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons. For example, if the <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicant</ref>'s <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> history reveals delinquent <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> obligations and the <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref> is denied for that reason, to satisfy § 1002.9(b)(2) the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must disclose that the <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref> was denied because of the <ref target="1002-2-e" reftype="term">applicant</ref>'s delinquent <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> obligations. The FCRA also requires a <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to disclose, as applicable, a <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> score it used in taking adverse action along with related information, including up to four key factors that adversely affected the consumer's <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> score (or up to five factors if the number of inquiries made with respect to that consumer report is a key factor). Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer's <ref target="1002-2-j" reftype="term">credit</ref> score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an <ref target="1002-2-f" reftype="term">application</ref> or <ref target="1002-2-q" reftype="term">extension of credit</ref>.

A <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s cost may include an administration fee charged to the <ref target="1002-2-l" reftype="term">creditor</ref> by an appraisal management company as defined in <ref target="USC:12-3350" reftype="external">12 U.S.C. 3350</ref>(11).
