            <content>The following are instructions for completing the HUD-1 settlement statement, required under section 4 of RESPA and 12 CFR part 1024 (Regulation X) of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) regulations. This form is to be used as a statement of actual charges and adjustments paid by the borrower and the seller, to be given to the parties in connection with the settlement. The instructions for completion of the HUD-1 are primarily for the benefit of the settlement agents who prepare the statements and need not be transmitted to the parties as an integral part of the HUD-1. There is no objection to the use of the HUD-1 in transactions in which its use is not legally required. Refer to the definitions section of the regulations (12 CFR <ref target="1024-2" reftype="internal">1024.2</ref>) for specific definitions of many of the terms that are used in these instructions.</content>

          <paragraph label="1024-A-h1-p2" marker="">
            <content>Information and amounts may be filled in by typewriter, hand printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and legible results. Refer to the Bureau's regulations (Regulation X) regarding rules applicable to reproduction of the HUD-1 for the purpose of including customary recitals and information used locally in settlements; for example, a breakdown of payoff figures, a breakdown of the Borrower's total monthly mortgage payments, check disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable special stipulations between Borrower and Seller, and the date funds are transferred.</content>
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph label="1024-A-h1-p3" marker="">
            <content>The settlement agent shall complete the HUD-1 to itemize all charges imposed upon the Borrower and the Seller by the loan originator and all sales commissions, whether to be paid at settlement or outside of settlement, and any other charges which either the Borrower or the Seller will pay at settlement. Charges for loan origination and title services should not be itemized except as provided in these instructions. For each separately identified settlement service in connection with the transaction, the name of the person ultimately receiving the payment must be shown together with the total amount paid to such person. Items paid to and retained by a loan originator are disclosed as required in the instructions for lines in the 800-series of the HUD-1 (and for per diem interest, in the 900-series of the HUD-1).</content></paragraph>
          <paragraph label="1024-A-h1-p4" marker="">
            <content>As a general rule, charges that are paid for by the seller must be shown in the seller's column on page 2 of the HUD-1 (unless paid outside closing), and charges that are paid for by the borrower must be shown in the borrower's column (unless paid outside closing). However, in order to promote comparability between the charges on the GFE and the charges on the HUD-1, if a seller pays for a charge that was included on the GFE, the charge should be listed in the borrower's column on page 2 of the HUD-1. That charge should also be offset by listing a credit in that amount to the borrower on lines 204-209 on page 1 of the HUD-1, and by a charge to the seller in lines 506-509 on page 1 of the HUD-1. If a loan originator (other than for no-cost loans), real estate agent, other settlement service provider, or other person pays for a charge that was included on the GFE, the charge should be listed in the borrower's column on page 2 of the HUD-1, with an offsetting credit reported on page 1 of the HUD-1, identifying the party paying the charge.</content>
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph label="1024-A-h1-p5" marker="">
            <content>Charges paid outside of settlement by the borrower, seller, loan originator, real estate agent, or any other person, must be included on the HUD-1 but marked “P.O.C.” for “Paid Outside of Closing” (settlement) and must not be included in computing totals. However, indirect payments from a lender to a mortgage broker may not be disclosed as P.O.C., and must be included as a credit on Line 802. P.O.C. items must not be placed in the Borrower or Seller columns, but rather on the appropriate line outside the columns. The settlement agent must indicate whether P.O.C. items are paid for by the Borrower, Seller, or some other party by marking the items paid for by whoever made the payment as “P.O.C.” with the party making the payment identified in parentheses, such as “P.O.C. (borrower)” or “P.O.C. (seller)”.</content>

          <paragraph label="1024-A-h1-p6" marker="">
            <content>In the case of “no cost” loans where “no cost” encompasses third party fees as well as the upfront payment to the loan originator, the third party services covered by the “no cost” provisions must be itemized and listed in the borrower's column on the HUD-1/1A with the charge for the third party service. These itemized charges must be offset with a negative adjusted origination charge on Line 803 and recorded in the columns.</content>

For example, the balance in the Seller's reserve account held in connection with an existing loan, if assigned to the Borrower in a loan assumption case, will be entered here. These lines will also be used when a tenant in the property being sold has not yet paid the rent, which the Borrower will collect, for a period of time prior to the settlement. The lines will also be used to indicate the treatment for any tenant security deposit. The Seller will be credited on Lines 404-405.</content>

Examples of items for which adjustments will be made may include taxes and assessments paid in advance for an entire year or other period, when settlement occurs prior to the expiration of the year or other period for which they were paid. Additional examples include flood and hazard insurance premiums, if the Borrower is being substituted as an insured under the same policy; mortgage insurance in loan assumption cases; planned unit development or condominium association assessments paid in advance; fuel or other supplies on hand, purchased by the Seller, which the Borrower will use when Borrower takes possession of the property; and ground rent paid in advance.</content>

Lines 204-209 should be used to indicate any financing arrangements or other new loan not listed in Line 202. For example, if the Borrower is using a second mortgage or note to finance part of the purchase price, whether from the same lender, another lender or the Seller, insert the principal amount of the loan with a brief explanation on Lines 204-209. Lines 204-209 should also be used where the Borrower receives a credit from the Seller for closing costs, including seller-paid GFE charges. They may also be used in cases in which a Seller (typically a builder) is making an “allowance” to the Borrower for items that the Borrower is to purchase separately.</content>

The comparison chart is comprised of three sections: “Charges That Cannot Increase”, “Charges That Cannot Increase More Than 10%”, and “Charges That Can Change”.</content>

The instructions for completion of the HUD-1A are for the benefit of the settlement agent who prepares the statement; the instructions are not a part of the statement and need not be transmitted to the borrower.

Line 1601 is used for all settlement charges that both are included in the totals for lines 1400 and 1602, and are not financed as part of the principal amount of the loan. This is the amount normally received by the lender from the borrower at settlement, which would occur when some or all of the settlement charges were paid in cash by the borrower at settlement, instead of being financed as part of the principal amount of the loan.

            <title type="keyterm">Facts:</title>
            <content>A, a real estate broker, obtains all necessary licenses under state law to act as a title insurance agent. A refers individuals who are purchasing homes in transactions in which A participates as a broker to B, an unaffiliated title company, for the purchase of title insurance services. A performs minimal, if any, title services in connection with the issuance of the title insurance policy (such as placing an application with the title company). B pays A a commission (or A retains a portion of the title insurance premium) for the transactions or alternatively B receives a portion of the premium paid directly from the purchaser.</content>

              <content>Comments: The payment of a commission or portion of the title insurance premium by B to A, or receipt of a portion of the payment for title insurance under circumstances where no substantial services are being performed by A, is a violation of section 8 of RESPA. It makes no difference whether the payment comes from B or the purchaser. The amount of the payment must bear a reasonable relationship to the services rendered. Here A really is being compensated for a referral of business to B.</content>

            <title type="keyterm">Facts:</title>
            <content>A is an attorney who, as a part of his legal representation of clients in residential real estate transactions, orders and reviews title insurance policies for his clients. A enters into a contract with B, a title company, to be an agent of B under a program set up by B. Under the agreement, A agrees to prepare and forward title insurance applications to B, to re-examine the preliminary title commitment for accuracy and if he chooses to attempt to clear exceptions to the title policy before closing. A agrees to assume liability for waiving certain exceptions to title, but never exercises this authority. B performs the necessary title search and examination work, determines insurability of title, prepares documents containing substantive information in title commitments, handles closings for A's clients and issues title policies. A receives a fee from his client for legal services and an additional fee for his title agent “services” from the client's title insurance premium to B.</content>
            <paragraph label="1024-B-4-p1" marker="">
              <content>Comments: A and B are violating section 8 of RESPA. Here, A's clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a “title agent” is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services for which he assumes liability, and which includes at a minimum, the evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the title company. A may not be compensated for the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the referral of settlement service business, it has violated section 8 of RESPA.</content>

            <content>A, a “mortgage originator,” receives loan applications, funds the loans with its own money or with a wholesale line of credit for which A is liable, and closes the loans in A's own name. Subsequently, B, a mortgage lender, purchases the loans and compensates A for the value of the loans, as well as for any mortgage servicing rights.</content>
            <paragraph label="1024-B-5-p1" marker="">
              <content>Comments: Compensation for the sale of a mortgage loan and servicing rights constitutes a secondary market transaction, rather than a referral fee, and is beyond the scope of section 8 of RESPA. For purposes of section 8, in determining whether a bona fide transfer of the loan obligation has taken place, the Bureau examines the real source of funding, and the real interest of the named settlement lender.</content>

            <content>A, a credit reporting company, places a facsimile transmission machine (FAX) in the office of B, a mortgage lender, so that B can easily transmit requests for credit reports and A can respond.

            <paragraph label="1024-B-6-p1" marker="">
              <content>Comments: Either situation violates section 8 of RESPA. The FAX machine is a thing of value that A provides in exchange for the referral of business from B.

            <content>A, a real estate broker, refers title business to B, a company that is a licensed title agent for C, a title insurance company. A owns more than 1% of B. B performs the title search and examination, makes determinations of insurability, issues the commitment, clears underwriting objections, and issues a policy of title insurance on behalf of C, for which C pays B a commission. B pays annual dividends to its owners, including A, based on the relative amount of business each of its owners refers to B.</content>
            <paragraph label="1024-B-7-p1" marker="">
              <content>Comments: The facts involve an affiliated business arrangement. The payment of a commission by C to B is not a violation of section 8 of RESPA if the amount of the commission constitutes reasonable compensation for the services performed by B for C. The payment of a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners, such arrangements would violate section 8. The exemption for controlled business arrangements would not be available because the payments here would not be considered returns on ownership interests. Further, the required disclosure of the affiliated business arrangement and estimated charges have not been provided.</content>

            <content>A is a dealer in home improvements who has established funding arrangements with several lenders. Customers for home improvements receive a proposed contract from A. The proposal requires that customers both execute forms authorizing a credit check and employment verification, and frequently, execute a dealer consumer credit contract secured by a lien on the customer's (borrower's) 1- to 4-family residential property. Simultaneously with the completion and certification of the home improvement work, the note is assigned by the dealer to a funding lender.</content>
            <paragraph label="1024-B-14-p1" marker="">
              <content>Comments. The loan that is assigned to the funding lender is a loan covered by RESPA, when a lien is placed on the borrower's 1- to 4-family residential structure. The dealer loan or consumer credit contract originated by a dealer is also a RESPA-covered transaction, except when the dealer is not a “creditor” under the definition of “federally related mortgage loan” in § <ref target="1024-2" reftype="internal">1024.2</ref>. The lender to whom the loan will be assigned is responsible for assuring that the lender or the dealer delivers to the borrower a Good Faith Estimate of closing costs consistent with Regulation X, and that the HUD-1 or HUD-1A Settlement Statement is used in conjunction with the settlement of the loan to be assigned. A dealer who, under § <ref target="1024-2" reftype="internal">1024.2</ref>, is covered by RESPA as a creditor is responsible for the Good Faith Estimate of Closing Costs and the use of the appropriate settlement statement in connection with the loan.</content>

              <content>“ Using the tradeoff table. ”—This section is designed to make borrowers aware of the relationship between their total estimated settlement charges on one hand, and the interest rate and resulting monthly payment on the other hand. The loan originator must complete the left hand column using the loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment figure, and the total estimated settlement charges from page 1 of the GFE. The loan originator, at its option, may provide the borrower with the same information for two alternative loans, one with a higher interest rate, if available, and one with a lower interest rate, if available, from the loan originator. The loan originator should list in the tradeoff table only alternative loans for which it would presently issue a GFE based on the same information the loan originator considered in issuing this GFE. The alternative loans must use the same loan amount and be otherwise identical to the loan in the GFE. The alternative loans must have, for example, the identical number of payment periods; the same margin, index, and adjustment schedule if the loans are adjustable rate mortgages; and the same requirements for prepayment penalty and balloon payments. If the loan originator fills in the tradeoff table, the loan originator must show the borrower the loan amount, alternative interest rate, alternative monthly payment, the change in the monthly payment from the loan in this GFE to the alternative loan, the change in the total settlement charges from the loan in this GFE to the alternative loan, and the total settlement charges for the alternative loan. If these options are available, an applicant may request a new GFE, and a new GFE must be provided by the loan originator.</content>

        <content>A bona fide transfer of a loan obligation in the secondary market is not covered by RESPA and this part, except with respect to RESPA (<ref target="USC:12-2605" reftype="external">12 U.S.C. 2605</ref>) and subpart C of this part (§§ <ref target="1024-30" reftype="internal">1024.30</ref>- <ref target="1024-41" reftype="internal">1024.41</ref>). In determining what constitutes a bona fide transfer, the Bureau will consider the real source of funding and the real interest of the funding lender. Mortgage broker transactions that are table-funded are not secondary market transactions. Neither the creation of a dealer loan or dealer consumer credit contract, nor the first assignment of such loan or contract to a lender, is a secondary market transaction (see § <ref target="1024-2" reftype="internal">1024.2</ref>).</content>

These facts may be used as evidence of a violation of section 8 and may serve as a basis for a RESPA investigation. High prices standing alone are not proof of a RESPA violation. The value of a referral (i.e., the value of any additional business obtained thereby) is not to be taken into account in determining whether the payment exceeds the reasonable value of such goods, facilities or services.

              <content>This section sets out the requirements for an escrow account that a lender establishes in connection with a federally related mortgage loan. It sets limits for escrow accounts using calculations based on monthly payments and disbursements within a calendar year. If an escrow account involves biweekly or any other payment period, the requirements in this section shall be modified accordingly. A Public Guidance Document entitled “Biweekly Payments—Example” provides examples of biweekly accounting and a Public Guidance Document entitled “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example” provides examples of a 3-year accounting cycle that may be used in accordance with paragraph <ref target="1024-17-c-9" reftype="internal">(c)(9)</ref> of this section. A Public Guidance Document entitled “Consumer Disclosure for Voluntary Escrow Account Payments” provides a model disclosure format that originators and servicers are encouraged, but not required, to provide to consumers when the originator or servicer anticipates a substantial increase in disbursements from the escrow account after the first year of the loan. The disclosures in that model format may be combined with or included in the Initial Escrow Account Statement required in § <ref target="1024-17-g" reftype="internal">1024.17(g)</ref>.</content>

To the extent a servicer can reasonably identify a valid information request in a submission that is otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome, the servicer shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs <ref target="1024-36-c" reftype="internal">(c)</ref> and <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">(d)</ref> of this section with respect to that requested information.</content>

            <content>A request for an official interpretation shall be in writing and addressed to the Associate Director, Research, Markets, and Regulations, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552. A request shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts concerning the issue, including copies of all pertinent documents. Except in unusual circumstances, such official interpretations will not be issued separately but will be incorporated in the official commentary to this part, which will be amended periodically.

            <title type="keyterm">Rules of construction.</title>
            <content>(a) Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including, but not limited to,” “among other things,” “for example,” or “such as.”
	            (b) Throughout the commentary, reference to “this section” or “this paragraph” means the section or paragraph in the regulation that is the subject of the comment.</content>

            <content>Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that the comment interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § <ref target="1024-37-c-1" reftype="internal">1024.37(c)(1)</ref> are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment <ref target="1024-37-c-1-i-Interp-1" reftype="internal">37(c)(1)(i)-1</ref>. In other cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for example, as comment <ref target="1024-40-a-Interp-1" reftype="internal">40(a)-1</ref>. This introduction may be cited as comments I-1 through I-5.</content>

              <content>A notice of error is submitted by a borrower if the notice of error is submitted by an agent of the borrower. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf.

              <content>A servicer should not rely solely on the borrower's description of a submission to determine whether the submission constitutes a notice of error under § <ref target="1024-35-a" reftype="internal">1024.35(a)</ref>, an information request under § <ref target="1024-36-a" reftype="internal">1024.36(a)</ref>, or both. For example, a borrower may submit a letter that claims to be a “Notice of Error” that indicates that the borrower wants to receive the information set forth in an annual escrow account statement and asserts an error for the servicer's failure to provide the borrower an annual escrow statement. Such a letter may constitute an information request under § <ref target="1024-36-a" reftype="internal">1024.36(a)</ref> that triggers an obligation by the servicer to provide an annual escrow statement. A servicer should not rely on the borrower's characterization of the letter as a “Notice of Error,” but must evaluate whether the letter fulfills the substantive requirements of a notice of error, information request, or both.</content>

              <content>An information request is submitted by a borrower if the information request is submitted by an agent of the borrower. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat the request for information as having been submitted by the borrower.</content></interpParagraph>

              <content> A servicer complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to an information request for the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan by identifying the person on whose behalf the servicer receives payments from the borrower. Although investors or guarantors, including among others the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association, may be exposed to risks related to the mortgage loans held by a trust either in connection with an investment in securities issued by the trust or the issuance of a guaranty agreement to the trust, such investors or guarantors are not the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans solely as a result of their roles as such. In certain circumstances, however, a party such as a guarantor may assume multiple roles for a securitization transaction. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association may act as trustee, master servicer, and guarantor in connection with a securitization transaction in which a trust owns a mortgage loan subject to a request. In this example, because the Federal National Mortgage Association is the trustee of the trust that owns the mortgage loan, a servicer complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by providing the name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association as the trustee. The following examples identify the owner or assignee for different forms of mortgage loan ownership:</content><interpParagraph label="1024-36-a-Interp-2-i" marker="i.">
                <content>A servicer services a mortgage loan that is owned by the servicer, or an affiliate of the servicer, in portfolio. The servicer therefore receives the borrower's payments on behalf of itself or its affiliate. A servicer complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan with the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the servicer or the affiliate, as applicable.</content>

                <content>A servicer services a mortgage loan that has been securitized. In general, in a securitization transaction, a special purpose vehicle, such as a trust, is the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Thus, the servicer receives the borrower's payments on behalf of the trust. If a securitization transaction is structured such that a trust is the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan and the trust is administered by an appointed trustee, a servicer complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by providing the borrower with the name of the trust and the name, address, and appropriate contract information for the trustee. Assume, for example, a mortgage loan is owned by Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, for which XYZ Trust Company is the trustee. The servicer complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by identifying the owner as Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, and providing the name, address, and appropriate contact information for XYZ Trust Company as the trustee.</content>

For purposes of responding to a borrower's inquiries and assisting a borrower with loss mitigation options, the term “borrower” includes a person authorized by the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example by requiring that a person who claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf.</content></interpParagraph>

      <title>20(a)(1)</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Scope of Requirement</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, new RESPA section 5(c) requires lenders to include a list of homeownership counselors located in the area of the lender with the home buying information booklet that is to be distributed to applicants. To implement RESPA section 5(c), the Bureau proposed in § 1024.20(a)(1) that the list of homeownership counselors or counseling agencies be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans, except for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.20(c) below. Under RESPA and its implementing regulations, a federally related mortgage loan includes purchase-money mortgage loans, subordinate-lien mortgages, refinancings, closed-end home-equity mortgage loans, HELOCs, and reverse mortgages.
          <footnote ref="26">12 U.S.C. 2602(1); 12 CFR 1024.2.</footnote>
          Thus, proposed § 1024.20(a)(1) would have required that lenders provide the list of homeownership counselors to applicants for numerous types of federally related mortgage loans beyond purchase-money mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal, based on its reading of section 5 of RESPA as amended, and its understanding of the purposes of that section, the Bureau believes that the amendments to RESPA indicate that Congress intended the booklet and list of counselors to be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans and not just purchase-money mortgage loans. The Bureau acknowledged that section 5(d) of RESPA, in language that was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires lenders to provide the home buying information booklet “to each person from whom [the lender] receives or for whom it prepares a written application to borrow money to finance the purchase of residential real estate.” However, the Bureau also noted that RESPA sections 5(a) and (b), as amended, indicate that the booklet and list of counselors are to be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans. Section 5(a) as amended (1) specifically references helping consumers applying for federally related mortgage loans understand the nature and costs of real estate settlement services; and (2) directs the Bureau to distribute the booklet and the lists of housing counselors to lenders that make federally related mortgage loans. Moreover, the prescribed content of the booklet is not limited to information on purchase-money mortgages. Under RESPA section 5(b), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the booklet must include information specific to refinancings and HELOCs, as well as “the costs incident to a real estate settlement or a federally related mortgage loan.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal its view that a trained counselor can be useful to any consumer considering any type of mortgage loan. Mortgage transactions beyond purchase-money transactions, such as refinancings and open-end home-secured credit transactions, can entail significant risks and costs for consumers—risks and costs that a trained homeownership counselor can assist consumers in fully understanding.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, for the reasons noted above, the Bureau proposed in § 1024.20(a)(1) to interpret the scope of the homeownership counselor list requirement to apply to all federally related mortgage loans pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, which provides the Bureau with the authority to “prescribe such rules and regulations, to make such interpretations, and to grant such reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions, as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of the [RESPA].”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment from the public on the costs and benefits of the provision of the list of homeownership counselors to applicants for refinancings and HELOCs. The Bureau also sought comment on the potential effect of the Bureau's proposal on access to homeownership counseling generally by consumers, and the effect of increased consumer demand on existing counseling resources. In particular, the Bureau solicited comment on the effect on counseling resources of providing the list beyond applicants for purchase-money mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters stated that lenders should not be required to provide counselor lists to applicants for refinancings or HELOCs. One large bank commenter, for example, asserted that the congressional intent to limit the requirement to purchase-money mortgages is clear. Some other commenters were concerned that applicants for refinancings or HELOCs would either ignore the list or be offended by the suggestion that they would benefit from counseling, because such applicants already understand how mortgages work. Comments from consumer groups and a State Attorney General's office, however, supported the requirement to provide the counselor list to applicants for refinancings and HELOCs. Such commenters noted, for example, that consumers may find themselves in financial distress only after tapping into their home equity through a refinancing or a HELOC, in some cases repeatedly.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is generally finalizing in § 1024.20(a)(1) the requirement to provide a list of counseling providers to applicants of federally related mortgage loans as proposed, for the reasons noted above. The Bureau continues to believe that the statutory language as a whole indicates Congress's intent to require lenders to provide the counselor list to applicants of refinancings and HELOCs, as well as purchase-money mortgages. Moreover, the Bureau agrees with commenters that suggest applicants for refinancings or HELOCs may benefit from information about counseling, even though such applicants have previously obtained a mortgage. The Bureau is, however, also adopting certain exemptions from the requirement, as described in the discussion of § 1024.20(c) below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Content of List</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, RESPA section 5(c) requires that the list of homeownership counselors be comprised of homeownership counselors certified pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 and located in the area of the lender. RESPA section 5(c) does not specify any particular information about homeownership counselors that must be provided on the required list. Proposed § 1024.20(a)(1) would have provided that the list include five homeownership counselors or homeownership counseling organizations located in the zip code of the applicant's current address or, if there were not the requisite five counselors or counseling organizations in that zip code, counselors or organizations within the zip code or zip codes closest to the loan applicant's current address. Proposed § 1024.20(a)(2) would have required lenders to include in the list only homeownership counselors or counseling organizations from either the most current list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations made available by the Bureau for use by lenders in complying with § 1024.20, or the most current list maintained by HUD of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations certified or otherwise approved by HUD. Proposed § 1024.20(a)(3) would have required that the list include: (1) Each counselor's or counseling organization's name, business address, telephone number and, if available from the Bureau or HUD, other contact information; and (2) contact information for the Bureau and HUD.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau stated in the preamble of the proposal that it expected to develop a Web site portal to facilitate compliance with the counselor list requirement. As the Bureau explained, such a Web site portal would allow lenders to type in the loan applicant's zip code to generate the requisite list, which could then be printed for distribution to the loan applicant. The Bureau also stated its belief that such an approach: (1) Could significantly mitigate any paperwork burden associated with requiring that the list be distributed to applicants for federally related mortgage loans; and (2) is consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act's amendment to section 5(a) of RESPA requiring the Bureau to distribute to lenders “lists, organized by location, of homeownership counselors certified under section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) for use in complying with the requirement under [section 5(c)].”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment on the appropriate number of counselors or organizations to be included on the list and on whether there should be a limitation on the number of counselors from the same counseling agency. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether its planned Web site portal would be useful and whether there are other mechanisms through which the Bureau can help facilitate compliance and provide lists to lenders and consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A significant number of industry commenters objected to the proposed requirement to create individualized lists for borrowers as overly burdensome. Some commenters raised concerns that having to create these individualized lists would expose them to risk in the event of an error in compiling the list. Many industry commenters suggested that lenders should instead be permitted to comply with the requirement by providing Bureau and HUD contact information for the consumer to obtain information about counselors. Other commenters suggested it would be more beneficial to refer consumers to web databases containing all counselors in a state, or to provide a list based on an applicant's state rather than zip code. Commenters argued that changing the provision to allow compliance through a static list would minimize costs, create greater efficiency, and be more accurate. Some commenters argued that locating the nearest zip code to a consumer's home zip code would be overly burdensome. Several commenters objected to the requirement that the list be obtained from “the most current” lists of counselors or counseling organizations maintained by the Bureau or HUD, or suggested that “most current” should mean “monthly.” A number of consumer group commenters, however, supported the requirement for an individualized list because such a list would be most beneficial to consumers. One such commenter also noted that requiring lenders to retrieve a fresh list for each applicant will ensure the lists received by consumers are the most up-to-date.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters were generally very supportive of the Bureau's intention to create a Web site portal to facilitate compliance, particularly if the individualized list requirement were retained. Some industry commenters noted that the list requirement would not be difficult to comply with as proposed, if a Web site portal were available. A few commenters, while primarily supportive of a requirement to provide a static rather than an individualized list, alternatively favored the idea of the Web site portal to generate the list (including automatically selecting adjacent zip codes to an applicant's zip code, if necessary). Some commenters requested a safe harbor for lenders providing a list generated through the Web site portal. Commenters proposed a number of additions or variations to the Web site portal. A number of industry commenters stated the Bureau should provide lenders with the option to import the data from the Web site portal directly into their systems, to ease compliance burden. Several industry commenters noted it would be essential that the Web site portal generate a list for lenders based on a simple zip code query. A few commenters suggested that the Web site portal should provide a randomized list in response to a zip code query, to avoid favoritism. Some commenters suggested the Web site portal should be made available to the public and publicized by the Bureau (e.g.,though a public campaign in coordination with homeownership counseling organizations, counseling trade groups, and HUD), and that lenders should be required to make lists available through their Web sites, branch offices, and mortgage advertising. Several commenters stated that the Bureau should coordinate the development of its Web site portal with HUD, so lenders are not required to search two separate databases.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters raised concerns about the requirement to provide a list of five counselors or counseling agencies, asserting that five is an arbitrary number and that it would be a difficult requirement to meet in certain geographic locations. Some commenters noted, for example, that Alaska has only three counseling agencies statewide, and that Wyoming has only four. One commenter suggested that lenders should not have to disclose counselors from different states, if there are not five counselors in the consumer's state. A few commenters suggested that the requirement be more flexible and require, for example, a list of “no fewer than three” counseling agencies.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer advocacy and housing counselor advocacy groups commented that only homeownership counseling agencies, rather than individual homeownership counselors, should be permitted to appear on the list. These commenters noted that providing a list of individual counselors to consumers is neither practical nor efficient, as an individual counselor may not be available. A few commenters suggested that the list include agencies offering remote counseling services. For example, an alliance of counseling organizations suggested the list be required to include a minimum number of national counseling agencies or intermediaries
          <footnote ref="27">National intermediary organizations generally provide funding, training, and oversight of affiliated local counseling agencies, but may also provide counseling services directly to consumers. Christopher E. Herbert et al., Abt Assoc. Inc.,The State of the Housing Counseling Industry,at xi, 2 (U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. 2008).</footnote>
          outside of a consumer's zip code that can provide phone counseling.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer advocacy and housing counselor advocacy commenters requested that additional information be required to be provided on the list. For example, they asked that the lists be required to include a counseling agency's specialty (e.g.,pre-purchase, refinance, home equity, rental, reverse mortgage, etc.) and any foreign language capacity. Another commenter requested that the list include a description of the services that the counselor would provide and fees typically charged for such services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received concerning compliance burden and the potential operational difficulties associated with developing lists as envisioned in the proposal, the Bureau is revising § 1024.20(a)(1) to require lenders to fulfill the list obligation through use of either a Bureau Web site or data made available by the Bureau or HUD. Specifically, final § 1024.20(a)(1) allows lenders to distribute lists of counseling organizations providing relevant counseling services in the applicant's location that are obtained up to 30 days in advance from either a Web site maintained by the Bureau or data made available by the Bureau or HUD for lenders to use in complying with the requirements of § 1024.20, provided that the data are used in accordance with instructions provided with the data. Because lenders will thus generate the required lists through either a Web site that will automatically provide the required content of the list based on certain inputs, or through data that is accompanied by instructions to generate lists consistent with the Web site, the final rule also eliminates proposed § 1024.20(a)(1)(i) and (ii) and proposed § 1024.20(a)(2) and (3) as unnecessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau intends to create a Web site portal, in close coordination with HUD, that will require lenders to input certain required information (such as, for example, the applicant's zip code and the type of mortgage product) in order to generate a list of homeownership counseling organizations that provide relevant counseling services in the loan applicant's location. While the Bureau understands the concerns raised by commenters about the burden of generating zip-code based lists for potential borrowers, the Bureau notes that the statutory requirement indicates that the list should be comprised of counselors “located in the area of the lender.” The Bureau is interpreting this requirement to mean the location of the applicant who is being served by the lender. The Bureau continues to believe that a list of counseling resources available near the applicant's location will be most useful to the applicant.<footnote ref="28">
          The Bureau also relies on its exemption and modification authority under RESPA section 19(a) and the Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b). The Bureau believes that interpreting “located in the area of the lender” to mean the location of the applicant who is being served by the lender will help facilitate the effective functioning of this new RESPA disclosure. It will also, therefore, help carry out the purposes of RESPA for more effective advance cost disclosures for consumers, by providing information to loan applicants regarding counseling resources available for assisting them in understanding their prospective mortgage loans and settlement costs. In addition, because the Bureau believes that lists organized by the location of the applicant will be most useful to the applicants, the Bureau believes this interpretation is in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.
          </footnote>
          The Bureau also believes that permitting lists to be generated based on larger geographic areas, such as an applicant's state, would frequently result in an applicant receiving a list that is overwhelmingly lengthy. The Bureau notes, for example, that HUD's Web site indicates that there are a significant number of states that are served by well over 20 homeownership counseling organizations. The Bureau notes, moreover, that the Web site portal will obviate the need for a lender to determine the closest zip codes to an applicant.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the concerns of industry commenters that requiring greater data inputs from lenders to generate a list will increase the burden on the lender. The Bureau intends to require as few data inputs as practicable to generate a relevant list for the applicant, in order to minimize compliance burden. The Bureau agrees with commenters that the Web site portal it develops should be made directly available to consumers, and the Bureau does intend to publicize the Web site portal to make consumers better aware of the counseling resources available.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also agrees with commenters who suggested the list should include only homeownership counseling organizations rather than individual counselors. The Bureau explained in the preamble of the proposal that it was proposing to allow the list to include counselors or counseling organizations certified or otherwise approved by HUD, pursuant to its exemption authority under section 19(a) of RESPA and its modification authority under section 1405(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.20(a)(1) to require that the list contain only counseling organizations, pursuant to the same exemption authority, and anticipates that the Web site portal it develops may generate lists that include counseling organizations that are either certified or otherwise approved by HUD.<footnote ref="29">
          As the Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal, the Bureau understands that HUD, other than for its counseling program for HECMs, currently only approves homeownership counseling agencies, rather than certifying these agencies or individual counselors, as it has not yet implemented section 1445 of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding certification of counseling providers. The Bureau also notes that permitting the list to include individual counselors could cause confusion for consumers, as an individual counselor may be unavailable. The Bureau is therefore exercising its exemption and modification authority under RESPA section 19(a) and the Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to provide flexibility in order to facilitate the availability of competent counseling organizations for placement on the lists, so that counseling organizations that are either approved or certified by HUD may appear on the lists. Permitting the list to include HUD-approved or HUD-certified counseling organizations will help facilitate the effective functioning of this new RESPA disclosure. It will also, therefore, help carry out the purposes of RESPA for more effective advance cost disclosures for consumers, by providing information to loan applicants regarding counseling resources available for assisting them in understanding their prospective mortgage loans and settlement costs. The Bureau intends to work closely with HUD to facilitate operational coordination and consistency between the counseling and certification requirements HUD puts into place and the lists generated by the Bureau's Web site portal.
          </footnote>
          Because the Web site portal will automatically create lists that include the relevant homeownership counseling organizations, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed § 1024.20(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that allowing lenders to obtain the list up to 30 days prior to providing it to the loan applicant strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring the information received by consumers is useful, and avoiding unnecessary burdens on lenders. The Bureau notes a lender may be able to keep counselor lists generated based on certain data inputs on file, and provide those stored lists to applicants as appropriate for up to 30 days, in order to avoid generating a new list for each applicant.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the information that will appear on the lists of counseling organizations, the Bureau notes that rather than specify particular information, such as the counseling organization's telephone number, that must appear on the list through regulation, the Bureau will design its Web site portal so that the appropriate information will automatically appear on the lists that are generated. The Bureau will also work to ensure that any data provided for compliance with the requirement is accompanied by instructions that will result in the creation of a list that is consistent with what would have been generated if the Web site portal had been used. Accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed § 1024.20(a)(3). The Bureau believes this will help ease compliance burden. The Bureau anticipates that the lists generated through its Web site portal or in accordance with its instructions will include contact information for the counseling organizations and may include additional information about the counseling organizations such as language capacity and areas of expertise. The Bureau also anticipates that the lists generated through its Web site portal will also include information enabling the consumer to access either the Bureau or the HUD list of homeownership counseling organizations, so that an applicant who receives the list can obtain information about additional counseling organizations if desired.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Timing of the List</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, RESPA section 5(c) requires that the list be included with the home buying information booklet that is to be distributed to applicants no later than three business days after the lender receives a loan application. Proposed § 1024.20(a)(1) would have required a lender to provide the list no later than three business days after the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer receives an application (or information sufficient to complete an application). The definition of “application” that would have applied appears in § 1024.2(b). The Bureau noted in the proposal that its 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal proposed to adopt a new definition of “application” under Regulation Z, and it sought comment on whether to tie the provision of the list to this proposed definition instead of the definition in § 1024.2(b). Some industry commenters asked for greater flexibility with respect to the timing of the list requirement, so that a list could be provided later than three business days after the lender receives a loan application. A few consumer groups and a counseling association commenter objected to the timing of the list requirement on the basis that counseling should occur earlier in the shopping process, not at application. The Bureau received one comment in support of linking the timing requirement for the list with the good faith estimate required by RESPA. A few commenters noted that regardless of whether the list had to be provided at the same time as the RESPA good faith estimate, it should only have to be provided once per loan, even if a loan estimate had to be revised.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the counselor list should be provided no later than the same time period as other applicable disclosures, in order to be most beneficial to consumers. The Bureau agrees with consumer group commenters that obtaining information about counseling at a point earlier than application could be beneficial to consumers. The Bureau notes, however, that the statutory requirement provides that the list of homeownership counselors be provided with the home buying booklet. The Bureau agrees with commenters that stated a lender should only be required to provide a single list in conjunction with an application, and notes that the final rule does not require that more than one list be provided. In addition, because the Bureau has not yet finalized the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal, the Bureau declines to provide a different definition of application in the final rule. The Bureau is therefore finalizing the timing requirement in § 1024.20(a)(1) as proposed, consistent with the timing requirement of the booklet.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Under RESPA section 5(c), a lender must provide a list of homeownership counselors to an applicant. To afford flexibility and help ease compliance burden, proposed § 1024.20(a)(5) would have allowed a mortgage broker or dealer to provide the list to those applicants from whom it receives or for whom it prepares applications. Under proposed § 1024.20(a)(5), where a mortgage broker or dealer provides the list, the lender is not required to provide an additional list but remains responsible for ensuring that the list has been provided to the loan applicant and satisfies the requirements of proposed § 1024.20.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received one comment objecting to the language that a mortgage broker or dealer “may” provide the list to a loan applicant from whom it receives for whom it prepares an application. This commenter suggested that this language be changed to “must,” to reflect that mortgage brokers and dealers are required to provide the list to their loan applicants.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above however, under the language of proposed § 1024.20(a)(5) the lender would have been responsible for ensuring that the list of counseling organizations is provided to the loan applicant in accordance with the requirements of § 1024.20(a)(5). As a result, the provision would have required that a loan applicant receive the list, with the lender maintaining ultimate responsibility for ensuring that it is provided, regardless of who provides the list.

      <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 5(c) does not specify how the required list must be delivered. Proposed § 1024.20(a)(6) would have set out the requirements for providing the list to the loan applicant,i.e.,in person, by mail, or by other means of delivery. As proposed, the list could have been provided to the loan applicant in electronic form, subject to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters asserted that because the list requirement permits electronic delivery under the E-Sign Act, the list should not be referred to as “written.” One consumer group commenter encouraged the Bureau to remove language permitting the electronic delivery of disclosures, arguing that this could lead to a greater chance the disclosure would not be received (e.g.,if the lender used the incorrect email address).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the requirement that the list be “written” conflicts with the provisions relating to delivery in electronic form pursuant to the E-Sign Act. In fact, the E-Sign Act itself specifically provides that the use of an electronic record to provide information can satisfy a requirement that certain information required to be made available to a consumer be provided in writing, subject to consumer consent provisions.<footnote ref="30">

      <title>20(c)(1) Reverse Mortgage Transactions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 5(c) requires lenders to include a list of homeownership counselors with the home buying information booklet that is to be distributed to applicants. As noted above, the Bureau generally proposed in § 1024.20(a)(1) to interpret the scope of the homeownership counselor list requirement to apply to applicants of all federally related mortgage loans pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA. Proposed § 1024.20(c) would have exempted a lender from providing an applicant for a HECM, as that type of reverse mortgage is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1715z-20(b)(3), with the list required by § 1024.20 if the lender is otherwise required by HUD to provide a list, and does provide a list, of HECM counselors or counseling agencies to the loan applicant. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z, § 1026.34(a)(5), the Bureau's final pre-loan counseling requirement for high-cost mortgages, Federal law currently requires homeowners to receive counseling before obtaining a HECM reverse mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),<footnote ref="31">
        12 U.S.C. 1715z-20(d)(2)(B).
        </footnote>
        which is a part of HUD. HUD imposes various requirements related to HECM counseling, including requiring FHA-approved HECM mortgagees to provide HECM applicants with a list of HUD-approved HECM counseling agencies. The Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal its concern that a duplicative list requirement could cause confusion for consumers and unnecessary burden for lenders. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to exercise its exemption authority under RESPA section 19(a) to allow lenders that provide a list under HUD's HECM program to satisfy the requirements of § 1024.20.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A trade association for the reverse mortgage industry argued that lenders should not be obligated to provide a counselor list to applicants for HECM mortgages through § 1024.20. This commenter stated that HECM lenders are already required to provide a lengthier list of counselors specializing in reverse mortgage counseling. The commenter pointed out that in most instances a HECM lender cannot even complete a HECM application until they receive a HECM counseling certificate, except in limited circumstances under which HECM applicants can waive counseling requirements (e.g.,for some types of refinancings from a HECM to another HECM). The commenter also argued that lenders should not have to provide applicants for non-HECM reverse mortgages the counseling list if the lender meets the HECM counseling disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that lenders should not have to provide a list of counselors to HECM applicants because the list is of limited value for such applicants, given that the majority of such applicants would already have been required to receive counseling prior to submitting an application for a HECM. In addition, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that lenders should not have to provide applicants for any reverse mortgages subject to Regulation Z § 1026.33(a) with a list of housing counselors. Given that counseling for HECMs and other reverse mortgages is typically provided by specially trained counselors, the Bureau believes that any additional counseling requirements related to these products would be better addressed separately. As noted above, HECM mortgagees are already required to provide HECM applicants with a list of HUD-approved HECM counseling agencies. The Bureau notes that it anticipates undertaking a rulemaking in the future to address how title XIV requirements apply to reverse mortgages and to consider other consumer protection issues in the reverse mortgage market.<footnote ref="32">
        Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Reverse Mortgage Report, at 10-11 (June 2012),available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/documents/201206_cfpb_Reverse_Mortgage_Report.pdf.
        </footnote>
        That rulemaking will provide an opportunity to consider further issues related to counseling or counseling information on reverse mortgages. Because the Bureau concludes that requiring lenders to provide a list of counselors to reverse mortgage borrowers under § 1024.20 is largely duplicative of HECM requirements and may not provide additional, useful information for borrowers of other types of reverse mortgages, final § 1024.20(c)(1) provides an exemption for reverse mortgages pursuant to the Bureau's authority under RESPA section 19(a).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>20(c)(2) Timeshare Plans</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau generally proposed in § 1024.20(a)(1) to interpret the scope of the homeownership counselor list requirement to apply to applicants of all federally related loans pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, which would include applicants for a mortgage secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare. The Bureau did not propose any type of exemption from the list requirement for this category of applicants. Timeshare industry commenters argued that the requirement for a list of counselors should not apply to lenders receiving an application for a mortgage secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare. They asserted an exception is warranted for mortgages secured by timeshares because of their belief that there was no Congressional intent to require counseling for timeshare buyers due to unique characteristics of the timeshare industry, the lack of predatory lending in this market, the lower risk to consumers associated with default of a mortgage secured by a timeshare,<footnote ref="33">
        Commenters stated that typically if a consumer defaults, the only consequence is that the consumer loses the timeshare interest.
        </footnote>
        the protections provided by State law, and the timeshare business model that relies upon purchase and financing documents being executed simultaneously.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that lenders should not be obligated to provide a list of homeownership counselors to applicants for mortgages secured by a timeshare, and is therefore exercising its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to provide an exemption for these transactions in final § 1024.20(c)(2). Although the Bureau believes that some form of counseling may be beneficial to such consumers, the Bureau is concerned that counselors at counseling agencies approved by HUD to counsel consumers on standard mortgage financing may not be trained to provide useful counseling addressing timeshare purchases. For that reason, the Bureau is concerned that the benefit of the list of counselors to a consumer purchasing a timeshare could be quite low. The Bureau has therefore determined that exempting timeshare purchases from the list requirement is reasonable, because it is unclear whether the list would provide helpful information to consumers. Accordingly, the final rule does not require a lender to provide an applicant for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare, as described under 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), with the list of homeownership counseling organizations required under § 1024.20.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1024.20 List of Homeownership Counseling Organizations</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to create a new requirement that lenders provide a list of homeownership counselors to applicants for federally related mortgage loans. Specifically, section 1450 the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 5(c) to require lenders to provide applicants with a “reasonably complete or updated list of homeownership counselors who are certified pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) and located in the area of the lender.”<footnote ref="24">
        Section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, 12 U.S.C. 1701x(e), requires that homeownership counseling provided under programs administered by HUD can only be provided by organizations or individuals certified by HUD as competent to provide homeownership counseling. Section 106(e) also requires HUD to establish standards and procedures for testing and certifying counselors.
        </footnote>
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The list of homeownership counselors is to be included with a “home buying information booklet” that the Bureau is directed to prepare “to help consumers applying for federally related mortgage loans to understand the nature and costs of real estate settlement services.”<footnote ref="25">
        The Dodd-Frank Act also amends RESPA section 5(b), 12 U.S.C. 2604(b), to require that the “home buying information booklet” (the RESPA “special information booklet,” prior to the Dodd-Frank Act), include “[i]nformation about homeownership counseling services made available pursuant to section 106(a)(4) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(a)(4)), a recommendation that the consumer use such services, and notification that a list of certified providers of homeownership counseling in the area, and their contact information, is available.”
        </footnote>
        Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, HUD was charged with distributing the RESPA “special information booklet” to lenders to help purchase-money mortgage borrowers understand the nature and costs of real estate settlement services. The Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 5(a) to direct the Bureau to distribute the “home buying information booklet” to all lenders that make federally related mortgage loans. The Dodd-Frank Act also amended section 5(a) to require the Bureau to distribute lists of homeownership counselors to such lenders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have implemented the Dodd-Frank Act's requirement that a lender provide lists of homeownership counselors to applicants for federally related mortgage loans. Proposed § 1024.20 generally would have required a lender to provide an applicant for a federally related mortgage loan with a list of five homeownership counselors or counseling organizations in the location of the applicant, not later than three days after receiving an application. Proposed § 1024.20 also would have set forth additional requirements related to the content and delivery of the list.

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is removing current § 1024.18. Current § 1024.18 states that “Section 17 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2615) governs the validity of contracts and liens under RESPA.” 12 U.S.C. 2615 states “Nothing in this Act shall affect the validity or enforceability of any sale or contract for the sale of real property or any loan, loan agreement, mortgage, or lien made or arising in connection with a federally related mortgage loan.” The Bureau believes that RESPA clearly delineates the validity and enforceability of contracts and liens and that § 1024.18 is an unnecessary restatement of the provisions of RESPA. Accordingly, in order to streamline the regulations, the Bureau is removing current § 1024.18.<footnote ref="66">

                Although the Bureau did not propose to remove § 1024.18, the Bureau finds there is good cause to finalize this aspect of the rule without notice and comment.

            <title>Section 1024.19 Enforcement</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau is removing § 1024.19. The first sentence of § 1024.19(a) states “[i]t is the policy of the Bureau regarding RESPA enforcement matters to cooperate with Federal, state, or local agencies having supervisory powers over lenders or other persons with responsibilities under RESPA.” The Bureau believes this statement, which reflects the Bureau's general policy to cooperate with counterpart agencies, is unnecessary. The second sentence of § 1024.19(a) states “Federal agencies with supervisory powers over lenders may use their powers to require compliance with RESPA.” Again, the Bureau believes this general statement of the supervisory authority of other federal agencies, which neither conveys authority nor creates limits or restrictions with respect to such authority, is unnecessary in Regulation X. Further, the third sentence of § 1024.19(a) states “[i]n addition, failure to comply with RESPA may be grounds for administrative action by HUD under HUD regulation 2 CFR part 2424 concerning debarment, suspension, ineligibility of contractors and grantees, or under HUD regulation 24 CFR part 25 concerning the HUD Mortgagee Review Board.” Here the Bureau believes that the applicable regulations issued by HUD are controlling and whether RESPA may serve as grounds for any such enumerated action is based on those HUD regulations. Accordingly, the Bureau believes this provision, which repeats the scope of HUD regulations, is unnecessary. Section 1024.19(a) states that “[n]othing in this paragraph is a limitation on any other form of enforcement that may be legally available.” Because the Bureau believes the other provisions of § 1024.19(a) are unnecessary, this remaining sentence is no longer necessary. Finally, § 1024.19(b) states that the Bureau's procedures for investigations and investigational proceedings are set forth in 12 CFR part 1080. A cross-reference to the location of the Bureau's regulations regarding investigations and investigational proceedings in Regulation X is unnecessary. Accordingly, § 1024.19 is removed in its entirety.<footnote ref="67">

                As with § 1024.18, the Bureau finds there is good cause to remove § 1024.19 without notice and comment. As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, § 1024.19 has no impact on, or significance for, any person; notice and comment therefore would be unnecessary.

                Section 1463 uses the term “federally related mortgage” but it amends and expands section 6 of RESPA that uses the term “federally related mortgage loan.” Accordingly, the Bureau interprets the “federally related mortgage” and “federally related mortgage loan” to be the same.
              </footnote>

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received three comment letters from consumer advocacy groups with respect to a small servicer exemption from certain requirements in Regulation X. One comment from three consumer advocacy groups indicated that small servicers should be exempt from the loss mitigation procedures requirements in § 1024.41 on the basis that these servicers already have an interest in mitigating any losses that might result from proceeding with foreclosure. Two other consumer advocacy groups, however, stated their view that if a servicer cannot afford to implement the required protections, the servicer should not be permitted to service mortgage loans. Further, a large bank joined in opposing an exemption for small servicers on the basis that such an exemption does not implement consumer protections for customers of small servicers and creates artificial distinctions that provide a competitive advantage to small servicers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received a significant number of comments from small banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers, as well as their trade associations, that requested that the Bureau consider an exemption for small servicers from the mortgage servicing rules, including the discretionary rulemakings. The Bureau also received a comment letter from Advocacy urging the implementation of a small servicer exemption for requirements in Regulation X.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Many of the small banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers that provided comments stated that their business models necessarily facilitate communication with delinquent borrowers. Per the comments, such servicers have an incentive to work with borrowers to avoid losses because typically, for small servicers, either the mortgage loan is owned by the servicer (or an affiliate) or the servicer has a customer relationship with the borrower to consider. Community banks, credit unions, and Advocacy further stated that the servicing market should not be considered simplistically; small servicers have substantially different business practices than larger servicers, including with respect to considering borrowers for loss mitigation or managing force-placed insurance. Further, such servicers have not been shown to have engaged in the servicing failures that contributed to the financial crisis, including poor oversight of third-party providers, lost documents and other process failures relating to loss mitigation evaluations, or wrongful filing of foreclosure documents that contain false information or fail to comply with applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comments from small banks, credit unions, non-bank servicers, and their trade associations, suggested various means for defining a small servicer. Most industry commenters indicated that the proposed 1,000 mortgage loan threshold was inadequate because it would capture only the smallest servicers in the market. One trade association commenter stated that a 1,000-mortgage-loan threshold would cover only single-employee servicing operations. Most commenters indicated that the small servicer exemption threshold should be raised to between 5,000 and 15,000 mortgage loans. One commenter indicated that a small servicer threshold should be based on a delinquency percentage or foreclosure filing threshold, while a large community bank servicer stated that a small servicer exemption should include all but the top five servicers by market share.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Small servicers indicated several components of the rulemaking that would have particularly problematic impacts on small servicers. For example, many small servicers and their trade associations raised concerns regarding the appeal process set forth in § 1024.41(h). Small servicers stated that required independent reviews for the appeal process would be difficult to implement because the size of a small servicer necessarily constrains the number of knowledgeable servicing personnel that would be able to conduct the independent review. Per the commenters, the resulting review would be without value because the independent review would be conducted by employees less familiar with, or skilled in, evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options. Small servicers also indicated they would be burdened by implementing new notice requirements, including those set forth in § 1024.39 and § 1024.41, which, commenters believed, would only serve to require communications that are already occurring, but would impose the cost of requirements to track communications and demonstrate compliance to appropriate regulators.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition to the comments, the Bureau reviewed the input gained through outreach with small servicers during the Small Business Review Panel process. As discussed throughout, in order to gain feedback on small servicer impacts, the Bureau participated in a Small Business Review Panel and conducted outreach with small entities that would be subject to the regulations. The Bureau solicited feedback from the small entities participating in the Small Business Review Panel on many elements of the loss mitigation process in conjunction with other elements of the servicing proposals, including impacts on loss mitigation processes of small servicers from proposed rules relating to error resolution, reasonable information management policies and procedures, early intervention for troubled or delinquent borrowers, and continuity of contact. In particular, the Bureau requested feedback from small servicers on the following: (1) A duty to suspend a foreclosure sale while a borrower is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option or other alternative to foreclosure; (2) the ability to adopt policies and procedures to facilitate review of borrowers for loss mitigation options; (3) the ability to provide information regarding loss mitigation early in the foreclosure process to borrowers; and (4) the ability to provide borrowers with the opportunity to discuss evaluations for loss mitigation options with designated servicer contact personnel.<footnote ref="69">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin.

            <analysisParagraph>The small entities generally informed the Small Business Review Panel that they engaged in individualized contact with borrowers early in the foreclosure process, that some servicers completed discussions of loss mitigation options with borrowers prior to a point in time when borrowers should receive significant foreclosure-related information, and that small servicers generally worked closely with foreclosure counsel such that foreclosure processes and loss mitigation could be easily conducted simultaneously without prejudice to the loss mitigation process. Further, the small entities explained that they were willing to communicate with borrowers about loss mitigation contemporaneously with the foreclosure process, and one small entity indicated that it would be willing to halt the foreclosure process, if appropriate, in order to consider a modification.<footnote ref="70">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin.

          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau carefully considered the comments regarding requested exemptions for small servicers, including the comments received from Advocacy. In addition, the Bureau carefully considered the specific aspects of the rule that community banks, small credit unions, and other small servicers indicated would potentially impact those institutions most significantly. The analysis conducted by the Bureau is set forth below, as well as in the analyses required pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In general, the Bureau is persuaded based on its experience, outreach, and the submission of the comments that the problematic practices that have plagued the servicing industry, particularly in recent years, are to a large extent a function of a business model in which servicing is viewed as a discrete line of business and profit center, and in which servicers compete to secure business from owners or assignees of mortgage loans based upon price. As discussed in greater detail in part II, such a model leads to a high volume, low margin business, in which servicers are not incentivized to invest in operations necessary to handle large numbers of delinquent borrowers. The significant weight of evidence of servicer failures of which the Bureau is aware involved large servicers following such a business model.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In contrast, there is a segment of servicers who service a relatively small number of mortgage loans and do not purchase or hold mortgage servicing rights for mortgage loans they do not own or did not originate. Many community bank and small credit union servicers fit this model. For example, the Bureau estimates that 10,829 banks, thrifts, and credit unions service 5,000 or fewer loans. Of these, approximately 96 percent have assets of $1 billion or less, which is the traditional threshold for denoting a community bank. The Bureau is not aware of evidence indicating the performance of these types of institutions in servicing the mortgage loans they originate or own generally results in substantial consumer harm. To the contrary, data available to the Bureau indicates that such servicers achieve significantly reduced levels of borrowers rolling into 90 or more days of delinquency or having a mortgage loan charged-off when compared to the average for all banks. For example, in 2011, the 90+ delinquency rate for community banks was 0.27 percent compared with over 6 percent for all banks. Further, the net charge-off rate for community banks was 0.66 percent against 1.31 percent for all banks. Community bank performance with respect to levels of delinquencies and charge-offs has also remained relatively stable through the financial crisis. From 2007 through 2011, the 90+ delinquency rate fluctuated between 0.27 percent in 2007 to a high of only 0.31 percent in 2009. The equivalent metric for all banks showed the 90+ delinquency rate at 0.80 percent rising rapidly to a high of 6.29 percent in 2011.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The reasons for this performance may lay in the fact that small servicers have very different incentives than large servicers. Servicers that service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and only service mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate owns or originated generally must be conscientious of the impact of servicing operations on the borrower. Any such servicer has an interest in maintaining a relationship with borrower as a customer of the bank or thrift or member of the credit union to provide other banking services. Further, such servicers must be conscientious of reputational consequences within a community or member base. Further, to the extent a servicer or an affiliate owns a mortgage loan, the servicer bears risk from the borrower's potential delinquency and default on the mortgage loan obligation and does not have an incentive to engage in practices that may put the performance of the mortgage loan obligation at risk.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>All of these considerations, as well as the performance data discussed above, persuades the Bureau that the small servicers are generally achieving the goals of the discretionary rulemakings to protect delinquent borrowers. The Bureau recognizes, however, that these small servicers may be achieving these ends through procedures that differ from those mandated in § 1024.39 and § 1024.41, with respect to early intervention and loss mitigation procedures, and that while the practice of these small servicers are, in the main, achieving the objectives delineated in § 104.38 and § 1024.40, with respect to general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements and continuity of contact, these servicers may not have systems in place to document how they are achieving these results. Thus, the Bureau believes that subjecting the small servicers to these provisions would impose costs that they could find difficult to absorb.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In sum, the Bureau is not persuaded at this time that the consumer protection purposes of RESPA necessarily would be furthered by requiring small servicers to comply with the discretionary rulemakings.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, a small servicer as defined pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4), that is, a servicer that services 5,000 mortgage loans or less and only services mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate owns or originated, is exempt from the requirements of § 1024.38 through 41, with two exceptions.<footnote ref="71">The 5,000-loan threshold reflects the purposes of the exemptions that the rule establishes for these servicers and the structure of the mortgage servicing industry. The Bureau's choice of 5,000 in loans serviced for purposes of Regulation X does not imply that a threshold of that type or of that magnitude would be an appropriate way to distinguish small firms for other purposes or in other industries.</footnote>
            First, § 1024.41(f) prohibits servicers from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless a borrower's mortgage loan obligation is greater than 120 days delinquent. Second, § 1024.41(g) prohibits a servicer from, among other things, proceeding with a foreclosure sale if the borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. The Bureau deems it highly unlikely, given the considerations discussed above, that a small servicer would initiate a foreclosure with respect to a borrower who is less than 120 days delinquent to conclude a foreclosure sale if a borrower was performing under a loss mitigation agreement. Nonetheless, the Bureau does not see any reason why these basic protections should not be extended to all borrowers or why subjecting small servicers to these prohibitions would create any burden for them. Accordingly, § 1024.41(j) extends these two rules to small servicers. The analysis pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act, set forth in part VII below, and the final regulatory flexibility analysis, set forth in part VIII below, provide significant additional discussion regarding the assumptions used in determining an appropriate small servicer exemption threshold of 5,000 mortgage loans.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from a nonprofit lender/servicer indicating that the mortgage servicing rules would be costly and difficult to implement, in light of the commenter's nonprofit mission and volunteer workforce. The commenter indicated that the Bureau should carry over the small servicer exemption proposed with respect to the periodic statement requirement in Regulation Z to the Regulation X requirements and should also implement a narrow exemption for nonprofit servicers. Although the Bureau declines to exempt nonprofit servicers separately, the Bureau believes that such servicers will likely fall within the small servicer exemption established by the Bureau.<footnote ref="72">The nonprofit lenders/servicer did not object to the proposed 1,000-loan threshold; the Bureau infers that this nonprofit lender/servicer would qualify as a small servicer under that threshold, much less the 5,000-loan threshold that the Bureau has implemented pursuant to § 1024.30.</footnote>
            To the extent a nonprofit servicer services more than 5,000 mortgage loans or services mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate does not own or did not originate, then the Bureau believes any such servicer should be required to provide appropriate consumer protection by implementing the loss mitigation procedures, notwithstanding the non-profit status of the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Other exemptions.</em> In addition to requests for a small servicer exemption, the Bureau received comments that it should implement exemptions for housing finance agencies, reverse mortgage transactions, and servicers that are qualified lenders as defined in regulations established by the Farm Credit Administration. Housing finance agencies and their associations commented that the mission orientation of these agencies weighs in favor of exempting such agencies from certain of the proposed mortgage servicing rules. A comment from one such agency with respect to the Homeowners' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program is instructive. That program assists a borrower experiencing hardship by extending a loan, secured by a subordinate lien on a borrower's property, to bring a borrower's first-lien mortgage loan current and, for certain borrowers, to provide continuing assistance. Absent an exemption, the servicing of the subordinate-lien mortgage loan that secures such assistance would be subject to mortgage servicing rules relating to loss mitigation, notwithstanding that the loan itself is a form of loss mitigation. In addition, the Bureau received comments from housing finance agencies indicating that the costs of certain of the rulemakings may be burdensome for housing finance agencies.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received comments from a trade association for reverse mortgage lenders and servicers. The commenter stated that many of the rulemakings, including the discretionary rulemakings, are not appropriate for reverse mortgage transactions. For example, loss mitigation requirements in the proposed rule were based on days of delinquency, which is an imprecise and difficult concept with respect to a reverse mortgage transaction because of the structure of the transaction. Further, the vast majority of reverse mortgage transactions are subject to regulations implemented by FHA in connection with the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from lenders subject to regulations established by the Farm Credit Administration with respect to loss mitigation. These entities requested exemptions for mortgage loans for which a servicer is required to comply with Farm Credit Administration requirements on loss mitigation because those requirements differ markedly from those proposed by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that additional exemptions are appropriate for certain of the rulemakings. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has determined not to implement these additional exemptions to those regulations that principally implement requirements set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. These include the requirements in §§ 1024.35 (Error Resolution Procedures), 1024.36 (Information Requests), and 1024.37 (Force-Placed Insurance). With respect to error resolution procedures and information requests, those provisions build upon the existing Qualified Written Request procedures, which are currently applicable to the servicers discussed above. Providing an exemption to these requirements would have removed a currently existing consumer protection.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded that imposing the requirements in the discretionary rulemakings on housing finance agencies does not further the goals of those requirements and imposes undue costs on housing finance agencies. Such agencies are engaged in programs that assist mortgage loan borrowers facing hardship under the auspices of state or local governments. The Bureau believes the mission of these agencies, as articulated by the agencies and their associations, clearly demonstrates that the interests of such agencies are aligned with those of borrowers, so that imposing the discretionary rulemakings on such agencies would not further the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. Accordingly, the Bureau exempts housing finance agencies from the requirements of §§ 1024.38 through 1024.41 as well as the principal restrictions of § 1024.17(k)(5). To effectuate this exemption, the Bureau simply uses the term “small servicer,” because Regulation Z, as amended by the 2013 TILA Servicing Rule, defines a housing finance agency as a small servicer without regard to the number of mortgage loans serviced by a housing finance agency.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is persuaded that the discretionary rulemakings are not appropriate for reverse mortgage transactions. For example, many of the timing requirements in § 1024.41 relate to the length of a borrower's delinquency, which is a concept that does not apply cleanly with respect to reverse mortgage transactions. Further, the vast majority of reverse mortgage transactions are subject to regulation by FHA pursuant to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. These regulations provide many protections for borrowers that are appropriate for the specific circumstances of a reverse mortgage transaction. The Bureau continues to consider appropriate requirements for reverse mortgage transactions separately from the mortgage servicing rulemakings.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau finds that “qualified lenders” subject to Farm Credit Administration regulation of their loss mitigation practices should be exempt from compliance with §§ 1024.38-41. The Bureau agrees with the commenters that the Farm Credit Administrations' regulations in this area offer consumer protections comparable to those in the mortgage servicing rules and subjecting such institutions to the new rules would subject such servicers to overlapping, and potentially inconsistent, regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined to exempt a servicer with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000 from the requirements of §§ 1024.38 through 41.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau has determined to revise the scope of certain sections. Section 1024.30(c) implements two limitations on the scope of subpart C. First, § 1024.33(a) is only applicable to mortgage loans that are secured by first liens. This limitation excludes from coverage subordinate-lien mortgage loans. Section 1024.33(a) is based on the existing § 1024.21, renumbered in accordance with the reorganization of Regulation X, and § 1024.21 is already limited to first-lien mortgage loans. When the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking is finalized, the Bureau anticipates that rule will alter the requirements for servicers to comply with § 1024.33(a). Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is beneficial to require servicers to begin implementing the requirements of § 1024.33(a) for subordinate-lien mortgage loans, only to have to adjust compliance with § 1024.33(a) upon finalization of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking. Accordingly, the Bureau is not making a change to the scope of § 1024.33(a) and retains the limitation on the scope of that requirement to mortgage loans that are secured by a first lien.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to maintain the exclusion for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) covered by TILA and Regulation Z, including open-end lines of credit secured by a first lien, from the mortgage servicing requirements in subpart C of Regulation X. Open-end lines of credit, which may be federally related mortgage loans when secured by a first or subordinate lien on residential real property, have been historically excluded from regulations applicable to mortgage servicing under Regulation X. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> current § 1024.21(a) (defining “mortgage servicing loan”). Further, open-end lines of credit are already regulated under Regulation Z. Certain provisions of Regulation Z would substantially overlap with the servicer obligations that would be set forth in subpart C, including, for example, billing error resolution procedures. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1026.13. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether to maintain an exemption for open-end lines of credit for the requirements in subpart C.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>To the extent industry commenters responded to the Bureau's request, they supported the continued exclusion of open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans). Two consumer advocacy groups, however, jointly commented that open-end credit transactions secured by a borrower's principal residence should be fully covered by RESPA. The two commenters stated that consumer protections for open-end lines of credit (home equity plans) are less robust than consumer protections for closed-end credit, particularly in the area of disclosures, error resolution, information requests, and penalties for violation. They expressed concerns that the Bureau has failed to appreciate these differences and the potential for consumer harm when predatory lenders exploit these differences. Additionally, the commenters questioned the Bureau's authority to exempt open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) when the statutory definition of the term “federally related mortgage loan” does not include such an exemption.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate at this time not to apply the requirements in subpart C to open-end credit (home equity lines). Open-end lines of credit secured by a first or subordinate lien on residential real property can constitute a federally related mortgage loans. As stated in the proposal, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) tend to reflect better credit quality than subordinate-lien closed-end mortgage loans and share risk characteristics more similar to other open-end consumer financial products, such as credit cards, because of the access to additional unutilized credit provided by a HELOC.<footnote ref="73">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Donghoon Lee &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et al., A New Look at Second Liens,&lt;/em&gt; 3, 19 (Feb. 2012), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;

            The Bureau understands from discussions with servicers and industry representatives that the servicing of HELOCs tends to differ significantly from closed-end mortgage loans, including with respect to information systems used, lender remedies (including restricting access to the line of credit), and borrower behavior. Further, the Bureau understands that although a household may finance a property solely with an open-end line of credit, the proportion that do so is very small.<footnote ref="74">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Julapa Jagtiani and William W. Lang, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Strategic Default on First and Second Lien Mortgages During The Financial Crisis,&lt;/em&gt; at n.5 (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Working Paper No. 11-3, Dec. 9, 2010), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;

          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the protections proposed in subpart C of Regulation X are not necessary for open-end lines of credit. As set forth above, separate error resolution and information request requirements exist under Regulation Z for open-end lines of credit. Further, the Bureau understands from servicers of open-end lines of credit that such servicers typically do not maintain escrow accounts for open-end lines of credit, require borrowers to maintain insurance for properties secured by open-end lines of credit, or force-place insurance for such borrowers. The Bureau believes that it would contravene the consumer protection purposes of RESPA for servicers to expend resources complying with overlapping or unnecessary requirements that would not benefit consumers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Further, open-end lines of credit perform differently from closed-end mortgages with respect to loss mitigation. A borrower is in control of an open-end line of credit and can draw from that line as necessary to meet financial obligations. Many borrowers who have become delinquent on a first lien closed-end mortgage loan keep current on payments for subordinate lien open-end lines of credit in order to maintain their access to the line of credit.<footnote ref="75">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Julapa Jagtiani and William W. Lang, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Strategic Default on First and Second Lien Mortgages During The Financial Crisis,&lt;/em&gt; at n.11 (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Working Paper No. 11-3, Dec. 9, 2010).</footnote>
            Conversely, when borrowers experience difficulty meeting their obligations, lenders have the ability to cut off access to unutilized draws from the open-end line of credit. These features of open-end lines of credit weigh against imposing the requirements set forth for early intervention with delinquent borrowers, continuity of contact, and loss mitigation procedures on servicers for open-end lines of credit. Further, open-end lines of credit tend to differ from closed-end mortgage loans with respect to servicing information systems utilized.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to maintain the current exemption, which HUD originally adopted as 24 CFR 3500.21 nearly 20 years ago. Accordingly, this exemption is authorized under section 19(a) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, § 1024.30(c)(2) limits the scope of §§ 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence. The purpose of the early intervention requirement, the continuity of contact requirement, and the loss mitigation procedures is to help borrowers stay in their principal residences, where possible, while mitigating the losses of loan owners and assignees, by ensuring that servicers use clear standards of review for loss mitigation options. The Bureau does not believe that this purpose is furthered by extending those protections to mortgage loans for investment, vacation, or other properties that are not principal residences. For example, in such circumstances, the protections set forth in §§ 1024.39-41 may only serve to assist a non-occupying borrower to maintain cash flow from rental revenue during a period of delinquency. Further, for certain properties that are not principal residences, there is a significant risk that a property may not be maintained and may present hazards and blight to local communities. Thus, for investment or vacation properties, the lack of borrower occupancy, and the potential rental income obtained by the borrower, vitiates the justifications for ensuring that a foreclosure process is not undertaken unless the borrower has the opportunity for review for a loss mitigation option. Finally, this limitation is consistent with the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and the National Mortgage Settlement, and its incorporation here furthers the goal of creating uniform standards.<footnote ref="76">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Cal.

            Accordingly, the Bureau has limited the scope of §§ 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by properties that are borrowers' principal residences.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Consumer reporting agency”; “Day”; “Reverse mortgage transaction”; “Master servicer”; “Transferee servicer”; “Transferor servicer.”</em> The Bureau proposed to move the definitions of “Master servicer,” “Transferee servicer,” and “Transferor servicer” from current § 1024.21(a) to proposed § 1024.31 without change. The Bureau also proposed to add new defined terms for “Reverse mortgage transaction” and “Consumer reporting agency,” in proposed § 1024.31 by adopting the same definition for those terms as is already provided in current Regulation Z and section 503 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a, respectively. The Bureau proposed to add a new defined term “Day” in proposed § 1024.31. The Bureau proposed to define “Day” to mean a calendar day because the Bureau believed that Congress intended that the term “day” by itself includes legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays for purposes of RESPA. No comments were received on these proposed defined terms. The final rule adopts these terms as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Hazard insurance.”</em> As discussed in the section-by-section analyses concerning §§ 1024.17(k)(5) and 1204.37, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6 of RESPA to establish new servicer duties with respect to the purchase of force-placed insurance on a property securing a federally related mortgage. The statute generally defines “force-placed insurance” as hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> section 6(k)(2). Thus, the statutory definition of “force-placed insurance” indicates that Congress intended the term “force-placed insurance” to mean a type of “hazard insurance.” However, neither the statute nor current Regulation X defines “hazard insurance.” The Bureau believed that it was necessary to define “hazard insurance” in order to implement the statute.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add new defined term “Hazard insurance” in proposed § 1024.31 to mean insurance on the property securing a mortgage loan that protects the property against loss caused by fire, wind, flood, earthquake, theft, falling objects, freezing, and other similar hazards for which the owner or assignee of such loan requires insurance. The Bureau modeled the definition of “hazard insurance” on the definition of “property insurance” in typical mortgage loan contracts, in light of the fact that the statute generally prohibits servicers from obtaining force-placed insurance “unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain property insurance.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> section 6(k)(1)(A). The Bureau thus interpreted the statute to mean that “force-placed hazard insurance” refers to “property insurance” that the borrower has failed to maintain as required by the borrower's mortgage loan contract.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the definition in general and in particular on the proposed inclusion of insurance to protect against flood loss. Although including flood insurance is consistent with the way typical mortgage loan contracts define “property insurance,” the Bureau did not believe that the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations should apply to servicers when they are required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) to purchase hazard insurance to protect against flood loss. The FDPA provides an extensive set of restrictions on flood insurance provision, and the Bureau was concerned that overlapping regulatory restrictions would be unduly burdensome and produce little consumer benefit. The Bureau thus proposed to include flood insurance as part of the general definition of “Hazard insurance,” but to exclude flood insurance that is required under the FDPA from the definition of “force-placed insurance” in proposed § 1024.37(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments from consumer groups or industry commenters on the proposed defined term “Hazard insurance” other than with respect to the treatment of flood insurance. On that topic, most industry commenters believed that simply excluding flood insurance obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of the term “force-placed insurance” in proposed § 1024.37(a)(2)(i) was workable and adequately mitigated the risk of a servicer having to comply with both regulations under the FDPA and the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations. But one large bank servicer and one large force-placed insurance provider urged the Bureau to exclude flood insurance from the defined term “Hazard insurance” in § 1024.31 instead.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The large bank servicer expressed concern that the proposed definitions of “hazard insurance” and “force-placed insurance” would effectively require a servicer to strictly monitor any potential change in a mortgage's property's flood zone designation because whether the FDPA requires a servicer to obtain hazard insurance to protect against flood loss depends, among other things, on whether a property is located in an area designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The commenter thus worried that the force-placed insurance requirements of § 1024.37 would become applicable instantaneously after a change in SFHA designations if that change meant that flood insurance was no longer required under the FDPA for a particular property. The Bureau, however, does not interpret § 1024.37 to apply in this way. Compliance with § 1024.37 would be required if the servicer decides to renew or replace a flood insurance policy that had been previously been required under the FDPA with a new policy after the property's SFHA designation had changed. As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to exclude hazard insurance required by the FDPA from the definition of “force-placed insurance” because the Bureau believes that the FDPA and other related Federal laws adequately regulated this activity. However, if a servicer chooses to renew or replace hazard insurance to protect against flood loss even though the insurance the renewal or replacement is no longer required by the FDPA, then the FDPA would not apply. The Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations are intended to fill precisely this gap to ensure that consumers have basic procedural and substantive protections in the absence of FDPA coverage. Thus, a servicer would have to check a property's flood zone designation when a servicer is about to renew or replace hazard insurance to protect against flood loss that the servicer originally obtained pursuant to the FDPA to determine whether the status has changed such that § 1024.37 would apply going forward. The Bureau believes that this presents minimal if any burden on servicers and is justified to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The large force-placed insurance provider urged the same result based on statutory interpretation grounds, asserting that Congress had not intended to include flood insurance as a type of hazard insurance that would potentially be subject to the force-placed insurance requirements because section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which governs the establishment of escrow accounts for certain higher-priced mortgage loans, contains separate definitions for “hazard insurance” and “flood insurance.” The commenter acknowledged that section 1461 is distinct from section 1463 and amends different underlying statutes, TILA and RESPA respectively. Nonetheless, it asserted that both address insurance for which premiums could be paid through the establishment of escrow accounts and therefore should be interpreted in tandem.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Again, the Bureau declines to make this change. The Bureau does not believe that Congress intended the statutory definition of “flood insurance” and “hazard insurance” in section 1461 to control the interpretation of “hazard insurance” for purposes of section 1463(a). Indeed, section 1461 expressly limits its scope by stating that “For purposes of this section, the following definitions [of “flood insurance” and “hazard insurance”] shall apply.” In light of this language, the Bureau does not believe that section 1461 controls. Section 1463(a) itself demonstrates that Congress expected the force-placed insurance provisions to apply to flood insurance other than that required by the FDPA. Section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(4) of RESPA states that nothing in the force-placed insurance provisions shall be construed as prohibiting a servicer from providing simultaneous or concurrent notice of a lack of flood insurance pursuant to the FDPA. This provision would have little impact if flood insurance could <em data-original="E-03">never</em> be considered force-placed insurance within the meaning of section 1463. Thus, the Bureau believes its interpretation of the statutory terms to apply the force-place insurance requirements to flood insurance that is not required by the FDPA and thus not subject to that statute's extensive regulation is consistent with the statutory language, congressional intent, and consumers' interests. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts the proposed defined term “Hazard insurance” as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Loss mitigation application.”</em> Proposed § 1024.31 would have defined a loss mitigation application as a submission from a borrower requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option in accordance with procedures established by the servicer for the submission of such requests. As discussed below with respect to § 1024.41, the Bureau received comments from large bank servicers regarding the application of the loss mitigation requirements on pre-qualification and informal oral communications with borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Based on the consideration of those comments, the Bureau has determined to revise the definition of a loss mitigation application. The Bureau believes that a loss mitigation application differentiates a communication or inquiry from a borrower regarding loss mitigation options from a borrower's request for consideration for a loss mitigation option. When a borrower, orally or writing, expresses an interest in a loss mitigation option and provides any information that would be evaluated by a servicer, that communication should be considered a loss mitigation application. A servicer must then determine whether the loss mitigation application is complete or incomplete pursuant to the requirements of § 1024.41(b). This definition of a loss mitigation application is similar to framework established in Regulation B with respect to an application for credit.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, § 1024.31 states that a loss mitigation application means an oral or written request for a loss mitigation option that is accompanied by any information required by a servicer for evaluation for a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Loss mitigation option.”</em> Pursuant to the Bureau's authorities under RESPA sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a), the Bureau proposed rules on error resolution (proposed § 1024.35), information management (proposed § 1024.38), early intervention (proposed § 1024.39), continuity of contact (proposed § 1024.40), and loss mitigation (proposed § 1024.41) that would have set forth servicer duties with respect to “Loss mitigation options.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to define “Loss mitigation options” at new § 1024.31 as “alternatives available from the servicer to the borrower to avoid foreclosure.” The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-1 that loss mitigation options include temporary and long-term relief, and options that allow borrowers to remain in or leave their homes, such as, without limitation, refinancing, trial or permanent modification, repayment of the amount owed over an extended period of time, forbearance of future payments, short-sale, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loss mitigation programs sponsored by a State or the Federal Government. The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 that loss mitigation options available from the servicer include options offered by the owner or assignee of the loan that are made available through the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters addressed the Bureau's proposed definition of “Loss mitigation options.” One industry commenter recommended that the term “Loss mitigation options” should be defined as alternatives available “from the investor through the servicer to the borrower” to avoid foreclosure, in light of the general industry practice that loss mitigation options are generally authorized by investors rather than servicers. While one industry trade group supported the proposed definition, other commenters were concerned that the breadth of the definition could conflict with servicers' delinquency management programs because the definition would subject short-term cures to the same procedural requirements as more permanent options. Similarly, industry commenters were concerned that the proposed definition would be inconsistent with requirements under existing loss mitigation programs, such as Farm Credit Administration rules and portions of the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of comments and upon further consideration, the Bureau is adopting a definition of the term “Loss mitigation option” substantially as proposed, but that incorporates the substance of proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 into the regulatory text. Accordingly, the final rule defines the term “Loss mitigation option” as an alternative to foreclosure offered by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that is made available through the servicer to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to define “Loss mitigation options” as alternatives available “from the servicer” to reflect the practical, day-to-day relationship between borrowers and servicers, in which servicers pursue loss mitigation activities with respect to delinquent borrowers on behalf of the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans. The Bureau had proposed to add comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 to clarify that the proposed definition should be read to include options offered by the owner and assignee and made available through the servicer in light of the actual legal relationship between servicers and owners or assignees, in which the owner or assignee authorizes the offering of loss mitigation options. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that the text of the definition should reflect the underlying legal relationship between servicers and owners or assignees to avoid confusion over whether servicers may be able to authorize loss mitigation options independent of the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 as proposed, but instead is amending the proposed definition to incorporate the substance of proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-2.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The definition of the term “Loss mitigation option” is broad to account for the wide variety of options that may be available to a borrower, the availability of which may vary depending on the underlying loan documents, any servicer obligations to the lender or assignee of the loan, the borrower's particular circumstances, and the flexibility the servicer has in arranging alternatives with the borrower. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-1 substantially as proposed to set forth examples of loss mitigation options “without limitation.” The Bureau has revised proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-1 to clarify that loss mitigation options include programs sponsored by “a locality” as well as a State or the Federal government and other non-substantive revisions describing options that allow borrowers “who are behind on their mortgage payments to remain in their homes or to leave their homes without a foreclosure.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau has developed a broad definition of loss mitigation options in order to accommodate the variety of loss mitigation programs, the Bureau does not intend for the provisions of Regulation X that use the term “Loss mitigation option” to require servicers to offer options that are inconsistent with any investor or guarantor requirements. Thus, under the Bureau's definition, an alternative that is not made available by the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan would not be a loss mitigation option for purposes of the final rule. The Bureau discusses the final rules that use the term “Loss mitigation option” in the applicable section-by-section analysis below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The final rule includes new language in comment 31 (Loss mitigation option) -2, which explains that a loss mitigation option available through the servicer refers to an option for which a borrower may apply, even if the borrower ultimately does not qualify for such option. The Bureau has included this comment to clarify that the regulatory text's reference to options “available” to borrowers is not intended to restrict the definition to options for which a borrower ultimately qualifies, but instead refers to options for which a borrower may apply.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>“ <em data-original="E-03">Mortgage loan.”</em> As discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30, the Bureau proposed to add a new defined term “Mortgage loan” in proposed § 1024.31 to mean any federally related mortgage loan, as that term is defined in § 1024.2, subject to the exemptions in § 1024.5(b), but does not include open-end lines of credit (home equity plans). For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30, the Bureau is adopting the proposed definition to the defined term “Mortgage loan” as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>“ <em data-original="E-03">Qualified written request.”</em> The Bureau proposed to adopt the defined term “Qualified written request” included in current § 1024.21(a) in proposed § 1024.31 without change, except to add related commentary, proposed 31 (qualified written request)-1, that would have explained that: (1) A qualified written request is a written notice a borrower provides to request a servicer either correct an error relating to the servicing of a loan or to request information relating to the servicing of the loan; and (2) a qualified written request is not required to include both types of requests. For example, a qualified written request may request information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan but not assert that an error relating to the servicing of a loan has occurred.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that the Bureau should clarify that the policies, procedures, and penalties related to a qualified written request are the same as those related to error resolution and information requests under §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36. The Bureau agrees that it would be helpful to clarify that the error resolution and information request requirements in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request, and accordingly, is adopting new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2 for that purpose. However, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to discuss a servicer's penalties for violation of the Bureau's regulations in either the regulation or the commentary.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has made slight modifications to the proposed definition of “qualified written request” so it more closely tracks the definition included in section 6(e)(1) of RESPA. The final rule defines “qualified written request” to mean a written correspondence from the borrower to the servicer that includes, or otherwise enables the servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower, and either: (1) States the reasons the borrower believes the account is in error; or (2) provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding information relating to the servicing of the mortgage loan sought by the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Service provider.”</em> The Bureau proposed to add new defined term “Service provider” in proposed § 1024.31 to mean any party retained by a servicer that interacts with a borrower or provides a service to the servicer for which a borrower may incur a fee. The Bureau proposed related commentary, comment 31 (service provider)-1, that would have clarified that service providers may include attorneys retained to represent a servicer or an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan in a foreclosure proceeding, as well as other professionals retained to provide appraisals or inspections of properties. Two industry groups representing appraisal professionals submitted joint comments that objected to the inclusion of appraisal professionals in the Bureau's proposed comment 31 (service provider)-1. The commenters sought clarification from the Bureau about the circumstances under which appraisers are “service providers” and what their obligations would be. The Bureau believes that comment 31 (service provider)-1 is clear in describing the circumstances under which appraisal professionals are “service providers” and thus feels no further explanation is required. While acknowledging that the Bureau's mortgage servicing rules do not directly regulate real estate appraisal services, the commenters claimed that individual appraisers and small appraisal firms would experience costly and unnecessary hardship if they were considered “service providers.” The Bureau disagrees. The definition of the term “service provider” in § 1024.31, by its terms, applies only for purposes of subpart C, and the term “service provider” appears only in § 1024.38 of subpart C. Section 1024.38 requires servicers maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that they can exercise reasonable oversight of their service providers. The Bureau does not believe that requiring servicers to exercise reasonable oversight of their service providers will lead to costly and unnecessary hardship on individual appraisers and small appraisal firms.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Subservicer.”</em> The Bureau proposed to adopt the defined term “Subservicer” included in current § 1024.21(a) in proposed § 1024.31 without change. The proposed defined term “Subservicer” provides that a “subservicer” is any servicer who does not own the right to perform servicing, but who performs servicing on behalf of the master servicer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that the Bureau should replace the reference to “master servicer” in the definition of “subservicer” with “servicer” to accommodate circumstances where there are multiple levels of subservicing. The example the commenter provided is one where there is one master servicer, but also a primary servicer and multiple subservicers. It appears that the commenter's concern is that people might be confused by thinking “primary servicers” would not be considered “subservicers” for purposes of subpart C of Regulation X. Based on the example provided by the commenter, the Bureau understands that a primary servicer is performing servicing on behalf of the master servicer, who owns the right to perform servicing. Because the primary servicer is not the owner of the right to perform servicing, it would be a “subservicer” pursuant to the proposed definition to the defined term “Subservicer.” Although industry practice may differentiate between levels of subservicing by referring to a servicer that directly performs servicing on behalf of a master servicer as the “primary servicer,” and servicers performing on behalf of the “primary servicer” as “subservicers,” for purposes of subpart C, any servicer that does not own the servicing right but performs servicing on behalf of a servicer that owns the servicing right is a subservicer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes the proposed definition to the defined term “Subservicer” adequately captures situations where there are multiple levels of subservicing and the defined term “Subservicer” is adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau set forth requirements applicable to disclosures required by subpart C in proposed § 1024.32. Specifically, proposed § 1024.32(a)(1) would have required that disclosures provided by servicers be clear and conspicuous, in writing, and in a form the consumer may keep. This standard is consistent with disclosure standards applicable in other regulations issued by the Bureau, including, for example, Regulation Z. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 12 CFR 1026.17(a)(1). Proposed § 1024.32(a)(2) would have permitted disclosures to be provided in languages other than English, so long as disclosures are made available in English upon a borrower's request. Further, proposed § 1024.32(b) would have permitted disclosures required under subpart C to be combined with disclosures required by applicable laws, including State laws, as well as disclosures required pursuant to the terms of an agreement between the servicer and a Federal or State regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the final rule as proposed, with minor changes to § 1024.32(a)(1) to replace the term “consumer,” with “recipient” as applicable and to improve the clarity of § 1024.32. Two commenters representing industry trade groups suggested that the clarity of § 1024.32(a) could be enhanced if the final rule could remove the term “consumer” where permissible because the term “consumer” is more appropriate in the context of disclosures provided prior to the consummation of the mortgage loan transaction.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a) Servicing Disclosure Statement</title>
              <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(a) generally sets forth requirements for persons making federally related mortgage loans to disclose to loan applicants, at the time of application, whether servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan is outstanding. 12 U.S.C. 2605(a). Current § 1024.21(b) and (c) implements requirements in RESPA section 6(a) related to the servicing disclosure statement. The Bureau's proposed § 1024.33(a) would have made certain changes to the requirements currently set forth in § 1024.21(b) and (c) pertaining to the servicing disclosure statement, including changes to the scope of applicability and delivery of the servicing disclosure statement, and certain other non-substantive technical revisions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions to conform § 1024.33(a) to the comprehensive amendments to consumer mortgage disclosures proposed by the Bureau in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.<footnote ref="78">The Bureau issued the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal on July 9, 2012.</footnote>
            Because the Bureau intended to incorporate the servicing disclosure statement requirements of RESPA section 6(a) into the consolidated disclosure forms for the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking, the Bureau had proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement provisions in new § 1024.33 to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions because those transactions would not be covered by the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After additional consideration, because the Bureau will not be finalizing the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal until after this final rule, the Bureau has decided not to finalize the language in proposed § 1024.33(a) that would have limited the scope of the provision to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. Instead, the Bureau is finalizing § 1024.33(a) by conforming the scope to “mortgage loans” other than subordinate-lien mortgage loans, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(c) above. The Bureau is excluding subordinate liens in order to maintain the current coverage of the servicing disclosure statement requirement in Regulation X.<footnote ref="79">The Bureau notes that it proposed in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal to implement the servicing disclosure requirement in RESPA section 6(a) through a disclosure appearing on the Bureau's proposed Loan Estimate for both first and subordinate liens &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal, 77 FR 51116, 51230 (2012) and proposed &amp;#167; 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</footnote>

            the Bureau relies on the same authority to maintain the current exemption. Accordingly, in the final rule, the Bureau has added language to § 1024.33(a) so that applicants for “first-lien mortgage loans” must receive the servicing disclosure statement, as indicated at § 1024.30(c)(1). Thus, applicants for both reverse and forward mortgage loans must receive the servicing disclosure statement. The Bureau expects to harmonize the scope of § 1024.33(a) in the final rule implementing the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures and to provide for consolidated disclosure forms at that time.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add comment 33(a)(1)-2 to § 1024.33(a) to clarify that the servicing disclosure statement need only be provided to the “primary applicant.” Current § 1024.21(b) requires that the servicing disclosure statement be provided to mortgage servicing loan applicants, and current § 1024.21(c) provides that if co-applicants indicate the same address on their application, one copy delivered to that address is sufficient, but that if different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants. The Bureau proposed to implement through commentary to § 1024.33(a) a clarification relating to providing a servicing disclosure statement for co-applicants—that when an application involves more than one applicant, notification need only be given to one applicant but must be given to the primary applicant when one is readily apparent. A credit union trade association supported this proposed change.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In its proposal, the Bureau explained that the modified requirement would reduce burdens on servicers without significantly reducing consumer protections, given that the Bureau proposed to apply the regulation only to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. The Bureau explained that such transactions are typically only conducted with regard to a borrower's principal residence and do not involve ongoing consumer payments for the life of the loan, so that contact with servicers is generally quite minimal. The Bureau also observed that amending the current requirement would be consistent with disclosure requirements applicable to other Bureau regulations, such as the adverse action notice required under Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act).<footnote ref="81">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1002.9(f).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau is not limiting § 1024.33(a) to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions in the final rule, as originally proposed, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 33(a)(1)-2 as proposed and is not amending the existing requirement in § 1024.21(c), under which the servicing disclosure statement must be provided to co-applicants if different addresses are shown by co-applicants. Instead, comment 33(a)-2 contains the same guidance that originally appeared in § 1024.21(c): That if co-applicants indicate the same address on their application, one copy of the servicing disclosure statement delivered to that address is sufficient; and that if different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, in addition to proposing changes about the scope of the rule, the Bureau proposed in § 1024.33(a) to make certain non-substantive changes to language from current § 1024.21(b) and (c) to clarify the circumstances under which the servicing disclosure statement must be provided and the proper use of appendix MS-1, which provides a model form for the servicing disclosure statement. For example, § 1024.21(b) currently provides that the servicing disclosure statement must be provided “[a]t the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within three days after submission of the application.” The Bureau's proposed § 1024.33(a) stated that the servicing disclosure statement must be provided “[w]ithin three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after a person applies [.]” The Bureau also proposed to incorporate some of the language currently in § 1024.21(b) and (c) into new Regulation X official commentary. For example, the Bureau proposed to move § 1024.21(b)(1), which explained use of appendix MS-2, to new comment 33(a)-1; the Bureau also included generally applicable instructions for use of model forms and clauses in commentary to appendix MS.

              <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau has replaced the phrase “table funding mortgage broker” with the phrase “mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding,” which the Bureau believes is clearer and better conforms to the term that currently appears in § 1024.21(b)(1). In addition, the Bureau has consolidated proposed comments 33(a)(2)-1, -2, and -3 into comment 33(a)-3, which contains disclosure preparation instructions currently in § 1024.21(b)(2).<footnote ref="82">The disclosure preparation instructions in current § 1024.21(b)(2) refer to “table funding mortgage broker.” In implementing these instructions through comment 33(a)-3, the Bureau has replaced that phrase with the phrase “mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding” to better conform to the language in § 1024.33(a).</footnote>
            Comment 33(a)-3 explains that, if the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan knows at the time of the disclosure whether it will service the mortgage loan for which the applicant has applied, the disclosure should, as applicable, state that such entity will service such loan and does not intend to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing of the loan, or that such entity intends to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of such mortgage loan before the first payment is due. The comment also provides that, in all other instances, a disclosure that states that the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred while the loan is outstanding complies with § 1024.33(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also makes a technical revision to the last sentence of proposed § 1024.33(a).

                    <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(b)(2)(A) requires that the transferor's notice be provided not less than 15 days before the effective date of transfer of servicing, except as provided in RESPA section 6(b)(2)(B) and (C), which provides that the notice may be provided under different timeframes in certain cases. 12 U.S.C. 2605(b)(2)(A). RESPA section 6(c)(2)(A) requires that the transferee's notice be provided not more than 15 days after the effective date of transfer, except as provided in RESPA section 6(c)(2)(B) and (C). 12 U.S.C. 2605(c)(2)(A). Current § 1024.21(d)(2)(i) implements these requirements and provides that, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(2)(ii), the notice of transfer must be provided by the transferor not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and by the transferee not more than 15 days after the effective date of the transfer. The Bureau proposed to move these requirements to new § 1024.33(b)(3)(i).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Several individual consumers suggested that a 15-day timeframe was too short a period for borrowers to make adjustments with respect to whom they should direct their mortgage payments. They recommended that transferees should be required to provide the transfer notice 30 to 45 days in advance of the effective date of transfer. In its final rule, the Bureau is not adjusting the exiting timing requirements. The 15-day time period was established by Congress, which reasonably concluded that this time period provides borrowers with sufficient time to make adjustments to any automated payment systems. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is minimal risk to borrowers who may be unable to send payments to the proper servicer after a transfer. Pursuant to § 1024.33(c)(1), servicers generally may not treat a payment as late for 60 days after a transfer if a borrower makes a timely but misdirected payment to the transferee servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Delivery.</em> Subparagraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of RESPA section 6 require that the transferor and transferee servicer notify “the borrower” of any assignment, sale, or transfer of servicing. Current § 1024.21(d)(1)(i) implements these requirements by requiring that notices be delivered to “the borrower.” However, unlike as set forth in current § 1024.21(c) with respect to the servicing disclosure statement, current § 1024.21(d) does not contain specific delivery instructions for delivering servicing transfer notice under § 1024.21(d) to multiple borrowers. The Bureau proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 to clarify that a notice of transfer should be delivered to the mailing address listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents, unless the borrower has notified the servicer of a new address pursuant to the servicer's requirements for receiving a notice of a change of address. Proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 further clarified that when a mortgage loan has more than one borrower, the notice of transfer need only be given to one borrower, but must be given to the primary borrower when one is readily apparent.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the language in proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 clarifying that a servicer deliver the notice of transfer to the mailing address listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents unless the borrower has notified the servicer of a new address pursuant to the servicer's requirements for receiving a notice of a change in address. However, the Bureau did receive comment on the proposed language clarifying that servicers may provide the transfer notice to the “primary” borrower. Industry commenters supported the proposed limitation to provide the transfer notice only to the primary borrower. One industry commenter indicated, however, that servicers generally will not know who the primary borrower is, noting that servicers would likely rely on the owner's or a prior servicer's designation in servicer transfer instructions, or the party that is listed first on the note. The industry commenter recommended that the Bureau permit such reliance.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Two consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau omit this comment. These commenters were concerned that providing notice to only one party would not ensure that multiple obligors, or even the party who is actually making payments on the mortgage, would receive it. For example, in the event of a divorce or separation, a “primary” borrower could be a spouse who is no longer living at home but who has submitted a change-of-address notice to the servicer. In another scenario, a borrower not living at home could be under a family court order to make mortgage payments even though the borrower is not a “primary” borrower. In these types of cases, the consumer groups were concerned that borrowers not considered “primary” would not receive the transfer notice. The consumer groups also raised concern about the lack of a definition of “primary” borrower and observed that, even if a definition were provided, a servicer's original designation of “primary” may become inaccurate over time if the obligors' relationship changes or other changed circumstances arise. The consumer groups also noted that sending two notices is not costly, would simplify compliance, and would reduce the risk that an interested borrower would not receive the notice.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In light of comments received, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 regarding delivery to “primary” borrowers. The Bureau recognizes that a party who may be “primary” at application could change over time without the servicer's knowledge, which could be problematic for borrowers responsible for making ongoing payments to their servicer. The Bureau believes that servicers should be responsible for providing a notice to the address listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents or different addresses they have received through their own procedures, consistent with § 1024.11<footnote ref="86">Section 1024.11 provides that “the provisions of [part 1024] requiring or permitting mailing of documents shall be deemed to be satisfied by placing the document in the mail (whether or not received by the addressee) addressed to the addresses stated in the loan application or in the other information submitted to or obtained by the lender at the time of loan application or submitted or obtained by the lender or settlement agent, except that a revised address shall be used where the lender or settlement agent has been expressly informed in writing of a change in address.”</footnote>

Ca. 2009) (&amp;#8220;Countrywide submits, and the Court agrees, that RESPA requires a lender to send a Good Bye letter to the Mailing Address listed by the borrower in the loan documents. When the borrower submits an express change of mailing address, the lender is required to send the Good Bye letter to the new address.&amp;#8221;).</footnote>

            The Bureau has otherwise retained proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 substantially as proposed. The Bureau has omitted the comment limiting delivery to “primary” borrowers, added parenthetical language about providing the notice to “addresses,” and has renumbered the comment as 33(b)(3)-1 because of the deletion of proposed comment 33(b)(3)-1 discussed above. Comment 33(b)(3)-1 explains that a servicer mailing the notice of transfer must deliver the notice to the mailing address (or addresses) listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents, unless the borrower has notified the servicer of a new address (or addresses) pursuant to the servicer's requirements for receiving a notice of a change in address.</analysisParagraph>

Paragraphs (b)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(B) permit these notices to be provided not more than 30 days after the effective date of assignment, sale, or transfer that is preceded by the termination of a servicing contract for cause, a servicer's bankruptcy, or the commencement of proceedings by the FDIC for conservatorship or receivership of the servicer. These exemptions to the general timing requirements are currently set forth in § 1024.21(d)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau had proposed to adopt the existing exemptions and add § 1024.33(b)(3)(ii)(D), which would extend the current 30-day exemption to situations in which the transfer of servicing is preceded by commencement of proceedings by the NCUA for appointment of a conservator or liquidating agent of the servicer or an entity that owns or controls the servicer. The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal and is adopting new § 1024.33(b)(3)(ii)(D) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As is evident by RESPA section 6(b)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(B), one of the purposes of RESPA is to provide exemptions from the general transfer notice timing requirements for servicing transfers occurring in the context of troubled institutions involving the appointment of an agent by a Federal agency, such as those in which a servicing transfer is preceded by the commencement of proceedings by the FDIC for conservatorship or receivership of the servicer (or an entity by which the servicer is owned or controlled). The Bureau does not believe that the timing for providing a servicing transfer disclosure should differ for an insured credit union in the process of conservatorship of liquidation by the NCUA compared to an insured depository institution in the process of conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC. Thus, because the Bureau believes institutions for which the NCUA has commenced proceedings to appoint a conservator or liquidating agent should be treated similarly to those for which the FDIC has commenced proceedings to appoint a conservator or receiver, the Bureau believes § 1024.33(b)(3)(ii)(D) is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. Accordingly, the Bureau exercises its authority under RESPA section 19(a) to grant reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>

Current § 1024.21(d)(2)(iii) implements these provisions and provides that notices of transfer delivered at settlement by the transferor servicer and transferee servicer, whether as separate notices or as a combined notice, satisfy the timing requirements of § 1024.21(d)(2). The Bureau proposed to move this provision to new comment 33(b)(3)-1 substantially as in the original.<footnote ref="88">Whereas § 1024.21(d)(2)(iii) describes a notice of transfer “delivered” at settlement, § 1024.33(b)(3)(iii) describes a notice of transfer “provided” at settlement.

                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the requirements in proposed § 1024.33(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) substantially as proposed. However, the Bureau is retaining the option to include a collect call number because, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes some servicers may continue to use collect call numbers. The Bureau is also retaining the requirement to provide contact information for either an employee or department in the final rule. Neither the statute nor the regulatory provision requires servicers to list specific employees but instead gives servicers the option of listing personnel or a department contact number. The Bureau believes servicers should be able to determine the most appropriate point of contact within their organizations. While the Bureau recognizes that servicer personnel may change over time, the Bureau does not believe that there is significant risk from the potential that contact information may be inaccurate because servicers are required under § 1024.38 to have policies and procedures in place to achieve the objective of providing accurate information to borrowers. Servicers may choose to provide department-level contacts to ease their own compliance. The Bureau believes borrowers would likely benefit from the disclosure of specific employees to the extent the servicer decides to list them.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the recommendation to require that the servicing transfer notice identify the owner or assignee of the loan in addition to contact information for the transferor and transferee servicer but is not adopting such a requirement in the final rule. First, the Bureau notes that the servicing disclosure statement provided at application pursuant to § 1024.33(a) already provides information about whether the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer may assign, sell, or transfer the mortgage servicing to any other person at any time. Additionally, the Bureau believes the language in the model form at appendix MS-2, explaining that a new servicer will be collecting the borrower's mortgage loan payments and that nothing else about the borrower's mortgage loan will change, will avoid potential confusion about what the transfer of servicing means for a borrower's loan. Additionally, as explained above, the Bureau believes that borrowers are best served by a transfer notice that sets forth the most relevant information related to the transfer of servicing of their loan and who should receive their payments requiring additional information in the notice about the owner or the loan may be confusing. Finally, the servicing transfer notice will include contact information for the transferor and transferee servicer that the borrower may contact with any questions.<footnote ref="90">Pursuant to § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A), a servicer generally must respond within 10 days to borrower requests for information about the identify or, and address or relevant contact information for, the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan.</footnote>

The Bureau believes servicers should be able to determine the most appropriate point of contact within their organizations. While the Bureau recognizes that servicer personnel may change over time, the Bureau does not believe that there is significant risk from the potential that contact information may be inaccurate because servicers are required under § 1024.38 to have policies and procedures in place to achieve the objective of providing accurate information to borrowers. Servicers may choose to provide department-level contacts to ease their own compliance. The Bureau believes borrowers would likely benefit from the disclosure of specific employees to the extent the servicer decides to list them.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the recommendation to require that the servicing transfer notice identify the owner or assignee of the loan in addition to contact information for the transferor and transferee servicer but is not adopting such a requirement in the final rule. First, the Bureau notes that the servicing disclosure statement provided at application pursuant to § 1024.33(a) already provides information about whether the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer may assign, sell, or transfer the mortgage servicing to any other person at any time. Additionally, the Bureau believes the language in the model form at appendix MS-2, explaining that a new servicer will be collecting the borrower's mortgage loan payments and that nothing else about the borrower's mortgage loan will change, will avoid potential confusion about what the transfer of servicing means for a borrower's loan. Additionally, as explained above, the Bureau believes that borrowers are best served by a transfer notice that sets forth the most relevant information related to the transfer of servicing of their loan and who should receive their payments requiring additional information in the notice about the owner or the loan may be confusing. Finally, the servicing transfer notice will include contact information for the transferor and transferee servicer that the borrower may contact with any questions.<footnote ref="90">Pursuant to § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A), a servicer generally must respond within 10 days to borrower requests for information about the identify or, and address or relevant contact information for, the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan.</footnote>

                  <title>Overview</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(b)(3) sets forth content requirements for the transferor notice, and RESPA section 6(c)(3) requires that the transferee notice contain the same content required by RESPA section 6(b)(3). 12 U.S.C. 2605(b)(3) and (c)(3). RESPA section 6(b)(3)(A) through (G) requires that the transferor and transferee notice contain the effective date of transfer, contact information for the transferee servicer, the name of an individual or department of the transferor and transferee servicer who may be contacted for borrower inquiries, the date on which the transferor will stop accepting payments and the date on which the transferee servicers will begin accepting payments, any information about the effect of the transfer on the availability of insurance, and a statement that the transfer will not affect any term or condition of the mortgage loan, other than servicing. These requirements are currently implemented by § 1024.21(d)(3)(i) through (vi). Section 1024.21(d)(3)(vii) also requires servicers to include a statement of the borrower's rights in connection with complaint resolution, including the information set forth in § 1024.21(e), as illustrated by current appendix MS-2.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to adopt most of the existing content requirements from current § 1024.21(d)(3), with the exception of the complaint resolution statement in § 1024.21(d)(3)(viii) and certain other changes discussed in more detail below. Except as otherwise discussed below, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.33(b)(4) as proposed. Accordingly, § 1024.34(b)(4) sets forth content requirements for the transfer notice, including the effective date of the servicing transfer; the name, address, and telephone number for the transferor and transferee servicers to answer inquiries related to the transfer of servicing; the date on which the transferor will stop accepting payments and the date the transferee will begin accepting payments, as well as the address for the transferee servicer to which borrower payments should be sent; information about whether the transfer will affect the terms or availability of insurance coverage; and a statement indicating that the transfer does not affect any of the mortgage loan terms other than servicing.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Information about loan status.</em> Two consumer advocacy groups also requested that the Bureau require that transfer notices provide information about the default status of the loan and include a full payment history. The groups explained that many servicing problems occur at or near the time of transferring servicing records and that errors involving one or two payments can spiral into a threatened foreclosure despite borrower efforts to prove that payments were in fact made. Thus, the consumer groups recommended that the transfer notices should advise if the homeowner is current and whether there are any unpaid fees, and the status of loss mitigation options being considered. They also recommended that a full payment history, including allocation of the payments to interest, principal, late fees, and other fees should be included by both the old and the new servicer, so that the homeowner may promptly ascertain if there is a discrepancy in the records. These commenters also requested that the Bureau require that fees not listed in a payment history provided at the transfer of servicing be waived.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the problems that can arise when servicing is transferred, especially in the case of a borrower who is not current at the time of transfer. However, requiring individualized information about each borrower's loan could significantly affect the time required to produce the notice as well as the cost. Moreover, the Bureau believes that other new provisions being finalized in Regulation X and Regulation Z will adequately address borrowers' interests in ensuring the accuracy of transferred records concerning their payment history. First, borrowers will be able to obtain information about their current payment status on a monthly basis on the periodic statement required under the Regulation Z provision that the Bureau is finalizing in the 2013 TILA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule. That statement will show, among other things, the payment amount due, the amount of any late payment fee, the total sum of any fees or charges imposed since the last statement, the total of all payments received since the last statement, the total of all payments received since the beginning of the current calendar year, transaction activity since the last statement, the outstanding principal balance, the borrower's delinquency status, amounts past due from previous billing cycles, and the total payment amount needed to bring the account current. As a result, if there are discrepancies between the last statement provided by the prior servicer and the first statement provided by the new servicer, those discrepancies will be apparent on the face of the statements. Second, borrowers will also be able to assert errors and request information about their payment history and current status through the new error resolution and information request provisions of Regulation X §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36; and new § 1024.38(b)(1)(iii) requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can provide a borrower with accurate and timely information and documents in response to the borrower's requests for information with respect to the servicing of the borrower's mortgage loan account. Third, new § 1024.38(b)(4) generally requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure (as a transferor servicer) the timely transfer of all information and documents in a manner that ensures the accuracy of information and documents transferred, and (as a transferee servicer) identify necessary documents or information that may not have been transferred by a transferor servicer and obtain such documents from the transferor servicer. Fourth, new § 1024.38(c)(2) generally requires, among other things, that servicers maintain a schedule of all transactions credited or debited to the mortgage loan account, including any escrow account defined in § 1024.17(b) and any suspense account and data in a manner that facilitates compiling such documents and data into a servicing file within five days. In light of these provisions, the Bureau does not believe that the cost of providing the default status of the loan or a full payment history with the servicing transfer notice for all borrowers would be justified.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Statement of borrower's rights in connection with the complaint resolution process.</em> Although not specifically required by RESPA section 6(b)(3), current § 1024.21(d)(3)(vii) requires that the transfer notice include a statement of the borrower's rights in connection with the complaint resolution process. The Bureau proposed to remove this requirement from the servicing transfer notice in new § 1024.33(b)(4). Two consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau retain the current requirement, noting that borrowers would benefit from being informed of their rights related to errors and information requests. They asserted that retaining an existing disclosure would not add new burden. Further, they asserted that omitting the disclosure would not significantly reduce burden because the language in the proposed revised model notice (without the complaint resolution statement) at appendix MS-2 would likely only comprise one page, and that adding a paragraph about the error resolution and information rights might at most extend some of the information to the back side of the notice, but would not require an additional page or increased postage.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>After considering the comments received, the Bureau has decided to adopt § 1024.33(b)(4) without a requirement to provide information about complaint resolution, as proposed. The Bureau believes that borrowers are best served by providing a notice that clearly and concisely explains that the servicing of their mortgage is being transferred, and that detailed information about the error resolution and information request process may not always be optimally located in the transfer notice. Additionally, as a result of amendments to the error resolution and information request procedures that the Bureau is finalizing in this rule, the existing disclosure in current appendix MS-2 would no longer be completely accurate.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that borrowers should be notified of their rights in connection with errors and inquiries, but the Bureau believes that borrowers should be informed of the error resolution and information request process through mechanisms that do not necessarily depend on the transfer of servicing. To address this, the Bureau is adding a requirement in § 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers inform borrowers of procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in § 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in § 1024.36. New comment 38(b)(5)-1 explains, among other things, that a servicer may comply with § 1024.38(b)(5) by including in the periodic statement required pursuant to § 1026.41 a brief statement informing borrowers that borrowers have certain rights under Federal law related to resolving errors and requesting information about their account, and that they may learn more about their rights by contacting the servicer, and a statement directing borrowers to a Web site that provides the information about the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36.<footnote ref="89">During the fourth round of consumer testing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Bureau tested a brief statement informing borrowers that they have rights associated with resolving errors. While participants generally understood the meaning of the clause, the Bureau is not finalizing model language for a statement informing borrowers of their rights to resolve errors and request information.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a requirement to establish policies and procedures to achieve the objective of notifying borrowers of the written error resolution and information request procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 36 will provide servicers with more flexibility to the time and in a manner in which to notify borrowers about the written error resolution and information request procedures. Specifically, the Bureau expects that servicers may decide to inform borrowers about these procedures at a time and in a manner that borrowers are more likely to find beneficial than at the time of servicing transfer. Further, as described in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.40, pursuant to § 1024.40(b)(4), servicers must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that continuity of contact personnel assigned to assist delinquent borrowers provide such borrowers with information about the procedures for submitting a notice of error pursuant to § 1024.35 or an information request pursuant to § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes borrowers are most likely to raise questions and complaints with servicers outside of the formal process outlined in §§ 1024.35 and 36. To ensure that servicers have systems in place for responding to errors and information requests through informal means, the Bureau believes servicers should have reasonable policies and procedures in place for responding to errors and information requests that fall outside of the required error resolution and information request procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 36. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.38(b)(1), the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can investigate, respond to, and, as appropriate, make corrections in response to borrower complaints, and provide accurate and timely information and documents in response to borrower information requests. Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting the proposal to remove the requirement that the servicing transfer notice describe the complaint resolution statement currently set forth in § 1024.21(d)(3)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(b) Notice of Transfer of Loan Servicing</title>
              <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(b) and (c) sets forth the general requirement for the transferor and transferee servicers of a federally related mortgage loan to notify the borrower in writing of any assignment, sale, or transfer of servicing. 12 U.S.C. 2605(b) and (c). These statutory requirements are implemented through current § 1024.21(d). The Bureau had proposed to move and adopt substantially all of these requirements to new § 1024.33(b), with a few exceptions, as explained in the section-by-section analysis below. The Bureau's proposal also would have made certain non-substantive revisions to current § 1024.21(d) to clarify existing servicing transfer requirements.<footnote ref="83">For example, the Bureau changed “consumer inquiry address,” under § 1024.21(d)(3)(ii) to an address “that can be contacted by the borrower to obtain answers to servicing transfer inquiries,” under § 1024.33(b)(4)(ii). The Bureau also changed the provision in § 1024.21(d)(3)(v) regarding “[i]nformation concerning any effect the transfer may have” on the terms of the continued availability of mortgage life or disability insurance, to a requirement in § 1024.33(d)(3)(v) to include information “[w]hether the transfer will affect” the terms or the continued availability of mortgage life or disability insurance.</footnote>
            New § 1024.33(b)(1) sets forth the general requirement to provide the servicing transfer notice. New § 1024.33(b)(2) sets forth the transfers for which a servicing transfer is not required. New § 1024.33(b)(3) sets forth the timing requirements of the notice. New § 1024.33(b)(4) sets forth the content requirements for the servicing transfer notice.

            <title>33(c)(1) Payments Not Considered Late</title>
            <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(d) provides that, during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of servicing of any federally related mortgage loan, a late fee may not be imposed on the borrower with respect to any payment on such loan and no such payment may be treated as late for any other purposes, if the payment is received by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer who should properly receive the payment) before the due date applicable to such payment. This provision is implemented through § 1024.21(d)(5). The Bureau proposed to retain that general requirement in new § 1024.33(c) by making a clarifying revision to the regulatory text— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> that such misdirected payment may not be treated as late “for any purpose.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add a qualification to that general prohibition to conform new § 1024.33(c)(1) with the requirements in new § 1024.39 by clarifying that a borrower's account may be considered late for purposes of contacting the borrower for early intervention. Proposed § 1024.39 would have required servicers to provide oral and written notices to borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options within 30 and 40 days after a missed payment, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal and is adopting § 1024.33(c)(1) substantially as proposed, except with respect to the statement referencing § 1024.39. The Bureau is adding new comment 33(c)(1)-1, to clarify that the prohibition on treating a payment as late for any purpose in § 1024.33(c)(1) includes a prohibition on imposing a late fee on the borrower with respect to any payment on the mortgage loan, with a cross-reference to RESPA section 6(d) in order to clarify that the statutory prohibition on charging late fees remains in effect notwithstanding the change to the language of the regulatory provision.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed qualifying language regarding § 1024.39 as regulatory text, but instead is adopting this language as new comment 33(c)(1)-2. New comment 33(c)(1)-2 clarifies that a transferee servicer's compliance with 1024.39 during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of a servicing transfer does not constitute treating a payment as late for purposes of § 1024.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes this provision is more appropriately located as commentary than regulatory text because it is an interpretation of the prohibition on treating a payment as late.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The early intervention rules are new requirements designed to inform delinquent borrowers about loss mitigation options. While a borrower who has made a timely but misdirected payment is not likely to benefit from information about early intervention, transferee servicers may not know the reasons for a missed payment if they are unable to establish live contact with borrowers pursuant to § 1024.39(a) (requiring that servicers establish live contact or make good faith efforts to do so by the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency). In the face of this uncertainty, transferee servicers may decide the best course of action is to comply with § 1024.39, as applicable. In these situations, the Bureau does not believe a servicer complying with § 1024.39 is treating a borrower as late within the meaning of RESPA section 6(d).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(c)(2) Treatment of Payments</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add a requirement in proposed § 1024.33(c)(2) that, in connection with a servicing transfer, a transferor servicer shall promptly either transfer a payment it has received incorrectly to the transferee servicer for application to a borrower's mortgage loan account or return the payment to the person that made the payment to the transferor servicer. The Bureau explained that many servicers already transfer misdirected payments to the appropriate servicer in connection with a servicing transfer, and the Bureau requested comment regarding whether the option to return the payment to the borrower should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported the proposed provision, but two consumer advocacy groups and a number of individual consumers requested that the Bureau require the transferring servicer to forward all payments received from borrowers after the transfer date to the appropriate servicer. Consumer groups and individual consumers were concerned that returning misdirected payments to the borrower would lead to confusion, defaults, unnecessary fees, and potentially more foreclosures. Consumer groups believed that the transferor servicer could easily pass payments on to the transferee servicer, reducing the opportunity for unnecessary harm to borrowers. Similarly, one individual consumer suggested that the borrower should be permitted to make payments to the transferor servicer during the 60 days after the transfer date. Another individual consumer recommended that the transferee servicer should be responsible for collecting payments from the transferor servicer. Another consumer recommended that transferee servicer should be required to take steps to remind the borrower to send payments to the new servicer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments received, the Bureau has decided to adopt § 1024.33(c)(2) substantially as proposed. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau believes that this requirement is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring the avoidance of unnecessary and unwarranted charges and the provision of accurate information to borrowers. Accordingly, the provision is authorized under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA.
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added clarifying language to § 1024.33(c)(2) and has made conforming edits to § 1024.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) to clarify the circumstances under which the transferor servicer must take action with respect to misdirected payments. Section 1024.33(c)(2) now provides that, beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, with respect to payments received incorrectly by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer that should properly receive the payment on the loan), the transferor servicer shall promptly take action described in either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii). The Bureau has modeled this language on the language of § 1024.33(c)(1) (payments not considered late). The Bureau does not intend any substantive difference from proposed § 1024.33(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also added language to § 1024.33(c)(2)(ii) to provide that if a servicer does not transfer a misdirected payment to the transferee servicer, the servicer must return the payment to the person that made the payment to the transferor servicer and notify the payor of the proper recipient of the payment. The Bureau believes § 1024.33(c)(2) will ensure that transferor servicers take some action with respect to misdirected payments; otherwise, transferor servicers may claim that they had no obligation with respect to misdirected payments. The Bureau also believes it is reasonable to permit transferors to either return a misdirected payment to the payor or transmit the payment to the transferee servicer because there may be circumstances in which a borrower would want to be notified that the payment had been mailed to the wrong servicer, recoup the misdirected payment, and forward it to the correct servicer. In addition, there may be situations in which a transferor servicer receives a payment from a party it does not recognize as the borrower associated with the mortgage loan account. In such situations, the Bureau believes servicers may reasonably determine the best course of action is to return such a payment to the payor. Moreover, the Bureau does not believe there is significant potential for borrower harm associated with § 1024.33(c)(2) because § 1024.33(c)(1) permits a 60-day grace period in which timely but misdirected payments to the transferor servicer may not be considered late for any purpose. In addition, § 1024.33(c)(2) requires the transferor servicer to take action with respect to the misdirected payment “promptly.” The Bureau does not agree with individual consumers who suggest that borrowers should be permitted to make payments to the transferor during the 60 days after the transfer date, or that the transferee servicer should collect payments from the transferor. While § 1024.33(c)(1) would prevent timely but misdirected payments from being treated as late, the transferor servicer's contractual right to collect payments from the borrower would likely end after a servicing transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau has added language to § 1024.33(c)(2)(ii) to require the transferor servicer to notify the payor of the proper recipient of payment. Although the servicing transfer notice will provide some notice to the borrower of a transfer, there may be situations in which the payor may be a different party than the borrower who received the transfer notice. In addition, the fact that the payment was sent to the transferor servicer would suggest that the transfer notice sent pursuant to § 1024.33(b) did not achieve its intended purpose. Thus, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to instruct the payor of the proper recipient of the payment and that borrowers will be better served by this requirement than by requiring the transferor to redirect the payment to the transferee.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to move § 1024.21(h) to new § 1024.33(d), along with several non-substantive amendments. The language of the Bureau's proposed preemption provision is substantially similar to the existing preemption provision with respect to the types of provisions of State laws or regulations preempted— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> those requiring notices to the borrower at application or transfer of servicing where the servicer or lender complies with the Bureau's servicing transfer notice provisions. The Bureau notes, however, that consistent with the discussion above, the Bureau's proposal would have expanded the coverage of the preemption provision to cover subordinate-lien mortgage loans by replacing the term “mortgage servicing loan” in the current language with references to the term “mortgage loans.” The Bureau notes that expanded coverage of the preemption provision to subordinate-lien loans is consistent with the scope of statutory preemption provision in RESPA section 6(h), which applies to “person who makes a federally related mortgage loan or a servicer.” As discussed above, the term “federally related mortgage loan” includes subordinate-lien loans. 12 U.S.C. 2602(1)(A).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received one comment from an organization of State bank regulators that requested that the Bureau omit § 1024.33(d). The organization asserted that proposed § 1024.33(d) is broader than the statutory preemption provision in RESPA section 6(h) because the proposed rule would have invalidated State laws rather than having provided that any State requirements were fulfilled by compliance with the Federal regime. The organization explained it believes RESPA section 6(h) is sufficient to address the issue of duplicative or conflicting State laws, without promulgation of implementing regulations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the organization objected to language in proposed § 1024.33(d) stating that State laws requiring notices to borrowers were preempted, “and there shall be no additional borrower disclosure requirements.” The commenter asserted that RESPA section 6(h) provides State notice laws are considered satisfied if the RESPA timing, content, and notice procedure requirements are met—not that State laws are invalidated. The commenter asserted that RESPA section 6(h) allows State laws to apply where the or servicer has not satisfied the RESPA requirements, and that State examination processes would be hampered by an interpretation that simply invalidates State law requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.33(d) as proposed. The Bureau has considered these objections but disagrees that the language of § 1024.33(d) as proposed is broader than the language of RESPA section 6(h) or will introduce new difficulties for State bank examiners. By adopting § 1024.33(d), the Bureau is maintaining substantially all of the language of § 1024.21(h), which was originally adopted by HUD through its final rule implementing RESPA section 6(h). By implementing RESPA section 6(h) through § 1024.33(d), the Bureau intends to maintain the current coverage of § 1024.21(h) as it has existed for many years. Accordingly, the Bureau disagrees that § 1024.33(d) will introduce any new complications into the State examination process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The commenter was also concerned that, by implementing RESPA section 6(h) through language similar but not identical to the statutory provision, proposed § 1024.33(d) would broaden the classes of State laws that are subject to RESPA section 6(h). The commenter focused on the omission in proposed § 1024.33(d) of the word “such” from the statutory phrase “complied with the provisions of any such State law”; and the omission of the phrase limiting the scope of RESPA section 6(h) to the “timing, content, and procedures” for notification to the borrower under RESPA section 6.<footnote ref="94">RESPA section 6(h) provides, in full: “Notwithstanding any provision of any law or regulation of any State, a person who makes a federally related mortgage loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions of &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;any such State law or regulation&lt;/em&gt; requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of the servicing of a loan if such person or servicer complies with the requirements under this section &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;regarding timing, content, and procedures for notification to the borrower&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis added). Section 1024.33(d) provides, in relevant part: &amp;#8220;A lender who makes a mortgage loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions of any State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing of a loan if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of this section.&amp;#8221;</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with the commenter's assertion that, by eliminating “such” from the statutory provision of “complied with the provisions of any <em data-original="E-03">such</em> State law” (emphasis added), the Bureau has broadened the scope of the preemption from specific State laws requiring notice to broad classes of law. Section 1024.33(d) makes clear that the State laws at issue are those requiring notice to borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing of a loan, which the Bureau believes is consistent with the types of notices identified in RESPA section 6(h). The Bureau also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that, by eliminating the statutory phrase, “regarding timing, content, and procedures for notification of the borrower” from the description of the requirements under section 6 with which a servicer must comply to trigger preemption, the Bureau has broadened the preemption provision. Section 1024.33(d) indicates that State laws and regulations are considered to be complied with if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of “this section,” which refers to the regulatory section (1024.33) containing requirements regarding timing, content, and procedures for notifying borrowers about servicing transfers. Accordingly, the omission of the phrase regarding timing, content, and procedures does not substantively alter the meaning of section 6(h) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the commenter suggested there may be tension between § 1024.33(d) and § 1024.32(b), which provides that servicers can combine disclosures required by other laws or the terms of an agreement with a Federal or State regulatory agency with the disclosures required by subpart C. The Bureau does not believe these provisions are in conflict. Paragraph 33(d) applies by its terms only to notification provisions in § 1024.33. To the extent § 1024.32(b) generally provides that servicers can combine disclosures required by other laws or the terms of an agreement with a Federal or State regulatory agency with the disclosures required by subpart C, the Bureau believes that servicers would understand that the more specific rule overrides the general rule with regard to servicing transfer disclosures.</analysisParagraph>

As part of the Bureau's proposed reorganization of Regulation X, which would have created a new subpart C to contain the Bureau's mortgage servicing rules, the Bureau proposed to move the disclosure provisions in § 1024.21(b) through (d) to new § 1024.33 and new Regulation X official interpretations. The Bureau also proposed to move the existing State law preemption provision in § 1024.21(h) to § 1024.33(d). In addition to these conforming amendments, the Bureau proposed to add certain new provisions to § 1024.33 and official commentary to § 1024.33, as discussed in more detail below.<footnote ref="77">Further, the Bureau proposed to move and amend provisions in § 1024.21(e) (pertaining to servicer responses to borrower inquiries) to new § 1024.35 (error resolution) and § 1024.36 (information requests). The Bureau's proposal also would have removed current § 1024.21(f) (damages), which had restated the damages and costs provision in RESPA section 6(f). The Bureau is removing this provision from Regulation X, which is no longer accurate following amendments to RESPA section 6(f) by section 1463(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes the damages and costs provision is more appropriate as a statutory provision.</footnote>

              <title>34(a) Timely Escrow Disbursements Required</title>
              <analysisParagraph>RESPA section 6(g) provides that, if the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the loan for deposit into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect to the property, the servicer shall make payments from the escrow account for such taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges in a timely manner as such payments become due. 12 U.S.C. 2605(g). Current § 1024.21(g) implements this provision by replicating the statutory nearly verbatim. Current § 1024.21(g) uses the term “mortgage servicing loan” in place of the statutory term “federally related mortgage loan” and includes a cross-reference to § 1024.17(k), which sets forth more detailed requirements for how escrow payments are made in a timely manner.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to incorporate the substance of current § 1024.21(g) into new § 1024.34(a) to provide that, if the terms of a mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the mortgage loan for deposit into an escrow account to pay taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges for the mortgaged property, the servicer shall make payments from the escrow account in a timely manner, that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as governed by the requirements in § 1024.17(k).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to expand the scope of current § 1024.21(g); proposed § 1024.34(a) would have replaced the term “mortgage servicing loan” with the term “mortgage loan,” which includes subordinate-lien loans. Other than this change in scope, the Bureau proposed several non-substantive technical revisions to the current provision. One commenter indicated that subordinate-lien, closed-end loans typically do not have escrow accounts. The commenter asked that the Bureau clarify whether these rules would apply to subordinate-lien loans to avoid confusion.
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision as proposed. RESPA section 6(g), and both current § 1024.21(g) and new § 1024.34(a), limit the applicability of the provision, among other things, to loans whose terms require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the loan for deposit into an escrow account to pay taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges for the mortgaged property. Thus, if a subordinate-lien mortgage loan does not require borrowers to make payments into an escrow account, § 1024.34(a) would not apply.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>As noted above, RESPA section 6(g) generally requires a servicer to make payments from an escrow account in a timely manner as payments become due. 12 U.S.C. 2605(g). Section 1463(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 6(g) by adding a provision requiring that any balance in any such account that is within the servicer's control at the time the loan is paid off be promptly returned to the borrower within 20 business days or credited to a similar account for a new mortgage loan to the borrower with the “same lender.” The Bureau proposed to add § 1024.34(b)(1) through (2) to implement this amendment to RESPA section 6(g).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.34(b)(1) would have provided that, within 20 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of a borrower's payment of a mortgage loan in full, any amounts remaining in the escrow account shall be returned to the borrower. The Bureau explained in its proposal that the Bureau interprets the 20-day allowance in RESPA section 6(g) to apply only if the servicer refunds the escrow account balance to the borrower (and not if the servicer credits a new account with the same lender, as provided in proposed § 1024.34(b)(2)).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry associations and a community bank commenter recommended that the Bureau permit servicers to net escrow funds against the payoff amount. These commenters noted that community banks frequently net escrow funds against a payoff balance, and they observed that requiring servicer to obtain a full payoff and then refund the escrow is costly and does not provide a benefit to the borrower. Another industry association commenter requested that the Bureau clarify that the borrower may direct how the escrow account funds should be applied.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on these comments and upon further consideration, the Bureau has decided to revise the proposed regulatory text and commentary. To clarify the relationship between § 1024.33(b)(1) and (b)(2), the Bureau has amended § 1024.34(b)(1) to provide that, “[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (b)(2),” a servicer shall return escrow funds to the borrower. Paragraph (b)(2) continues to give the servicer the option of applying the escrow account to the new loan in specified circumstances. Accordingly, servicers shall generally refund escrow amounts to the borrower, unless the servicer applies the escrow balance to a new account, as permitted under § 1024.33(b)(2). In addition, the Bureau has added language referring to amounts remaining in an escrow account “that is within the servicer's control” to replicate language appearing in the statutory provision. The Bureau has also made minor technical wording clarifications, but is otherwise adopting the text of § 1024.34(b)(1) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also included comment 34(b)(1)-1 to clarify that § 1024.34(b)(1) does not prohibit a servicer from netting any remaining funds in an escrow account against the outstanding balance of the borrower's mortgage loan. The Bureau interprets RESPA section 6(g), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, as only requiring servicers to return escrow balances or credit a new account after the mortgage loan is paid off. The Bureau does not believe the Dodd-Frank Act amendment to RESPA section 6(g) was intended to affect the manner in which the loan is paid off. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 34(b)(1)-1 to clarify that servicers are not prohibited under § 1024.34(b)(1) from netting any remaining funds in an escrow account against the borrower's outstanding loan balance.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>34(b)(2) Servicer May Credit Funds to a New Escrow Account</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, RESPA section 6(g) permits a servicer to credit the escrow account balance to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan to the borrower with the same lender if the servicer does not return the balance to the borrower within 20 business days. 12 U.S.C. 2605(g). To implement this provision, the Bureau proposed to add new § 1024.34(b)(2) to provide that a servicer may credit funds in an escrow account balance to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan as of the date of the settlement of the new mortgage loan if the new mortgage loan is provided to the borrower by a lender that: (i) Was also the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan.<footnote ref="95">As the Bureau explained in its proposal, the Bureau interprets the language “account with the same lender” consistent with secondary market practices. In addition, “lender” is defined in Regulation X to mean, generally, the secured creditor or creditors named in the debt obligation and document creating the lien. For loans originated by a mortgage broker that closes a federally related mortgage loan in its own name in a table funding transaction, the lender is the party to whom the obligation is initially assigned at or after settlement.</footnote>
            Thus, if the servicer credits the funds in the escrow account to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan, the credit should occur as of the settlement of the new mortgage loan. The Bureau proposed to add comment 34(b)(2)-1 to clarify that a servicer is not required to credit an escrow account balance to a new mortgage loan in any circumstance in which it would be permitted to do so. Thus, a servicer would have been permitted, in all circumstances, to return funds in an escrow account to the borrower pursuant to proposed § 1024.34(a).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters supported proposed comment 34(b)(2)-1. However, several industry associations requested that the rule include an option for the borrower to direct how the escrow account funds should be applied. One industry trade association expressed concern that RESPA section 6(g) and proposed § 1024.34 contained an ambiguity regarding the ability of a servicer to transfer funds retained in the escrow account to a new lender with the borrower's consent. This commenter noted that, while neither RESPA section 6(g) nor § 1024.34 explicitly prohibits this practice, the use of the term “same lender” in the statute and proposed § 1024.34 creates uncertainty over whether a servicer may credit any excess escrow account balances to a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan with a <em data-original="E-03">new lender</em> with the borrower's consent.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.34(b)(2) provides that, notwithstanding § 1024.34(b)(1), if the borrower agrees, a servicer may credit any amounts remaining in an escrow account that is within the servicer's control to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan as of the date of the settlement of the new mortgage loan if the new mortgage loan is provided to the borrower by a lender specified in § 1024.34(b)(2)(i) through (iii). As in the proposal, these lenders are (i) the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) the lender that is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) the lender that uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered commenters' recommendations to revise § 1024.34 to permit servicers to credit escrow accounts for loans with a new lender with the borrower's consent, but the Bureau declines to further amend proposed § 1024.34(b)(2) to expand the types of lenders with whom a borrower's new mortgage loan may be credited. The Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 6(g) to require that servicers either return remaining escrow account balances to the borrower within 20 days or credit a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan with the “same lender,” which the Bureau has interpreted to be (i) the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) the lender that is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) the lender that uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan. The Bureau believes an additional exception to permit servicers to apply remaining escrow balances to lenders who are not the “same lender” within the meaning of RESPA section 6(g) would subsume the statutory provision. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the provision in § 1024.34(b)(1) (generally requiring servicers to return remaining escrow balances to borrowers within 20 days of loan payoff) provides borrowers with sufficient flexibility to apply their funds as they wish.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.34(b)(2) to add the phrase “if the borrower agrees” to require servicers to obtain the borrower's consent before crediting an escrow balance to a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan. The Bureau has added this language to ensure borrowers are informed of and agree to a servicer's actions with respect to any remaining escrow balances if the servicer does not return the balance within 20 days under § 1024.34(b)(1). Moreover, unlike the 20-day period in which the servicer must otherwise refund escrow balances in § 1024.34(b)(1), § 1024.34(b)(2) does not require that funds be credited within a particular time frame; the Bureau believes it is appropriate to include a requirement in § 1024.34(b)(2) that the borrower agrees before the servicer takes an action that could delay the disposition of the borrower's escrow account balance. The Bureau also believes it is appropriate to include a requirement that borrowers agree to servicer actions under § 1024.34(b)(2) to avoid potential borrower confusion that might otherwise arise if a servicer did not refund an escrow balance within 20 days, as required under § 1024.34(b)(1). Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the addition of the requirement that a borrower must agree under § 1024.34(b)(2) is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to achieve the purposes of RESPA section 6(g) and to ensure responsiveness to borrower requests. This change is therefore authorized under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA. The Bureau has also made technical revisions to proposed § 1024.34(b)(2) to clarify its relationship to § 1024.34(b)(1), in light of the Bureau's revision to § 1024.34(b)(1) in this final rule.<footnote ref="96">The Bureau has added the following language to § 1024.34(b)(2): “Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section * * *”</footnote>

Finally, the Bureau is adopting comment 34(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed to clarify that a servicer is not required to credit funds in an escrow account to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan and may, in all circumstances, comply with the requirements of § 1024.34 by refunding the funds in the escrow account to the borrower pursuant to § 1024.34(b)(1).<footnote ref="97">The Bureau has made a technical correction to comment 34(b)(2)-1 to replace the proposed comment's reference to “§ 1024.34(a)” with a corrected reference to “§ 1024.34(b)(1).”</footnote>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(a) would have required a servicer to treat a qualified written request that asserts an error relating to the servicing of a loan as a notice of error subject to the requirements of § 1024.35. The Bureau intended to propose servicer obligations applicable to qualified written requests that were the same as requirements applicable to other notices of error that met the requirements for assertions of error under § 1024.35(a). One consumer group commenter expressed support for the proposal because it dispensed with technicalities about whether an assertion of error constituted a valid qualified written request. A trade association commenter said the Bureau failed to define a valid qualified written request and said that proposed § 1024.35 does not fully integrate section 6(e) of RESPA into the proposed error resolution procedures. Another trade association of private mortgage lenders said the proposal did not make clear what constitutes a qualified written request and to what extent servicers must continue to comply with existing law regarding qualified written requests. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final § 1024.31 defines the term “qualified written request.” In addition, as discussed above, the Bureau has added new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2, which clarifies that the error resolution and information request requirements in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request. Finally, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.35(a) to make clear in the final rule that a qualified written request that asserts an error relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan is a notice of error for purposes of § 1024.35 for which a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a notice of error.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Oral Notices of Error</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to require servicers to comply with the requirements under § 1024.35 for errors asserted by a borrower either orally or in writing. The Bureau believed this approach was warranted because, based on its discussions with consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and industry trade associations during outreach, the Bureau learned that the vast majority of borrower complaints are asserted orally rather than in writing. The proposal solicited comment regarding whether servicers should be required to comply with the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 for notices of error received orally.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments from both consumer groups and various industry members on this question. Consumer advocacy group commenters reiterated their support for applying the requirements under § 1024.35 to notices of error made orally, noting that consumers most often assert errors and request information orally rather than in writing. In contrast, consumer commenters on Regulation Room disfavored the proposal's application of the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 to notices of error received orally. Consumer commenters, citing their negative experiences attempting to request information from servicers orally, were concerned that encouraging an oral process would weaken consumer protections. Industry commenters also opposed the proposal's application of the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 to oral notices of error, albeit for different reasons. Industry commenters asserted that applying error resolution requirements to oral notices of error would create new burdens for servicers regarding tracking the notices of error and monitoring borrowers' receipt of written acknowledgements and responses. Industry commenters further stressed that a written process would provide more clarity and certainty as to the nature of the error the borrower asserted and the communications from the servicer to the borrower during the conversation. Further, industry commenters asserted, written notices of error would help avoid situations in which the borrower and servicer have differing recollections as to the content of the borrower's notice of error and the servicer's response during the conversation. Absent a written record, commenters said, servicers would need to record conversations with borrowers to minimize the significant litigation risk. The commenters asserted that recording conversations could be especially costly for small servicers and would require the borrower's consent in many jurisdictions. Some industry commenters also noted their belief that RESPA requires that borrowers assert errors in writing.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many of the concerns articulated by industry commenters were consistent with those expressed by small entity representatives with whom the Small Business Review Panel conducted outreach in advance of the proposal. The Small Business Review Panel recommended that the Bureau consider requiring small servicers to comply with the error resolution procedures under § 1024.35 only when borrowers asserted errors in writing.<footnote ref="99">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin.

            The Small Business Review Panel also recommended that the Bureau consider adopting a more flexible process for tracking errors and demonstrating compliance that could be used by small servicers.<footnote ref="100">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin.

          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau had anticipated many of these comments and had proposed to delimit the category of issues that could be raised through the error process to mitigate the challenges of identifying oral assertions of error. Nonetheless, after consideration of these comments and the comments received with respect to the Bureau's definition of error as discussed below, the Bureau is amending proposed § 1024.35(a) to apply the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 solely to notices of error received in writing, and the Bureau is broadening the definition of error as well. While borrowers may continue to assert errors orally, servicers will not be required to comply with the formal error resolution requirements outlined in § 1024.35 for such assertions of errors. Instead, the Bureau has added § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can investigate, respond to, and, as appropriate, make corrections in response to complaints, whether written or oral, asserted by borrowers. In addition, the Bureau has added a requirement in § 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers of the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in § 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that imposing the formal requirements under § 1024.35 only to written notices of error and addressing oral notices of error instead through the policies and procedures requirements under § 1024.38 strikes the appropriate balance between ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints and mitigating the burden on servicers of following and demonstrating compliance with specific procedures with respect to oral notices of error. The Bureau believes that the need to provide additional flexibility to servicers with respect to responding to oral notices of error is particularly necessary in light of the Bureau's further decision, as discussed below, to expand the list of covered errors under § 1024.35 to include a catch-all provision for errors relating to the servicing of mortgage loans. On the one hand, the Bureau is persuaded, for the reasons discussed further below, that it should not delimit the set of issues that consumers should be able to raise within the error resolution process. On the other hand, the Bureau also is persuaded that determining from a telephone call from a borrower to a servicer whether the borrower is asserting an error rather than simply, for example, posing a question can be challenging. Drawing this line—and triggering the investigation and response requirement with respect to errors—would be exponentially more difficult if any concern relating to the servicing of the borrower's mortgage loan could constitute an error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The final rule will thus require servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers investigate, respond to and, as appropriate, resolve oral complaints on a more informal basis, without having to follow the formal error resolution requirements, so long as the servicer has policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that borrowers are informed of the written error resolution procedures. At the same time, the final rule will provide a broader definition of errors subject to the requirements of § 1024.35.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Borrower's Representative</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 35(a)-1 would have clarified that a notice of error submitted by an agent of the borrower is considered a notice of error submitted by the borrower. Proposed comment 35(a)-1 would have further permitted servicers to undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person who claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. Several industry commenters said it would be costly and burdensome to determine whether a third party has authority to act on a borrower's behalf. Many requested clarification as to what the Bureau believes constitutes acting on the borrower's behalf. Further, some industry commenters expressed concern about potential liability for the improper release of information, including the risk of violating State or Federal privacy laws, as well as what commenters perceived to be increased risk of identity theft and fraud. Finally, a few industry commenters took the position that only the borrower, but not the borrower's agent, should be permitted to assert notices of error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA states that a qualified written request may be provided by a “borrower (or an agent of the borrower).” Thus, one consumer advocacy group commenter noted that the proposal to permit borrowers' agents to submit notices of error is consistent with the statutory requirement. Consumer groups also requested that the Bureau clarify that the timelines for error resolution will not toll during the period in which the servicer attempts to validate through reasonable policies and procedures that a third party purporting to act on a borrower's behalf is, in fact, an agent of the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed comment 35(a)-1 to address servicers' concerns about potential liability for the improper release of information. The final comment clarifies that servicers may have reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring purported agents to provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat a notice of error as having been submitted by the borrower. The Bureau acknowledges that requiring servicers to respond to error notices submitted by borrowers' agents is more costly than limiting the requirement to borrowers' notices, but notes that this approach is consistent with section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA with respect to a qualified written request. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints, to apply this requirement to all written notices of error, especially since borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or in dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau declines to define further the term “agent.” The concept of agency has historically been defined under State or other applicable law. Thus, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable State law regarding agents.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(b)(3) would have included as an error a servicer's failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt, where such failure results in a charge to the consumer or the furnishing of negative information to a consumer reporting agency. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b)(3) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to the allocation of payments for a borrower's account and other standard servicer duties. A failure to credit a payment as of the date of receipt may have implications for the correct application of borrower payments. A servicer's failure to credit a payment promptly may cause the servicer to report to a borrower improper information regarding the amounts owed by the borrower and may cause a servicer to misapply other payments received by the borrower. Further, a servicer's failure to credit borrower payments promptly may generate improper late fees and other charges. The Bureau further believes that prompt crediting of borrower payments is a standard servicer duty as set forth in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA. The Bureau also observes that prompt crediting of borrower payments is, by definition, servicing and, therefore, is subject to the qualified written request procedure set forth in section 6(e) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau noted in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, prompt crediting of payments to consumers is required by section 129F of TILA, which was added by section 1464 of the Dodd-Frank Act and will be implemented by § 1026.36(c)(1) in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. For a mortgage loan secured by a principal dwelling, TILA section 129F mandates that servicers shall not fail to credit a payment to a consumer's loan account as of the date of receipt, except when a delay in crediting does not result in any charge to the consumer, or in the furnishing of negative information to a consumer reporting agency. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1639f. TILA section 129F provides a specific exception for payments that do not conform to a servicer's written requirements, but nonetheless are accepted by the servicer, in which case the servicer shall credit the payment as of five days after receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1639f(b). Servicers of mortgage loans covered by TILA section 129F have a duty to comply with that provision.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A credit union and a non-bank servicer commented on proposed § 1024.35(b)(3). The credit union requested greater flexibility as to payments received outside of the servicer's operating hours or at the end of the business day. The non-bank servicing company requested clarification that the proposal was not intended to impact servicers' ability as to scheduled interest loans to credit an account as of the receipt date and apply payment as of the scheduled due date. The Bureau believes § 1024.35(b)(3) as proposed would have provided servicers sufficient flexibility to credit payments, as it would have limited errors to where the failure to credit a payment as of the date of receipt results in a charge to consumers or furnishing of negative information to a credit reporting agency. Nevertheless, the Bureau recognizes that there would be little consumer benefit to subjecting servicers to potentially overlapping standards as to prompt crediting of borrowers' accounts. At the same time, for those loans that are not subject to TILA section 129F, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to extend the requirements of that provision beyond the scope mandated by Congress, as implemented by § 1026.36(c)(1) of the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the proposed language in final § 1024.35(b)(3) to make clear that a servicer's failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt is an error only in those circumstances in which the failure to credit as of the date of receipt would contravene § 1026.36(c)(1). Final § 1024.35(b)(3) defines as an error the failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt in violation of 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(1). Because servicers will already be required to comply with § 1026.36(c)(1) with respect to certain mortgage loans they service, the Bureau does not believe that defining their failure to do so as an error imposes additional burden on servicers.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(b)(4) would have included as an error a servicer's failure to make disbursements from an escrow account for taxes, insurance premiums, or other charges, including charges that the borrower and servicer have voluntarily agreed that the servicer should collect and pay, as required by current § 1024.17(k) and proposed § 1024.34(a), or to refund an escrow account balance in a timely manner as required by proposed § 1024.34(b). The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b)(4) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to the allocation of payments for a borrower's account and other standard servicer duties.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the normal course of business, servicers typically engage in collecting payments from borrowers to fund escrow accounts and disburse payments from escrow accounts to pay borrower obligations for taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges. Servicers typically undertake this obligation on behalf of investors because a borrower's maintenance of an escrow account reduces risk for investors that unpaid taxes may generate tax liens that are higher in priority than a lender's mortgage lien and that unpaid insurance may cause lapses in insurance coverage that present risk for investors in the event of a loss. Servicers are required to make disbursements from escrow accounts in a timely manner pursuant to section 6(g) of RESPA and are required to account for the funds credited to an escrow account pursuant to section 10 of RESPA. In addition, the proper disbursement of escrow funds is, by definition, servicing and, therefore, is currently subject to the qualified written request procedure set forth in section 6(e) of RESPA and current § 1024.21(e) of Regulation X. A credit union commenter agreed that proposed § 1024.35(b)(4) should constitute an error.

The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b)(5) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to standard servicer duties. The Bureau believes that it is a typical servicer duty, both to the borrower and to the servicer's principal, to ensure that the servicer has a reasonable basis to impose a charge on a borrower.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that servicers should not impose fees on borrowers that are not bona fide—that is, fees that a servicer does not have a reasonable basis to impose upon a borrower. Examples of non-bona fide charges include such common sense errors as late fees for payments that were not late, default property management fees for borrowers that are not in a delinquency status that would justify the charge, charges from service providers for services that were not actually rendered with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account, and charges for force-placed insurance in circumstances not permitted by final rule § 1024.37.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Improper fees harm both mortgage loan borrowers and the investors that are mortgage servicers' principals. Improper and uncorrected fees harm borrowers by taking funds that may otherwise be used to keep a mortgage loan current. Further, improper fees reduce recovery values available to investors from foreclosures or loss mitigation activities. Servicers that operate in good faith in the normal course of business refrain from imposing charges on borrowers that the servicer does not have a reasonable basis to impose and correct errors relating to those fees when they arise.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters asserted that the term “reasonable basis” is open to interpretation and thus urged the Bureau to further define the term or to otherwise provide additional clarification.

The Bureau intended through this provision to implement TILA section 129G, which was added by section 1464 of the Dodd-Frank Act and which requires that a creditor or servicer of a home loan send an accurate payoff balance amount to the borrower within a reasonable time, but in no case more than seven business days after the receipt of a written request for such balance from or on behalf of a borrower. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b)(6) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to a final balance for purposes of paying off a mortgage loan and standard servicer duties.</analysisParagraph>

A payoff statement is necessary any time a borrower repays a mortgage loan, and servicers routinely provide payoff statements for borrowers to refinance or pay in full their mortgage loan obligations. However, consumer advocates have indicated that servicers have failed, or refused, to provide payoff statements to certain borrowers or have required borrowers to make a payment on a mortgage loan as a condition of fulfilling the borrower's request for a payoff statement.<footnote ref="103">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., Mortgage Servicing: An Examination of the Role of Federal Regulators in Settlement Negotiations and the Future of Mortgage Servicing Standards: Joint Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Fin.

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that borrowers may benefit from asserting errors with respect to a servicer's failure to provide information regarding loss mitigation options that may be available to the borrower but for which the servicer has not provided information to the borrower. By correcting such errors and providing the borrower with accurate information regarding such loss mitigation options, a servicer can help a borrower receive an evaluation for available loss mitigation options pursuant to § 1024.41 and to potentially receive an offer of such an option, which may be mutually beneficial to the borrower and the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau believes that the National Mortgage Settlement, servicer participation in Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and HUD, and servicer participation in other loss mitigation programs required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac demonstrate that, at present, servicers typically provide borrowers with information regarding loss mitigation options and foreclosure and that providing such information to borrowers is a standard servicer duty.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One non-bank servicer and one credit union commented on proposed § 1024.35(b)(7). Both advocated against inclusion of a servicer's failure to provide information regarding loss mitigation options as an error subject to error resolution procedures under § 1024.35. The credit union asserted that lenders are incentivized to provide accurate loss mitigation information, as they try to avoid foreclosing upon properties.</analysisParagraph>

Further, the Bureau notes that the failure of a servicer to provide accurate information will create liability under this section only if the servicer fails to correct the error when called to its attention. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(b)(7) as proposed, except that the Bureau has removed the reference to § 1024.40 in light of other changes to the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(b)(8) would have included as an error a servicer's failure to accurately and timely transfer information relating to a borrower's mortgage loan account to a transferee servicer. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b)(8) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to standard servicer duties.
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the accurate and timely transfer of information relating to a borrower's mortgage account is a standard servicer duty. In the normal course of business, servicers typically anticipate that they will be required to transfer servicing for some mortgage loans they service. Owners or assignees of mortgage loans typically have rights to transfer servicing for a mortgage loan pursuant to the requirements set forth in mortgage servicing agreements. Servicers generally are required to develop capacity for transferring information to transferee servicers in order to comply with such obligations to owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, servicers generally are required to develop capacity to download data for transferred mortgage loans onto the servicer's servicing platform. Borrowers may be harmed, however, if information that is transferred to transferee servicers is not accurate, current, or is not properly captured by a transferee servicer. In certain circumstances, such failure may cause errors to occur relating to allocating payments, calculating final balances for purposes of paying off a mortgage loan, or avoiding foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of facilitating servicing transfers. Specifically, § 1024.38(b)(4)(i) provides that as a transferor servicer, a servicer must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the timely transfer of all information and documents in the possession or control of the servicer relating to a transferred mortgage loan to a transferee servicer in a form and manner that ensures the accuracy of the information and enables a transferee servicer to comply with its obligations to the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 1024.35(b)(8), a servicer's failure to accurately and timely transfer information relating to a borrower's mortgage loan account to a transferee servicer would constitute an error. The Bureau believes that by defining an error in this way, a borrower will have a remedy to ensure that a transferor servicer provides information to a transferee servicer that accurately reflects the borrower's account consistent with the obligations applicable to a servicer's general servicing policies and procedures. The Bureau did not receive comment regarding § 1024.35(b)(8) and is adopting it as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(g) provided that a servicer that offers loss mitigation options to borrowers in the ordinary course of business would be prohibited from proceeding with a foreclosure sale when a borrower has submitted a complete application for a loss mitigation option by a specified date unless the servicer denies the borrower's application for a loss mitigation option (including any appeal thereof), the borrower rejects the servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option, or the borrower fails to perform on a loss mitigation agreement. These requirements are discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis for § 1024.41 below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A credit union commenter asserted that failure to suspend a foreclosure sale in the circumstances described in proposed § 1024.41(g) should not be considered an error subject to the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 because, the commenter reasoned, a lender will delay foreclosure when there is a legitimate need to do so. Having considered the comment, and as explained with respect to § 1024.41, the Bureau continues to believe it is appropriate to prohibit a servicer from completing the foreclosure process until after a borrower has had a reasonable opportunity to submit an application for a loss mitigation option and the servicer has completed the evaluation of the borrower for a loss mitigation option, and that a borrower should be able to assert an error where a servicer fails to comply with these procedures.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>New § 1024.35(b)(11) includes a catch-all that applies error resolution procedures to errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. As discussed above, the Bureau solicited comment regarding whether the list of covered errors should include a catch-all provision. The Bureau also requested comment as to whether to add additional specific errors to the list of errors under § 1024.35. In particular, the Bureau solicited comment regarding whether to include as an error a servicer's failure to correctly evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the inclusion of a limited list of errors, citing certainty, clarity, and notice as its primary benefits. Consumer group commenters generally opposed limiting notices of error to a finite list. Consumer advocates asserted that the proposal was a departure from and offered fewer consumer protections than the existing qualified written request process under section 6 of RESPA, which applies to all errors relating to servicing. In addition, some consumer group commenters noted the fluid nature of mortgage servicing and cautioned that a finite list lacks the flexibility necessary to ensure that consumers will be adequately protected as servicing practices evolve.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As to whether the Bureau should add additional specific errors to the list of covered errors, some consumer groups suggested the addition of specific errors, including errors relating to escrow accounts, servicing transfer, disclosures, and loss mitigation, while also reiterating their support for a broad catch-all provision. While most industry commenters said the proposed list of covered errors was adequate, a credit union commenter suggested that the Bureau add requests to cancel liens once accounts have been paid in full. Both consumer groups and industry commented regarding whether to include a servicer's failure to correctly evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option as an error. One consumer group urged the Bureau to do so, asserting that because the Dodd-Frank Act requires servicers to take timely action to correct errors relating to avoiding foreclosure, the plain language of the statute suggests that borrowers should be able to assert errors related to loss mitigation before they get to the point of a foreclosure sale. The commenter further contended that the appeals process set forth in proposed § 1024.41(h) will not hold servicers sufficiently accountable for uncorrected errors. The commenter said that borrowers need a statutory remedy for uncorrected errors. Another consumer group advocated for a catch-all sufficiently broad to capture the array of servicer loss mitigation duties. An industry association took the opposing view, citing concerns about the inability to objectively measure whether a servicer evaluated a borrower for an option correctly. The industry commenter requested that should the Bureau add this category as a covered error, the Bureau also clarify that a servicer who complies with § 1024.41 has not committed the error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the appeals process set forth in § 1024.41(h) provides an effective procedural means for borrowers to address issues relating to a servicer's evaluation of a borrower for a loan modification program. For this reason, and the reasons stated below with respect to loss mitigation practices, the Bureau declines to add a servicer's failure to correctly evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option as a covered error in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, adding new § 1024.35(b)(11), which includes a catch-all that defines as an error subject to the requirements of § 1024.35 errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. The Bureau believes that any error related to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan also relates to standard servicer duties. The Bureau also agrees with consumer advocacy commenters that the mortgage market is fluid and constantly changing and that it is impossible to anticipate with certainty the precise nature of the issues that borrowers will encounter. The Bureau, therefore, believes that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to craft error resolution procedures that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to changes in the mortgage market and to encompass the myriad and diverse types of errors that borrowers may encounter with respect to their mortgage loans. At the same time, the Bureau believes the costs and burdens created by having a more expansive definition of error are significantly mitigated because, as discussed above, under the final rule the requirements under § 1024.35 apply only to written notices of error. Moreover, the final rule adopts a process that is consistent with the existing process for responding to qualified written requests under RESPA section 6, which likewise includes a catch-all for servicing-related errors. The Bureau declines to add additional covered errors beyond the catch-all.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>35(b) Scope of Error Resolution</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to “qualified written requests” asserting errors or requesting information relating to the servicing of a federally-related mortgage loan. Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add section 6(k)(1)(C), which states that a servicer shall not “fail to take timely action to respond to a borrower's request to correct errors relating to allocation of payments, final balances for purposes of paying off the loan, or avoiding foreclosure, or other standard servicer's duties.” The Bureau believes that standard servicer duties are those typically undertaken by servicers in the ordinary course of business. Such duties include not only the obligations that are specifically identified in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA, but also those duties that are defined as “servicing” by RESPA, as implemented by this rule, as well as duties customarily undertaken by servicers to investors and consumers in connection with the servicing of a mortgage loan. These standard servicer duties are not limited to duties that constitute “servicing,” as defined in this rule, and include, for example, duties to comply with investor agreements and servicing program guides, to advance payments to investors, to process and pursue mortgage insurance claims, to monitor coverage for insurance (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> hazard insurance), to monitor tax delinquencies, to respond to borrowers regarding mortgage loan problems, to report data on loan performance to investors and guarantors, and to work with investors and borrowers on options to mitigate losses for defaulted mortgage loans.<footnote ref="101">In providing these examples, the Bureau is making no judgment regarding whether they fall within the meaning of “servicing” as defined in this rule.</footnote>

                <title>Limited List</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(b) to implement section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA. Proposed § 1024.35(b) set forth a limited list of errors to which the error resolution provisions would apply. The Bureau proposed a limited list because it believed such a list would provide certainty to both borrowers and servicers regarding the types of errors that are subject to the error resolution process. Further, as discussed above, the Bureau believed a limited list would enable servicers to allocate resources to respond to errors in a manner that would ultimately benefit borrowers. The Bureau also considered that it was proposing to require servicers to respond to both oral and written error notices and information requests in compressed time periods. Finally, the Bureau considered the feedback the Small Business Review Panel received from small entity representatives regarding whether the error resolution procedures should include a catch-all provision to the enumerated list of errors. In general, small entity representatives commented favorably on the Bureau's proposal to delimit the list of errors.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment regarding whether the list of errors to which error resolution procedures would apply should include a catch-all provision or be limited to an enumerated list. Industry commenters supported the establishment of a limited list of errors, noting certainty, clarity, and notice as its primary benefits. Consumer group commenters generally opposed limiting notices of error to an enumerated list. Consumer advocates asserted that the proposal was a departure from and offered fewer consumer protections than the existing qualified written request process under section 6 of RESPA, which incorporates a catch-all provision for errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. Some consumer advocates noted the reference in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA to “standard servicer's duties,” and argued that the catch-all provision should likewise cover all errors relating to “standard servicer's duties.” In addition, some consumer group commenters noted the fluid nature of mortgage servicing and cautioned that a limited list of covered errors lacks the flexibility necessary to ensure that consumers will be adequately protected as servicing practices evolve.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments, and as discussed further below, the Bureau has decided to revise proposed § 1024.35(b) to include a catch-all that includes as an error errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. In addition, as discussed below, final § 1024.35(b) substantively retains the enumerated errors listed in the proposal. The Bureau believes revising proposed § 1024.35(b) in this manner is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints in light of the fluidity of the mortgage market and the inability to anticipate in advance and delineate all types of errors related to servicing that borrowers may encounter, and which should be subject to the error resolution process under § 1024.35 to prevent borrower harm. At the same time, the Bureau believes that the costs and burdens created by having a more expansive definition of the term error are significantly mitigated because, as discussed above, the final rule applies error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 only to written assertions of error. Moreover, the final rule implements an error resolution process that is consistent with the existing process for responding to qualified written requests under RESPA section 6, which includes a catch-all for servicing-related errors.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Covered Errors</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 35(b)-1, which would have clarified that a servicer would not be required to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e) if a notice related to something other than one of the types of errors in proposed § 1024.35(b). The proposed comment provided examples of categories of excluded errors that would not be considered covered errors pursuant to proposed § 1024.35(b). These included matters relating to the origination or underwriting of a mortgage loan, matters relating to a subsequent sale or securitization of a mortgage loan, and matters relating to a determination to sell, assign, or transfer the servicing of a mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the proposed exclusion, noting that the categories the Bureau proposed to exclude are unrelated to servicing and largely beyond servicers' knowledge. Some consumer group commenters objected that the proposed exclusions were overly broad. The Bureau believes that a mortgage servicer is generally not in a position to investigate or resolve borrower complaints regarding potential errors that may have occurred during an origination, underwriting, sale, or securitization process. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 35(b)-1 substantially as proposed. The final comment clarifies that, in addition to § 1024.35(d) and (e), servicers need not comply with § 1024.35(i) with respect to a borrower's assertion of an error that is not defined as an error in § 1024.35(b). Final comment 35(b)-1 also includes a clarification that the failure to transfer accurately and timely information relating to a borrower's loan account to a transferee servicer is an error for purposes of § 1024.35, while matters relating to an initial determination to transfer servicing are not.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A trade association of reverse mortgage lenders also commented regarding the scope of the error resolution procedures, urging the Bureau to exclude reverse mortgages from the scope of covered error. Having considered this comment, the Bureau notes that servicers of reverse mortgage transactions are already subject to the qualified written request procedures set forth in section 6(e) of RESPA and § 1024.21(e) of Regulation X. Likewise, pursuant to final § 1024.30, the error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 apply to reverse mortgage transactions that are mortgage loans, as that term is defined in final § 1024.31. Accordingly, to the extent that a borrower asserts an error under § 1024.35 that is applicable to such a reverse mortgage, the servicer shall comply with error resolution procedures as to the error. For example, because § 1024.30 generally excludes servicers of reverse mortgage transactions from § 1024.41, errors asserted under § 1024.35(b)(9) and (10), discussed below, are not applicable to reverse mortgage transactions.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>35(c) Contact Information for Borrowers To Assert Errors</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(c), which would have permitted a servicer to establish an exclusive telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error. If a servicer chose to establish a separate telephone number and address for receiving errors, the proposal would have required the servicer to provide the borrower a notice that states that the borrower may assert an error at the telephone number and address established by the servicer for that purpose. Proposed comment 35(c)-1 would have clarified that if a servicer has not designated a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error, then the servicer will be required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error received by any office of the servicer. Proposed comment 35(c)-2 would have further clarified that the written notice to the borrower may be set forth in another written notice provided to the borrower, such as a notice of transfer, periodic statement, or coupon book. Proposed comment 35(c)-2 would have further clarified that if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address for receipt of notices of error, the servicer must provide that telephone number and address in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to allow servicers to establish a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error in order to allow servicers to direct oral and written errors to appropriate personnel that have been trained to ensure that the servicer responds appropriately. As the proposal noted, at larger servicers with other consumer financial service affiliates, many personnel simply do not typically deal with mortgage servicing-related issues. For instance, at a major bank servicer, a borrower might assert an error to local bank branch staff, who likely would not have access to the information necessary to address their error. Thus, the Bureau reasoned, if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address that a borrower must use, a servicer would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements for errors that may be received by the servicer through a different method.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters favored allowing servicers to designate an address and telephone number to which borrowers must direct error notices. At the same time, such commenters asserted that creating an exclusive intake portal was not sufficient to offset the burdens inherent in permitting oral error notices to which error resolution requirements apply. Some commenters said that designating telephone lines for error notices could be especially costly for small servicers. Thus, one community bank trade association argued that the proposal favored large institutions. Two industry commenters requested clarification regarding how servicers must treat error notices sent to the wrong address. Finally, one credit union commenter asserted that servicers should only be required to include designated telephone numbers and addresses in regular forms of communication to borrowers, such as the periodic statement. In contrast, consumer group commenters suggested that to the extent a servicer designates a telephone line or address, the servicer should be required to post such information on its Web site and to include it in mailed notices.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Because the final rule removes the requirement that servicers comply with error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 for oral notices of error, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to regulate the circumstances under which servicers may direct oral errors to an exclusive telephone number that a borrower must use to assert an error. However, for written error notices, the Bureau continues to believe that it is reasonable to permit servicers to designate a specific address for the intake of notices of error. Allowing a servicer to designate a specific address is consistent with current requirements of Regulation X with respect to qualified written requests. Current § 1024.21(e)(1) permits a servicer to designate a “separate and exclusive office and address for the receipt and handling of qualified written requests.” Moreover, the Bureau believes that identifying a specific address for receiving errors and information requests will benefit consumers. By providing a specific address, servicers will identify to consumers the office capable of addressing errors identified by consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is critical for servicers to publicize any designated address to ensure that borrowers know how properly to assert an error and to avoid evasion by servicers of error resolution procedures. This is especially important because, as noted in the proposal, servicers who designate a specific address for receipt of error notices are not required to comply with error resolution procedures for notices sent to the wrong address. Accordingly, final § 1024.35(c) requires servicers that designate an address for receipt of notices of error to post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the Web site lists any contact address for the servicer. In addition, final comment 35(c)-2 retains the clarification that servicers that establish an address that a borrower must use to assert an error, must provide the address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance. The Bureau is otherwise adopting § 1024.35(c) and comments 35(c)-1 and 35(c)-2 as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provisions permitting servicers to designate a telephone number that a borrower must use to assert an error and clarified that the notice to the borrower must be written.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Multiple Offices</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(c) also included language that would have required a servicer to use the same telephone number and address it designates for receiving notices of error for receiving information requests pursuant to proposed § 1024.36(b), and vice versa. Further, the Bureau proposed comment 35(c)-3, which would have clarified that any telephone numbers or address designated by a servicer for any borrower may be used by any other borrower to submit a notice of error. For instance, if a servicer set up regional call centers, it would have had to assist any borrowers who called in to a particular center to complain about an error, regardless of whether the borrower called the correct region.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One non-bank servicer expressed concern about the proposal's requirement to designate the same address and telephone number for notices of error and information requests. The commenter explained that it assigns separate teams to address information requests and error notices. Thus, the commenter asserted, proposed § 1024.35(c) would negatively impact customer service. Having considered this comment, the Bureau notes that it proposed § 1024.35(c) because it was concerned that designating separate telephone numbers and addresses for notices of error and information requests could impede borrower attempts to submit notices of error and information requests to servicers due to debates over whether a particular communication constituted a notice of error or an information request. For the reasons set forth above and in the proposal, final § 1024.35(c) maintains the requirement that servicers designate the same address for receipt of notices of error and information requests. In addition, the Bureau is adopting comment 35(c)-3 as substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has removed references to error notices received by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 35(c)-5 to further clarify that a servicer may use automated systems, such as an interactive voice response system, to manage the intake of borrower calls. The proposal provided that prompts for asserting errors must be clear and provide the borrower the option to connect to a live representative. Because the final rule does not require servicers to comply with error resolution procedures for oral error notices, the Bureau is withdrawing proposed comment 35(c)-5 from the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Internet Intake of Notices of Error</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 35(c)-4 to clarify that a servicer would not be required to establish a process for receiving notices of error through email, Web site form, or other online methods. Proposed comment 35(c)-4 was intended to further clarify that if a servicer establishes a process for receiving notices of error through online methods, the servicer can designate it as the only online intake process that a borrower can use to assert an error. A servicer would not be required to provide a written notice to a borrower in order to gain the benefit of the online process being considered the exclusive online process for receiving notices of error. Proposed comment 35(c)-4 would have further clarified that a servicer's decision to accept notices of error through an online intake method shall be in addition to, not in place of, any processes for receiving error notices by phone or mail.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter advocated requiring servicers to establish on online process for receipt of error notices. The Bureau agrees that online processes have significant promise to facilitate faster, cheaper communications between borrowers and servicers. However, the Bureau believes that this suggestion raises a broader issue around the use of electronic media for communications between servicers (and other financial service providers) and borrowers (and other consumers). The Bureau believes it would be most effective to address this issue in that larger context after study and outreach to enable the Bureau to develop principles or standards that would be appropriate on an industry-wide basis. The Bureau is therefore, at this time, finalizing language to permit, but not require, servicers to elect whether to adopt such a process. The Bureau intends to conduct broader analyses of electronic communications' potential for disclosure, error resolution, and information requests after the rule is released. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 35(c)-4 as proposed, with minor technical amendments, and the Bureau has removed references to error notices received by telephone.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>35(d) Acknowledgment of Receipt</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(d), which would have required a servicer to provide a borrower an acknowledgement of a notice of error within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receiving a notice of error. Proposed § 1024.35(d) would have implemented section 1463(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended the current acknowledgement deadline of 20 days for qualified written requests to five days. Proposed § 1024.35(d) would have further implemented the language in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA prohibiting the failure to take timely action to respond to requests to correct errors by applying the same timeline applicable to a qualified written request to any notice of error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, including multiple credit union associations, requested that the Bureau lengthen the acknowledgment time period, asserting that five days is unreasonable, especially for smaller institutions. A nonprofit mortgage servicer said the timeframe is insufficient for its small volunteer staff. An industry trade association commenter argued that the acknowledgment requirement creates unnecessary paperwork and should be removed from the final rule altogether. In contrast, consumer group commenters were generally supportive of the acknowledgment requirement, noting that the timeline in the proposal was consistent with that in the Dodd-Frank Act for qualified written requests.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that acknowledgment within five days is appropriate given that the Dodd-Frank Act expressly adopts that requirement for qualified written requests and differentiating between the two regimes would increase operational complexity. Moreover, the burden on servicers is significantly mitigated by the fact that the error resolution procedures are only applicable to written notices of error. The Bureau further notes that the contents of the acknowledgment are minimal. In addition, servicers need not provide an acknowledgment if the servicer corrects the error identified by the borrower and notifies the borrower of that correction in writing within five days of receiving the error notice. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(d) substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provision to clarify that the acknowledgment must be written.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A) would have required a servicer that does not determine after a reasonable investigation that no error occurred as set forth under § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(B), to correct the error identified by the borrower, and provide the borrower with notification that indicates that the error was corrected, the date of the correction, and contact information the borrower can use to get further information. One industry commenter asserted that RESPA does not require that servicers provide correction dates and questioned the utility of such a requirement. The commenter further requested clarification as to whether the date of correction was equivalent to the effective date of the correction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not intend the reference to the date of correction in § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A) to refer to the date the correction was made by the servicer, but rather to the date the correction is made effective. Accordingly, the Bureau is amending proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A) to add the word “effective” to the final rule in order to clarify that the date servicers must provide is the effective date of the correction. The Bureau believes that providing the effective date of the correction is meaningful information for a borrower to assess whether the servicer has satisfactorily corrected the error, particularly in cases involving changes to the balance of the borrower's account. Commenters did not comment on other aspects of proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A), and the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A) as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the final rule to clarify that the notification must be provided in writing and the servicer's contact information must include a telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(B) would have required a servicer that determines after conducting a reasonable investigation that no error occurred to provide the borrower a notice stating that the servicer has determined that no error has occurred, the reason(s) the servicer believes that no error has occurred, and contact information for servicer personnel that can provide further assistance. The proposal would have also required the servicer to inform the borrower in the notice that the borrower may request documents relied on by the servicer in reaching its determination and how the borrower can request such documents. In contrast, proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(A) would not have required a servicer who determines that an error has occurred and corrects the error to provide a statement in the notice to the borrower about requesting documents that were the basis for that determination.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter requested that the Bureau amend the proposed rule to address situations in which servicers make inaccurate determinations that no error occurred. The Bureau believes that, as proposed, the rule adequately addresses such scenarios by requiring disclosures about borrowers' rights to request the information on which the servicer relied, so as to facilitate the borrower's opportunity to review and consider further action as appropriate. The Bureau believes that the rule will facilitate the timely correction of errors and that borrowers are less likely to need documents and information when errors are corrected per the borrower's requests. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(1)(i)(B) as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provision to clarify that the notification must be written and the servicer's contact information must include a telephone number.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 35(e)(1)(i)-1 to clarify that if a notice of error asserts multiple errors, a servicer may respond to those errors through a single or separate written responses that address the alleged errors. The Bureau believes that the purpose of the rule, which is to require timely resolution of errors, is facilitated by allowing a servicer to respond to multiple errors set forth in a single notice of error through separate communications. For example, a servicer could correct one error and send a notice regarding the correction of that error, while an investigation is in process regarding another error that is the subject of the same notice of error. The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding proposed comment 35(e)(1)(i)-1 and is adopting it as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Different or Additional Error</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(ii), which provided that if a servicer, during the course of a reasonable investigation, determines that a different or additional error has occurred, the servicer is required to correct that different or additional error and to provide a borrower a written notice about the error, the corrective action taken, the effective date of the corrective action, and contact information for further assistance. Because the servicer would be correcting an error, a servicer would not be required to provide a notice to the borrower about requesting documents that were the basis for that determination for the reasons discussed above. Proposed comment 35(e)(1)(ii)-1 would have clarified that a servicer may provide the response required by § 1024.35(e)(1)(ii) in the same notice that responds to errors asserted by the borrower pursuant to § 1024.35(e)(1)(i) or in a separate response that addresses the different or additional errors identified by the servicer. The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding proposed § 1024.35(e)(1)(ii) and comment 35(e)(1)(ii)-1 and is adopting both substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that a consumer protection purpose of RESPA is to facilitate the timely correction of errors. Where a servicer discovers an actual error, this purpose is best served by requiring the servicer to correct that error subject to the same procedures that would have applied had the borrower asserted the same error through a qualified written request or notice of error. Accordingly, the Bureau finds that § 1024.35(e)(1)(ii) is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including of facilitating the timely correction of errors.

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(2) would have permitted a servicer to request that a borrower provide documentation if needed to investigate an error but would not have permitted a servicer to require the borrower to provide such documentation as a condition of investigating the asserted error. Further, proposed § 1024.35(e)(2) would have prohibited a servicer from determining that no error occurred simply because the borrower failed to provide the requested documentation. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(e)(2) to allow servicers to obtain information that may assist in resolving notices of error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters stressed the importance of permitting reasonable requests for information from borrowers. Commenters said that limiting servicers' access could impede the early resolution of errors. One industry commenter asked that the Bureau clarify that servicers may request documents so long as they do not condition investigation on the receipt of documents. Other commenters requested clarification that requiring a borrower to provide specific information about what the borrower is requesting does not constitute requiring a borrower to provide information as a condition of conducting the investigation.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the Bureau believes the proposed rule strikes the right balance by permitting servicers to request documents from borrowers so long as the servicer's investigation and conclusion that no error occurred is not dependent on the receipt of documents. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the process for servicers to obtain information from borrowers should not prejudice the ability of the borrower to seek the resolution of the error. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(2) as proposed with minor technical amendments.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(i), which would have required a servicer to respond to a notice of error not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the borrower notifies the servicer of the asserted error, with two exceptions: Errors relating to accurate payoff balances and errors relating to failure to suspend a foreclosure sale where a borrower has submitted a complete application for a loss mitigation option. As discussed further below, the proposal would have required servicers to respond to errors relating to payoff balances within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error. The Bureau believed this shortened timeframe was appropriate because a servicer's failure to correct such an error may prevent a borrowing from pursuing options in the interim, such as a refinancing transaction. The proposal would have also required servicers to respond to errors relating to the failure to suspend a foreclosure sale where a borrower has submitted a complete application the earlier of within 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the error notice or prior to the foreclosure sale. The Bureau believed the shorter timeline was appropriate because delaying the response and investigation until after the foreclosure sale could cause irreparable harm to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>While several industry commenters asserted that 30 days was insufficient for error notices, one credit union stated that the timeline was reasonable. Similarly, a consumer group commenter noted that the timeline was consistent with the time period for qualified written requests required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room asserted that the timelines were too generous. The Bureau believes that the 30-day timeframe proposed is appropriate given that the Dodd-Frank Act expressly changed the timeframe for qualified written requests from 60 days to 30 days and differentiating between two regimes would increase operational complexity as well as burden on borrowers and servicers. Accordingly, the final rule adopts the 30-day timeline as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Shortened Time Limit To Correct Errors Relating to Payoff Balances</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(A) would have provided that if a borrower submits a notice of error asserting that a servicer has failed to provide an accurate payoff balance as set forth in proposed § 1024.35(b)(6), a servicer must respond to the notice of error not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the borrower notifies the borrower of the alleged error. The Bureau proposed the accelerated timeframe because it believed that a 30-day deadline for responding to this type of notice of error would not provide adequate protection for borrowers because the servicer's failure to correct the error promptly may prevent a borrower from pursuing options in the interim such as a refinancing transaction. Moreover, discussions with servicers during outreach suggested that a five day timeframe would be reasonable for a servicer to correct an error with respect to calculating a payoff balance.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters noted the complexity involved in calculating payoff balances, especially where servicers need to collect information from third parties, such as fee information from vendors or prior servicers. In light of the complexity involved, industry commenters asserted that the timeframe was insufficient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau continues to believe it is important to have an accelerated timeline for errors associated with payoff balances, the Bureau acknowledges that in some circumstances the need to collect information from third parties may pose timing challenges. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(A) to provide that a servicer must respond to a borrower's notice of error asserting that a servicer has failed to provide an accurate payoff balance as set forth in § 1024.35(b)(6) not later than seven days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the borrower notifies the servicer of the alleged errors. The Bureau believes that this modest increase in the timeline strikes the right balance between prompt provision of payoff information to consumers and the need for servicers to have sufficient time to access the required information. Moreover, the Bureau also notes that section 129G of TILA requires servicers to provide accurate payoff balance amounts to consumers within a reasonable time, but in no case more than seven business days. Otherwise, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(A) as proposed, with minor technical amendments.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) would have provided that if a borrower submits a notice of error asserting, under § 1024.35(b)(9), that a servicer has failed to suspend a foreclosure sale, a servicer would be required to investigate and respond to the notice of error by the earlier of 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) or the date of a foreclosure sale. Proposed comment 35(e)(3)(i)(B)-1 would have clarified that a servicer could maintain a 30-day timeframe to respond to the notice of error if it cancels or postpones the foreclosure sale and a subsequent sale is not scheduled before the expiration of the 30-day deadline.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the shortened timeframe is appropriate because, given the complexity of the process, servicers may mistakenly fail to suspend a foreclosure. Thus, the Bureau believes borrowers may reasonably benefit from the opportunity to have servicers investigate and respond to notices of error regarding such failures before the foreclosure sale. The Bureau believes that a timeframe that allowed a servicer to investigate and respond to the notice of error after the date of a foreclosure sale would cause irreparable harm to a borrower. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) and comment 35(e)(3)(i)(B)-1 as proposed, except for minor technical amendments and that the Bureau has revised § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) to reference both § 1024.35(b)(9) and (10).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Extensions of Time Limit</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii) would have permitted, subject to certain exceptions discussed below, a servicer to extend the time period for investigating and responding to a notice of error by 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) if, before the end of the 30-day period set forth in proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(C), the servicer notifies the borrower of the extension and the reasons for the delay in responding. Proposed comment 35(e)(3)(ii)-1 would have clarified that if a notice of error asserts multiple errors, a servicer may extend the time period for investigating and responding to those errors for which extensions are permissible pursuant to proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>While some consumer groups generally objected to the proposed extension, one industry commenter urged the Bureau to permit two automatic 15-day extensions. The Bureau does not believe that permitting a second 15-day extension would promote timely resolution of errors. Section 1463(c)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6(e) of RESPA to provide one 15-day extension of time with respect to qualified written requests, and the Bureau believes that differentiating between two regimes would increase operational complexity.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not propose to apply the extension allowance of proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii) to investigate and respond to errors relating to a servicer's failure to provide an accurate payoff statement or to suspend a foreclosure sale. As discussed above, the final rule applies a shortened timeframe for responding to such errors in light of special statutory provisions and special considerations at the foreclosure stage. Permitting a 15-day extension of those timeframes would negate these shortened response periods and undermine the purposes served by shortening them. For the reasons set forth above and in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii) and comment 35(e)(3)(ii)-1 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(e)(4) would have required that, where a servicer determines that no error occurred and a borrower requests the documents the servicer relied upon, the servicer must provide the documents within 15 days of the servicer's receipt of the borrower's request. The Bureau proposed comment 35(e)(4)-1 to clarify that a servicer would need only provide documents actually relied upon by the servicer to determine that no error occurred, not all documents reviewed by a servicer. Further, the proposed comment stated that where a servicer relies upon entries in its collection systems, a servicer may provide print-outs reflecting the information entered into the system.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters questioned the utility of providing documents relied upon to borrowers, noting that borrowers may not understand how to interpret the documents printed from servicers' systems. Industry commenters said providing such documents will be burdensome, and one commenter added that the Dodd-Frank Act neither requires nor contemplates such a requirement. One commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that servicers need only provide borrowers a summary of information that is stored electronically and not in a producible format. And several industry commenters urged the Bureau to limit servicers' responsibility to provide documents that reflect trade secrets or other sensitive information.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the proposed rule strikes the right balance in that it does not subject servicers to undue paperwork burden but assures that borrowers will have access to underlying documentation if necessary. In certain cases, a borrower may determine that the servicer's response resolves an issue and that reviewing documents would be unnecessary. Thus, the Bureau believes that requiring a servicer to provide documents only upon a borrower's request limits burden. The Bureau understands that servicers may store information electronically and not in a readily producible format. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting final comment 35(e)(4)-1, which clarifies that servicers may provide a printed screen capture in such situations, as proposed with minor technical amendments. In addition, the Bureau acknowledges industry commenters' concern regarding providing confidential or sensitive information to borrowers. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.35(e)(4) to provide that servicers need not produce to borrowers documents reflecting confidential, proprietary or privileged information. Final § 1024.35(e)(4) further provides that if a servicer withholds documents relied upon because such documents reflect confidential, proprietary or privileged information, the servicer must notify the borrower of its determination in writing.

            <title>35(f)(1) Early Correction</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(f)(1) to permit alternative compliance as to errors resolved within the first five days. This provision is consistent with section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA, which requires servicers to provide written acknowledgment of a qualified written request within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) “unless the action requested is taken within such period.” In addition, the alternative compliance mechanism in proposed § 1024.35(f)(1) was based on feedback from servicers during outreach, and especially small servicers, which indicated that the majority of errors are addressed promptly after a borrower's communication and generally within five days. Small entity representatives communicated to the Small Business Review Panel that small servicers have a high-touch customer service model, which made it very easy for borrowers to report errors or make inquiries, and to receive real-time responses. The Bureau believed the alternative compliance method was necessary and appropriate to reduce the unwarranted burden of an acknowledgement and other response requirements on servicers, and especially small servicers, that are able to correct borrower errors within five days consistent with the Small Business Review Panel recommendation that the Bureau consider requirements that provide flexibility to small servicers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the proposal's exemption of servicers from complying with paragraphs (d) and (e) where the servicer corrects the error identified by the borrower within five days of receiving the notice of error. However, industry commenters opposed the requirement that servicers notify borrowers of the correction in writing. Commenters reasoned that a significant number of errors are asserted and quickly resolved in a single telephone call. Accordingly, commenters argued that the requirement to advise borrowers of the correction in writing would be burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that because the final rule subjects written but not oral notices to error resolution requirements under § 1024.35, the commenters' concerns regarding written notice of correction has been significantly mitigated. To the extent that a borrower asserts an error in writing which the servicer resolves within five days, the Bureau believes the borrower will benefit from receiving the written notification. For these reasons, the Bureau adopts § 1024.35(f)(1) as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provision to make clear that the servicer must provide such notification within five days of receiving the notice of error.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As explained in proposed § 1024.35(f)(2), the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to streamline acknowledgment and response requirements when servicers receive a notice of error that may impact a foreclosure sale less than seven days before a foreclosure sale. Notices of errors identified in § 1024.35(b)(9) and (10), which focus on the failure to suspend a foreclosure sale in the circumstances described in § 1024.41(f), (g), or (j), implicate this concern. Numerous entities, including other federal agencies and small entity representatives during the Small Business Review Panel outreach, expressed concern about borrower use of error resolution requirements as a procedural tool to impede proper foreclosures and promote litigation.<footnote ref="104">See U.S. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, Final Report of the Small Business Review Panel on CFPB’s Proposals Under Consideration for Mortgage Servicing Rulemaking, 30 (Jun, 11, 2012).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated concerns heard during pre-proposal outreach that borrowers could use the error resolution requirements to halt foreclosure sales, including minutes before a foreclosure sale. One industry commenter stressed that in some circumstances, whether to proceed with foreclosure will be beyond the servicer's control, as some courts will not cancel foreclosure after a certain date and Freddie Mac can override a servicer's request to postpone or cancel a sale. Thus, two commenters urged the Bureau to exempt from liability servicers required by an investor, insurer, guarantor or legal requirement to proceed with a foreclosure sale. Another industry commenter requested an exception for those borrowers who have had their claims heard by a court, asserting that servicers need finality and that extending foreclosure timelines is costly. In contrast, consumer group commenters opposed the alternative compliance option for errors asserted within seven days of a foreclosure sale. Consumer groups asserted that servicers should be required to communicate with borrowers in writing. In addition, some consumer group commenters reasoned that because proposed § 1024.35(f)(2) would exempt the servicer from the requirement to conduct an investigation or provide the borrower with the documents relied upon in reaching its determination that no error occurred, it would effectively permit servicers to ignore valid requests for postponement so long as the servicer sends a letter stating that no error occurred.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the final rule provides that for error notices submitted seven days or less before a foreclosure sale that assert an error identified in § 1024.35(b)(9) or (10), servicers are not required to comply with the requirements for acknowledgement and response to notices of error, but must make a good faith attempt to respond to borrowers, orally or in writing, and to either correct the error or state the reason the servicer has determined no error occurred. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that reducing the procedural requirements for servicers to follow for such notices mitigates the concern that borrowers may use error resolution procedures to impede foreclosure, while maintaining protection for consumers. The Bureau believes that this alternative compliance method is also consistent with the Small Business Review Panel recommendation that the Bureau provide flexibility to small servicers and responds to small entity representatives' concern that error resolution procedures may be used in unwarranted litigation. Further, the Bureau understands the timing to be consistent with the GSE requirement that servicers conduct account reviews to document that all required actions have occurred at least seven days prior to a foreclosure sale. The Bureau declines to revise the proposal to require that servicers communicate with borrowers in writing, as the Bureau believes servicers require flexibility in communicating with borrowers close in time to a foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>35(f) Alternative Compliance</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(f) provided that a servicer would not be required to comply with the timing and process requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of proposed § 1024.35 in two situations. First, a servicer that corrects the error identified by the borrower within five days of receiving the notice of error, and notifies the borrower of the correction in writing, would not be required to comply with the acknowledgment, notice and inspection requirements in paragraphs (d) and (e). Because such errors are corrected, an investigation would not be required. Second, a servicer that receives a notice of error for failure to suspend a foreclosure sale, pursuant to § 1024.35(b)(9), seven days or less before a scheduled foreclosure, would not be required to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e), if, within the time period set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B), the servicer responds to the borrower, orally or in writing, and corrects the error or states the reason the servicer has determined that no error has occurred.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>35(g)(1)(i)</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(i) would have provided that a servicer is not required to comply with the notice of error requirements in proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e) with respect to a notice of error to the extent that the asserted error is substantially the same as an error asserted previously by or on behalf of the borrower for which the servicer had previously complied with its obligation to respond to the notice of error pursuant to § 1024.35(e)(1), unless the borrower provides new and material information. The proposed rule would have defined new and material information as information that was not reviewed by the servicer in connection with investigating the prior notice of error and was reasonably likely to change a servicer's determination with respect to the existence of an error.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that both elements of this requirement are important. First, the information must not have been reviewed by the servicer. If the information was reviewed by the servicer, then such information is not new and requiring a servicer to re-open an investigation will create unwarranted burden and delay. Second, even if the information is new, it must be material to the asserted error. A servicer may not have reviewed information because the information may not have been material to the error asserted by the borrower. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(i) to ensure that a servicer is not required to expend resources conducting duplicative investigations of notices of error unless there is a reasonable basis for re-opening a prior investigation because of new and material information.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 35(g)(1)(i)-1 to further clarify that a dispute regarding whether a servicer previously reviewed information or whether a servicer properly determined that information reviewed was not material to its determination of the existence of an error, will not itself constitute new and material information and, consequently, does not require a servicer to re-open a prior, resolved investigation of a notice of error.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>While industry commenters supported the proposed exclusion, some consumer groups expressed concern. One consumer group commenter argued that the proposal effectively requires that borrowers describe alleged errors with more specificity than is appropriate, given that borrowers often do not fully understand the nature of the alleged error. Another consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to require servicers to inform borrowers that servicers will reconsider a duplicative error notice to the extent that the borrower is able to more concisely describe an alleged error. Another commenter asserted that the proposed exclusion shields servicers from the consequences of incompletely addressing a notice of error the first time it is received. Finally, an anonymous commenter questioned the Bureau's authority to create the exclusion altogether.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the Bureau believes that § 1024.35(g)(1)(i), as proposed, strikes the appropriate balance in that it requires servicers to respond to duplicative error notices only to the extent that such notices present new and material information. The Bureau recognizes that borrowers will assert errors in lay terms, and this section is not intended to require any particular level of specificity in the errors that borrowers assert. All that this section provides is that if a borrower submits a second error claim that the servicer reasonably determines is substantially the same as a previous submission, the servicer is not obligated to go back through the investigative process unless the borrower has presented new and material information. Thus, to the extent that a borrower initially lacks sufficient information to articulate clearly an alleged error but is later privy to new and material information that enables the borrower to describe the error more clearly, proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(i) requires a servicer to reconsider new and material information subsequently put forward by the borrower. Thus, for the reasons outlined in the proposal and set forth above, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(g)(1)(i) and comment 35(g)(1)(i)-1 as proposed, with minor technical amendments.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's authority for § 1024.35 is addressed above. Moreover, the Bureau finds that § 1024.35 is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints because the Bureau believes that this purpose will best be met if servicers are not required to waste resources responding to duplicative requests that will not benefit consumers, but rather are allowed to focus their resources on responding to error requests where such responses are most likely to result in consumer benefit.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii) would have provided that a servicer is not required to comply with the notice of error requirements in proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e) with respect to a notice of error that is overbroad or unduly burdensome. The proposed rule would have defined “overbroad” and “unduly burdensome” for this purpose. It would have provided that a notice of error is overbroad if a servicer cannot reasonably determine from the notice of error the specific covered error that a borrower asserts has occurred on a borrower's account. The proposed rule would have provided that a notice of error is unduly burdensome if a diligent servicer could not respond to the notice of error without either exceeding the maximum timeframe permitted by § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii) or incurring costs (or dedicating resources) that would be unreasonable in light of the circumstances. The proposed rule would have further clarified that if a servicer can identify a proper assertion of a covered error in a notice of error that is otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome, a servicer is required to respond to the covered error submissions it can identify. Finally, the Bureau proposed comment 35(g)(1)(ii)-1 to set forth characteristics that may indicate if a notice of error is overbroad or unduly burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>During pre-proposal outreach, consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and servicing industry representatives indicated to the Bureau that consumers do not typically use the current qualified written request process to resolve errors. During the Small Business Review Panel outreach, small entity representatives expressed that typically qualified written requests received from borrowers were vague forms found online or forms used by advocates as a form of pre-litigation discovery. Servicers and servicing industry representatives indicated that these types of qualified written requests are unreasonable and unduly burdensome. Small entity representatives in the Small Business Review Panel outreach requested that the Bureau consider an exclusion for abusive requests, or requests made with the intent to harass the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment regarding whether a servicer should not be required to undertake the error resolution procedures in proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e) for notices of error that are overbroad or unduly burdensome. Industry commenters supported the exclusion, but urged the Bureau to remove the requirement that servicers identify valid assertions of error in submissions that are otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome. Industry commenters said servicers should not be required to parse through such submissions to locate a clear assertion of error. One large trade association of mortgage servicers said that the requirement effectively subsumes the exclusion. Consumer group commenters generally disfavored the exclusion. One commenter questioned the assertion that borrowers primarily use qualified written requests to obtain prelitigation discovery. One consumer group said the exclusion gives servicers too much discretion. Another said it requires borrowers to state the basis for their alleged error with too much specificity. An anonymous consumer advocate said a request from a single borrower should not be so voluminous as to be burdensome for servicers to respond. Another consumer group commenter requested that the Bureau address situations in which the servicer erroneously determines that a submission is overbroad or unduly burdensome. Finally, one consumer group commenter said the proposed exclusion for unduly burdensome notices of error leaves borrowers unprotected as to errors that are especially egregious or complex.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In proposing § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii), the Bureau did not intend to frustrate consumers' ability to assert actual complex errors and to have such errors investigated and corrected, as appropriate, by servicers. The Bureau believes it is critical that consumers have a mechanism by which to have complex errors addressed. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii) and proposed comment 35(g)(1)(ii)-1 to remove references to unduly burdensome notices of error. At the same time, the Bureau proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii), in part, because the Bureau believes that requiring servicers to respond to overbroad notices of error from some borrowers may cause servicers to expend fewer resources to address other errors that may be more clearly stated and more clearly require servicer attention. As discussed above, the Bureau expands the definition of errors subject to the requirements of § 1024.35 to contain a catch-all for all errors relating to the servicing of the borrower's loan. Given the breadth of the errors subject to the requirements of § 1024.35, the Bureau continues to believe that a requirement for servicers to respond to notices of error that are overbroad may harm consumers and frustrate servicers' ability to comply with the new error resolution requirements. The Bureau does not believe that the error resolution procedures are the appropriate forum for borrowers to prosecute wide-ranging complaints against mortgage servicers that are more appropriate for resolution through litigation. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii) and comment 35(g)(1)(ii)-1 substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provisions to remove references to unduly burdensome notices of error.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii) would have provided that a servicer is not required to comply with the notice of error requirements in proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e) for an untimely notice of error—that is, a notice of error received by a servicer more than one year after either servicing for the mortgage loan that is the subject of the notice of error was transferred by that servicer to a transferee servicer or the mortgage loan amount was paid in full, whichever date is applicable. The Bureau proposed this provision to set a specific and clear time that a servicer may be responsible for correcting errors for a mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii) to achieve the same goal that currently exists in Regulation X with respect to qualified written requests. Specifically, current § 1024.21(e)(2)(ii) states that “a written request does not constitute a qualified written request if it is delivered to a servicer more than one year after either the date of transfer of servicing or the date that the mortgage servicing loan amount was paid in full, whichever date is applicable.”</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association expressed support for proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii). A credit union commenter requested that the Bureau impose an additional time limitation on borrowers' ability to assert errors, noting that it often services mortgages for the life of the loan. A consumer advocacy group commenter disagreed with proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii) and asserted that borrowers should be permitted to raise errors with their current servicer regardless of whether the servicer was responsible for the error. Having considered these comments, the Bureau declines to impose additional time limits on a borrower's ability to assert errors, as borrowers may discover errors long after such errors were made. In addition, the Bureau does not believe that § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii), as proposed, prohibits a borrower from raising errors with the borrower's current servicer. Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(g)(1)(iii) as proposed with a minor technical amendment.</analysisParagraph>

Specifically, subject to certain exceptions, a servicer need not comply with error resolution requirements with respect to a notice of error that asserts an error that is substantially the same as an error asserted previously by or on behalf of the borrower, that is overbroad or unduly burdensome, or that is untimely. A servicer would be liable to the borrower for its unreasonable determination that any of the listed categories apply and resulting failure to comply with proposed § 1024.35(d) and (e), however. Industry commenters generally favored the proposed exclusions, but requested that the Bureau expand the categories for which servicers would not be required to comply with error resolution requirements. Except as discussed below, the Bureau declines to do so. The Bureau has, however, revised proposed § 1024.35(g)(1) to state that, in addition to § 1024.35(d) and (e), a servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.35(i) if a servicer reasonably determines that §§ 1024.35(g)(i), (ii), or (iii) apply.</analysisParagraph>

The servicer must send the notice not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after its determination and the notice must set forth the basis upon which the servicer has made the determination, noting the applicable provision of proposed § 1024.35(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One credit union trade association disfavored the proposed requirement that a servicer send a notice informing the borrower that an error falls into one of the enumerated exceptions.

                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(g)(2) because it believes that borrowers should be notified that a servicer does not intend to take any action on the asserted error.

              <title>35(h) Payment Requirements Prohibited</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(h) would have prohibited a servicer from charging a fee, or requiring a borrower to make any payment that may be owed on a borrower's account, as a condition of investigating and responding to a notice of error. Proposed comment 35(h)-1 would have clarified that § 1024.35(h) does not alter or otherwise affect a borrower's obligation to make payments owed pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(h) for three reasons. First, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(B) to RESPA, which prohibits a servicer from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests. Proposed § 1024.35(h) would implement that provision with respect to qualified written requests. Second, the Bureau believes that a servicer's practice of charging for responding to a notice of error impedes borrowers from pursuing valid notices of error and that the prohibition is therefore necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints. Third, the Bureau understands that, in some instances, servicer personnel have demanded that borrowers make payments before the servicer will correct errors or provide information requested by a borrower. The Bureau believes that a servicer should be required to correct errors notwithstanding the payment status of a borrower's account. A consumer advocacy group commenter noted, without elaborating, that it supported the fee prohibition reflected in proposed § 1024.35(h). For the reasons set out above, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.35(h) and comment 35(h)-1 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Adverse Information</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.35(i)(1) would have provided that a servicer may not furnish adverse information regarding any payment that is the subject of a notice of error to any consumer reporting agency for 60 days after receipt of a notice of error. RESPA section 6(e) sets forth this prohibition on servicers with respect to a qualified written request that asserts an error. Proposed § 1024.35(i)(1) would implement section 6(e) of RESPA with respect to qualified written requests and would apply the same requirements to other notices of error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to maintain the prohibition regarding supplying adverse information for the 60-day timeframe set forth in section 6(e)(3) of RESPA with respect to qualified written requests and to apply it to all notices of error. Even though a notice of error may be resolved by no later than 45 days after it is received pursuant to proposed § 1024.35(e)(3)(ii), the Bureau reasoned that the 60-day timeframe is appropriate in the event that there are follow-up inquiries or additional information provided to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters strongly objected to the 60-day reporting prohibition. Commenters said the proposal undermines the accuracy and integrity of credit reports. One commenter said the Fair Credit Reporting Act already governs credit reporting. One large bank commenter asserted that because credit reporting is a safety and soundness protection, banks have a duty to accurately report delinquencies. Several industry commenters also noted a concern that, based on prior experience, borrowers may use the reporting prohibition to manipulate the system by disputing legitimate delinquencies in order to apply for credit without derogatory marks on credit reports. The Bureau acknowledges the concerns expressed but notes that Congress specifically imposed the 60-day reporting prohibition with respect to qualified written requests in section 6(e) of RESPA. As discussed above, the Bureau believes it is necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to ensure responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints and the provision of accurate and relevant information to borrowers, to apply the same procedures to all notices of error as applicable to qualified written requests. Otherwise, borrowers and servicers must expend wasteful resources parsing the form requirements applicable to qualified written requests and navigating between two separate regulatory regimes. As detailed above, the Bureau believes that the interests of borrowers and servicers are best served and the purposes of RESPA are best met through a single regulatory regime applicable to both qualified written requests and other notices of error. The Bureau is therefore adopting § 1024.35(i)(1) as proposed, as it is consistent with the 60-day reporting prohibition for qualified written requests required by section 6(e) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau proposed one exception to § 1024.35(i)(2) where a borrower asserts an error under paragraph (b)(9) based on a servicer's failure to suspend a foreclosure sale in the circumstances described in proposed § 1024.41(g). The Bureau proposed § 1024.35(i)(2) to clarify that, in general, a notice of error could not be used to require a servicer to suspend a foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A consumer group commenter asserted that proposed § 1024.35(i)(2) should be amended to prohibit a lender or servicer from pursuing a foreclosure sale upon receipt of any notice of error that disputes a servicers' ability to foreclose. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the purpose of RESPA of ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints would be impeded by allowing a notice of error to obstruct a lender's or servicer's ability to pursue remedies permitted by the applicable mortgage loan instrument.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The requirements in proposed § 1024.41 establish procedures that servicers must follow for reviewing loss mitigation applications.

Further, a servicer has the opportunity to retain its remedies when a borrower submits a completed application for a loss mitigation option. A servicer may establish a deadline by which a borrower must submit a completed application for a loss mitigation option, and, so long as the servicer fulfills its duty to evaluate the borrower for a loss mitigation option before the date of a foreclosure sale, a servicer may comply with the requirements of § 1024.35 without suspending the foreclosure sale.

            <title>Section 1024.35 Error Resolution Procedures</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to borrowers' “qualified written requests” that relate to the servicing of a loan, and § 6(k)(1)(B) of RESPA, added by the Dodd-Frank Act, separately prohibits servicers from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests. Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add new servicer prohibitions regarding borrowers' assertions of error and requests for information. Specifically, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(C) to RESPA, which states that a servicer shall not “fail to take timely action to respond to a borrower's requests to correct errors relating to allocation of payments, final balances for purposes of paying off the loan, or avoiding foreclosure, or other standard servicer's duties.” In addition, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(D) to RESPA which states that a servicer shall not fail to provide information regarding the owner or assignee of a borrower's loan within ten business days of a borrower's request. Neither Dodd-Frank Act provision suggests that a borrower request to correct an error or for information regarding the owner or assignee of the borrower's loan must be in the form of a “qualified written request” to trigger the new servicer prohibitions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As explained in the proposal, the Bureau believed that both borrowers and servicers would be best served if the Bureau were to clearly define a servicer's obligation to correct errors or respond to information requests as required by RESPA sections 6(k)(1)(C) and (D) and the RESPA provisions regarding qualified written requests. Thus, the Bureau proposed to establish comprehensive, parallel requirements for servicers to respond to specified notices of error and information requests. The Bureau proposed § 1024.35 to set forth the error resolution requirements that servicers would be required to follow to respond to errors asserted by borrowers. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36 to set forth the information request requirements that servicers would be required to follow to respond to requests for information from borrowers. In doing so, the Bureau intended to establish servicer procedural requirements for error resolution and information requests that are consistent with the requirements applicable to a “qualified written request” that relates to the servicing of a loan under RESPA. Rather than create overlapping regimes that might confuse and frustrate both borrowers and servicers alike, the Bureau intended to create a uniform regulatory regime by subsuming the qualified written request rules in the new regime established and authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act for notices of error and requests for information more generally. The Bureau believed such a single regulatory regime would reduce the burden on both borrowers and servicers who otherwise would expend wasteful resources navigating between two separate regulatory regimes and parsing form requirements applicable to qualified written requests. To that end, the Bureau proposed to delete current § 1024.21(e), the existing regulations concerning qualified written requests, and provide instead that a qualified written request asserting an error or requesting information regarding the servicing of a mortgage loan would be subject to the new provisions governing notices of error and information requests, as applicable.<footnote ref="98">Notably, a notice of error may also constitute a direct dispute under Regulation V, which implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if it complies with the requirements in 12 CFR 1022.43.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau understands that the majority of borrower complaints are submitted orally, the Bureau proposed that both written and oral notices of error would be subject to the error resolution provisions. At the same time, the Bureau recognized that permitting oral error notices would significantly expand servicers' responsibility to respond to notices of error. To enable servicers to allocate resources to respond to errors in a manner that would benefit borrowers, the Bureau proposed a limited list of errors to which the error resolution provisions would apply. As discussed in more detail below, industry commenters were unanimously opposed to applying error resolution requirements under proposed § 1024.35 to errors asserted orally. Consumer advocacy group commenters expressed support for applying the requirements under § 1024.35 to oral error notices, but were strongly opposed to the proposal to limit those errors subject to error resolution procedures under proposed § 1024.35 to a finite list. Industry commenters supported inclusion of a limited list. Based on the Bureau's consideration of these comments and the analysis below, the final rule does not require servicers to comply with error resolution procedures under § 1024.35 for oral notices of error. At the same time, the final rule includes a catch-all provision that defines as an error subject to the error resolution procedures under § 1024.35 errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. Moreover, the final rule provides that a servicer's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to provide information to borrowers who are not satisfied with the resolution of a complaint or request for information submitted orally of the procedures for submitting written notices of error and information requests.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some credit unions, community banks and their trade associations asserted that the Bureau should exempt small servicers from error resolution requirements under § 1024.35 and information request requirements under § 1024.36. Commenters argued that small servicers effectively communicate with borrowers regarding complaints and information requests, and especially disfavored the proposed requirement that small servicers respond to oral notices of error and information requests. In contrast, a consumer advocacy group commenter asserted that exempting small servicers would be inappropriate, as all servicers should be capable of complying with error resolution and information request requirements. Having carefully considered these comments, the Bureau declines to exempt small servicers from error resolution procedures under § 1024.35 and information request procedures under § 1024.36. As discussed above, §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36, as finalized, do not require servicers to comply with such procedures for oral submissions by borrowers. In light of this adjustment, final §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 primarily provide clarification as to existing obligations under RESPA and Regulation X. Moreover, the burden on all servicers is significantly mitigated. For these reasons, and the reasons discussed below, the Bureau declines to exempt small servicers from error resolution and information request procedures.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(a) Information Requests</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.36(a) would have required a servicer to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1024.36 for an information request from a borrower that includes the borrower's name, enables the servicer to identify the borrower's mortgage loan account, and states the information the borrower is requesting for the borrower's mortgage loan account. The Bureau received no comment on this aspect of proposed § 1024.36, and is finalizing these requirements as proposed. The Bureau is otherwise finalizing proposed § 1024.36 as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Qualified Written Requests</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Similar to the proposed requirements for notices of error, proposed § 1024.36(a) would have required a servicer to treat a qualified written request that requests information relating to the servicing of a loan as an information request subject to the requirements of § 1024.36. The Bureau intended to propose servicer obligations applicable to qualified written requests that were the same as requirements applicable to information requests under § 1024.36(a). One consumer group commenter expressed support for the proposal because it dispensed with technicalities about whether an information request constituted a valid qualified written request. One trade association commenter said the Bureau failed to define a valid qualified written request and said that proposed § 1024.36 does not fully integrate section 6(e) of RESPA into the proposed information request procedures. Another trade association of private mortgage lenders said the proposal did not make clear what constitutes a qualified written request and to what extent servicers must continue to comply with existing law regarding qualified written requests. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final § 1024.31 defines the term “qualified written request.” In addition, as discussed above, the Bureau has added new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2, which clarifies that the error resolution and information request requirements in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request. Finally, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1024.36(a) to make clear in the final rule that a qualified written request that requests information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan is a request for information for purposes of § 1024.36 for which a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a request for information.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Oral Information Requests</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to require servicers to comply with information request procedures under § 1024.36 for information requests made by borrowers orally or in writing. The Bureau believed this approach was warranted, in part, because discussions with consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and industry trade associations during outreach suggested that the vast majority of borrowers orally request information from servicers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As was the case for notices of error, the Bureau believed that a requirement that an information request be in writing would serve as a barrier that could unduly restrict the ability of borrowers to have errors resolved and requests fulfilled. At the same time, the Bureau recognized the burdens on servicers to ensure compliance with the proposed rule with respect to oral information requests. The Bureau believed that elements of the proposed rule would assist in mitigating servicer burden. For example, the Bureau considered that the proposal allowed servicers to designate a specific telephone number for receiving oral information requests and included an alternative compliance provision that allows a servicer to provide information orally if the information is provided within five days of the borrower's request.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau learned from pre-proposal discussions with servicers, including the small entity representatives in the Small Business Review Panel outreach, that most information requests are responded to by servicers either on the same telephone call with the borrower or within an hour of a borrower's communication. The Bureau believed that allowing servicers to respond to information requests orally would significantly reduce the burden associated with the proposed information request requirements on servicers. Further, the Bureau believed that this requirement provided flexibility for small servicers consistent with the recommendations of the Small Business Review Panel and mitigates concerns by the small entity representatives regarding compliance costs.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment regarding whether servicers should be required to comply with information request procedures for information requests asserted orally. The Bureau received a number of comments from both consumer groups and various industry members. Consumer group commenters reiterated their support for applying the information request provisions to requests made orally, noting that consumers most often request information orally rather than in writing. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room disfavored the proposal's application of the information request procedures under § 1024.36 to information requests received orally. Consumer commenters, citing their negative experiences attempting to request information from servicers orally, were concerned that encouraging an oral process would weaken consumer protections. Industry commenters also opposed the proposal's application of the information request requirements to oral information requests. Commenters said doing so would create new burdens for servicers regarding tracking the information requests and monitoring that a borrower receives written acknowledgements and responses. Industry commenters further stressed that a written process would provide more clarity and certainty as to the nature of the request and what the servicer communicated to the borrower during the conversation. Further, industry commenters asserted, requiring written information requests would help avoid situations in which the borrower and servicer have differing recollections as to the borrower's request and the servicer's response during the conversation. Absent a written record, commenters said, servicers would need to record conversations with borrowers to minimize the significant litigation risk. The commenters asserted that recording conversations could be especially costly for small servicers and would require the borrower's consent in many jurisdictions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed § 1024.36(a) to require servicers to comply with § 1024.36 solely with respect to written requests for information. While borrowers may continue to raise information requests orally, servicers will not be required to comply with the formal requirements outlined in § 1024.36 for such requests. Instead, the Bureau has added to the final rule § 1024.38(b)(1)(iii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that servicers provide borrowers with accurate and timely information and documents in response to borrowers' requests for information. In addition, the Bureau has added a requirement in § 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers about the availability of procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in § 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement under proposed § 1024.36(a) for servicers to comply with the requirements under § 1024.36 with respect to oral requests for information from borrowers and instead requiring servicers to develop policies and procedures to ensure responsiveness to such oral requests and inform borrowers about the availability of the written process, strikes the appropriate balance between providing prompt responses to borrower requests and mitigating servicer burden. The final rule will thus require servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to assure that the servicers respond to oral information requests on a more informal basis, without having to comply with all of the required steps for a formal information request under § 1024.36. As discussed more fully below, because only written information requests will be subject to the procedures outlined in § 1024.36, the Bureau believes it is logical and appropriate to require servicers to respond to such written requests in writing.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Borrower's Representative</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA states that a qualified written request may be provided by a “borrower (or an agent of the borrower).” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> RESPA section 6(e)(1)(A). The Bureau proposed comment 36(a)-1 to clarify that this standard applies to all information requests, irrespective of whether they are qualified written requests. Specifically, proposed comment 36(a)-1 would have clarified that a servicer should treat an information request submitted by a person acting as an agent of the borrower as if it received the request directly from the borrower. Further, proposed comment 36(a)-1 stated that servicers may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters said it would be costly and burdensome to determine whether a third party has authority to act on a borrower's behalf. Many requested clarification as to what the Bureau believes constitutes acting on the borrower's behalf. Further, some industry commenters expressed concern about potential liability for the improper release of information, including the risk of violating State or Federal privacy laws, as well as what commenters perceived to be increased risk of identity theft and fraud. Finally, a few industry commenters took the position that only the borrower, but not the borrower's agent, should be permitted to request information pursuant to § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One consumer advocacy group noted that the proposal to permit borrowers' agents to submit information requests is consistent with the statutory language. Consumer groups also requested that the Bureau clarify that the timelines will not toll during the period in which the servicer attempts to validate through reasonable policies and procedures that a third party purporting to act on a borrower's behalf is, in fact, an agent of the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed comment 36(a)-1 to address servicers' concerns about potential liability for the improper release of information. The final comment clarifies that servicers may have reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that purported agents provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat a request for information as having been submitted by the borrower. The Bureau acknowledges that requiring servicers to respond to information requests submitted by borrowers' agents is more costly than limiting the requirement to borrowers' requests, but notes that this approach is consistent with section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA with respect to a qualified written request. The Bureau finds that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints, to apply this requirement to all written information requests, especially since borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau declines to further define the term “agent.” The concept of agency has historically been defined in State and other applicable law. Thus, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable State law regarding agents.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Information Subject to Information Request Procedures</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to qualified written requests that request information relating to the servicing of a loan. Proposed § 1024.36(a) would have provided that any information requested by a borrower with respect to the borrower's mortgage loan is subject to the information request requirements in proposed § 1024.36 other than as provided in proposed § 1024.36(f), which defined specific circumstances in which a servicer is not obligated to comply with information request procedures.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter expressed concern that borrowers or their attorneys may abuse the information request process. The commenter said that borrowers may request information that should already be in the borrower's possession, such as information received at closing. The commenter also urged the Bureau not to require that servicers produce the servicing file in response to a borrower's information request. The commenter said that such information will be of limited utility to borrowers and often reflects privileged communications. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final § 1024.36, like the proposal, has mechanisms in place to limit abuse and to protect confidential communications. Specifically, as discussed more fully below, § 1024.36(f) lists circumstances under which servicers need not comply with information request requirements under § 1024.36. To the extent that a borrower requests a servicing file, the servicer shall provide the borrower with a copy of the information contained in the file subject to the limitations set forth in § 1024.36(f).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Another commenter requested clarification as to whether consumers may use the information request process to request payoff statements. The Bureau is amending proposed § 1024.36(a) to make clear that servicers need not treat borrowers' requests for payoff balances as requests for information for which servicers must comply with the information request procedures set forth in § 1024.36. The Bureau believes that this revision is appropriate, as borrowers already have a mechanism by which to request payoff balances under section 129G of TILA with respect to home loans. For those loans that are not subject to section 129G of TILA, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to extend the requirements of that provision beyond the scope mandated by Congress, as implemented by § 1026.36(c)(3) of the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Owner or Assignee</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add section 6(k)(1)(D), which states that a servicer shall not fail to provide information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan within ten business days of a borrower's request. Proposed comment 36(a)-2 would have clarified that if a borrower requests information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, a servicer complies with its obligations to identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by identifying the entity that holds the legal obligation to receive payments from a mortgage loan. Proposed comments 36(a)-2.i and 36(a)-2.ii would have provided examples of which party is the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan for different forms of mortgage loan ownership. These include situations when a mortgage loan is held in portfolio by an affiliate of a servicer, when a mortgage loan is owned by a trust in connection with a private label securitization transaction, and when a mortgage loan is held in connection with a GSE or Ginnie Mae guaranteed securitization transaction. The Bureau believes that it would not provide additional consumer protection to impose an obligation on a servicer to identify entities that may have an interest in a borrower's mortgage loan other than the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan, as such information would be of limited utility.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>During outreach, servicers generally did not express concerns to the Bureau regarding the obligation to provide borrowers with the type of information subject to the information request requirements. Specifically, in the Small Business Review Panel outreach, small entity representatives indicated that they felt fairly comfortable with the types of information that would be subject to the requirements, indicating that this information was generally in the borrower's mortgage loan file.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The small entity representatives did express concern regarding the obligation to provide information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. The small entity representatives stated that servicers may not have contact information for owners or assignees of mortgage loans, that such owners or assignees are not prepared to handle calls from borrowers, and that a typical servicer duty is to handle customer complaints so that owners or assignees of mortgage loans do not have to handle that responsibility. Certain owners, assignees, and guarantors of mortgage loans, including other federal agencies, have expressed similar concerns to the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters expressed similar concerns in response to the proposal. One industry trade association suggested that the Bureau amend proposed comment 36(a)-2 to require that servicers identify the name of the trustee rather than the name of the legal entity that holds the legal right to receive payments. The commenter argued that the information that the Bureau proposes servicers provide would not be meaningful to borrowers, as the trust itself cannot act. Moreover, the commenter asserted that servicers do not typically track the trust name with the account, as such information is rarely used. One large bank commenter urged the Bureau to amend the comment to replace the reference to “obligation” with “right” as the commenter asserted the former is not technically accurate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As outlined in the proposal, the Bureau understands the concerns asserted by servicers, owners, assignees, guarantors, and other federal agencies that requiring servicers to provide the proposed information to borrowers may confuse borrowers and lead to attempts to communicate with owners or assignees that are unprepared or unwilling to engage in such communications. The requirement that servicers identify to the borrower the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan was added as section 6(k)(1)(D) of RESPA by the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 6(k)(1)(D) requires that information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan must be provided to borrowers. The Bureau believes that the benefit to borrowers of obtaining the information, which was required by Congress, justifies any concerns about the potential for confusion. As to commenters' concern that trustee information is more relevant than trust information, the Bureau notes that proposed comment 36(a)-2 provided that where a trust is the owner or assignee of a loan, a servicer must provide the name of both the trustee and the trust. Also, for clarification purposes, the Bureau is revising proposed comment 36(a)-2 to state that when a borrower requests information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, a servicer complies by identifying the person on whose behalf the servicer receives payments from the borrower. Otherwise, the Bureau is adopting comment 36(a)-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(b) Contact Information for Borrowers To Request Information</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(b), which would have permitted a servicer to establish an exclusive telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information in accordance with the procedures in § 1024.36. If a servicer chose to establish a separate telephone number and address for information requests, the proposal would have required the servicer to provide the borrower a notice that states that the borrower may request information using the telephone number and address established by the servicer for that purpose. Proposed comment 36(b)-1 would have clarified that if a servicer has not designated a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information, then the servicer will be required to respond to an information request received at any office of the servicer. Proposed comment 36(b)-2 would have further clarified that the written notice to the borrower may be set forth in another written notice provided to the borrower, such as a notice of transfer, periodic statement, or coupon book. Proposed comment 36(b)-2 would have further clarified that if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address for receipt of information requests, the servicer must provide that telephone number and address in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to allow servicers to establish a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information in order to allow servicers to direct oral and written requests to appropriate personnel that have been trained to ensure that the servicer responds appropriately. As the proposal noted, at larger servicers with other consumer financial service affiliates, many personnel simply do not typically deal with mortgage servicing-related issues. For instance, at a major bank servicer, a borrower might request information from a local bank branch staff, who likely would not have access to the information necessary to respond to the request. Thus, the Bureau reasoned, if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address that a borrower must use, a servicer would not be required to comply with the information request requirements set forth in § 1024.36 for requests that may be received by the servicer through a different method.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters favored allowing servicers to designate an address and telephone number to which borrowers must direct information requests. At the same time, such commenters asserted that the proposal constituted an insufficient remedy to the burdens inherent in permitting oral information requests. Some commenters said that designating telephone lines for information requests could be especially costly for small servicers. Thus, one community bank trade association argued that the proposal favored large institutions. Two industry commenters requested clarification regarding how servicers must handle information requests sent to the wrong address. Finally, one credit union commenter asserted that servicers should only be required to include designated telephone numbers and addresses in regular forms of communication to borrowers, such as the periodic statement. In contrast, consumer group commenters suggested that to the extent a servicer designates a telephone line or address, the servicer should be required to post such information on its Web site and to include it in mailed notices.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Because the final rule removes the requirement that servicers comply with information request requirements under § 1024.36 for oral information requests, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to regulate the circumstances under which servicers may direct oral information requests to an exclusive telephone number that a borrower must use to request information. However, for written information requests, the Bureau continues to believe that it is reasonable to permit servicers to designate a specific address for the intake of information requests. Allowing a servicer to designate a specific address is consistent with current requirements of Regulation X with respect to qualified written requests. Current § 1024.21(e)(1) permits a servicer to designate a “separate and exclusive office and address for the receipt and handling of qualified written requests.” Moreover, the Bureau believes that identifying a specific address for receiving information requests will benefit consumers. By providing a specific address, servicers will identify to consumers the office capable of addressing requests made by consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is critical for servicers to publicize any designated address to ensure that borrowers know how properly to request information and to avoid evasion by servicers of information request procedures. This is especially important because, as noted in the proposal, servicers who designate a specific address for receipt of information requests are not required to comply with information request procedures for notices sent to the wrong address. Accordingly, final § 1024.36(b) requires servicers that designate addresses for receipt of requests for information to post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the servicer lists any contact address for the servicer. In addition, final comment 36(b)-2 retains the clarification that servicers that establish an address that a borrower must use to request information, must provide the address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance. The Bureau is otherwise adopting § 1024.36(b) and comments 36(b)-1 and 36(b)-2 as proposed, except that it has revised the provisions permitting servicers to designate a telephone number that a borrower must use to request information and clarified that the notice must be written.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.36(b), similar to proposed § 1024.35(c) for notices of error, would have required a servicer to use the same telephone number and address it designates for receiving notices of error for receiving information requests pursuant to proposed § 1024.36(b), and vice versa. Further, proposed comment 36(b)-3 would have clarified that any telephone numbers or addresses designated by a servicer for any borrower may be used by any other borrower to submit an information request. This clarifies that a servicer may not determine that an information request is invalid if it was received at any telephone number or address designated by the servicer for receipt of information requests just because it was not received by the specific phone number or address identified to a specific borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One non-bank servicer expressed concern about the proposal's requirement to designate the same address and telephone number for notices of error and information requests. The commenter explained that it assigns separate teams to address information requests and error notices. Thus, the commenter asserted, proposed § 1024.36(b) would negatively impact customer service. Having considered this comment, the Bureau notes that it proposed § 1024.36(b) because it was concerned that designating separate telephone numbers and addresses for notices of error and information requests could impede borrower attempts to submit notices of error and information requests to servicers due to debates over whether a particular communication constituted a notice of error or an information request. For the reasons set forth above and in the proposal, final § 1024.36(b) retains the requirement that servicers designate the same address for receipt of information requests and notices of error. In addition, the Bureau is adopting comment 36(b)-3 substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has removed references to information requests received by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(b)-5 would have further clarified that a servicer may use automated systems, such as an interactive voice response system, to manage the intake of borrower calls. The proposal provided that prompts for requesting information must be clear and provide the borrower the option to connect to a live representative. Because the final rule does not require servicers to comply with information request procedures for oral requests, the Bureau is withdrawing proposed comment 36(b)-5 from the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 36(b)-4 to clarify that a servicer would not be required to establish a process for receiving information requests through email, Web site form, or other online methods. Proposed comment 36(b)-4 was intended to further clarify that if a servicer establishes a process for receiving information requests through online methods, the servicer can designate it as the only online intake process that a borrower can use to request information. A servicer would not be required to provide a written notice to a borrower in order to gain the benefit of the online process being considered the exclusive online process for receiving information requests. Proposed comment 36(b)-4 would have further clarified that a servicer's decision to accept requests for information through an online intake method shall be in addition to, not in place of, any processes for receiving information requests by phone or mail.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter advocated requiring servicers to establish an online process for receipt of information requests. The Bureau agrees that online processes have significant promise to facilitate faster, cheaper communications between borrowers and servicers. However, the Bureau believes that this suggestion raises a broader issue around the use of electronic media for communications between servicers (and other financial services providers) and borrowers (and other consumers). The Bureau believes it would be most effective to address this issue in that larger context after study and outreach to enable the Bureau to develop principles or standards that would be appropriate on an industry-wide basis. The Bureau is therefore, at this time, finalizing language to permit, but not require, servicers to elect whether to adopt such a process. The Bureau intends to conduct broader analyses of electronic communications' potential for disclosure, error resolution, and information requests after the rule is released. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 36(b)-4 as proposed, with minor technical amendments, and having removed references to information requests received by telephone.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, including multiple credit union trade associations, requested that the Bureau lengthen the acknowledgment time period, asserting that five days was unreasonable, especially for smaller institutions. A nonprofit mortgage servicer said the timeframe was insufficient for its small volunteer staff. An industry trade association commenter argued that the acknowledgment requirement creates unnecessary paperwork and should be removed from the final rule altogether. In contrast, consumer group commenters were generally supportive of the acknowledgment requirement, noting that the timeline in the proposal was consistent with that in the Dodd-Frank Act for qualified written requests.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes acknowledgment within five days is appropriate given that the Dodd-Frank Act expressly adopts that requirement for qualified written requests and differentiating between two regimes would increase operational complexity. Moreover, the burden on servicers is significantly mitigated by the fact that the information request procedures are only applicable to written requests. The Bureau further notes that the contents of the acknowledgment are minimal. Moreover, servicers need not provide an acknowledgment if the servicer provides the information requested within five days. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(c) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>36(d)(1) Investigation and Response Requirements</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.36(d)(1) would have required a servicer to respond to an information request within 30 days by either (i) providing the borrower with the requested information and contact information for further assistance, or (ii) conducting a reasonable search for the requested information and providing the borrower with a written notification that states that the servicer has determined that the requested information is not available or cannot reasonably be obtained by the servicer, as appropriate, the basis for the servicer's determination, and contact information for further assistance. The proposal would have only required a servicer to provide a written notice to the borrower in response to the information request if the information requested by the borrower is not available or cannot reasonably be obtained by the servicer. The proposal would have permitted a servicer to respond either orally or in writing to the borrower if the servicer is providing the information requested by the borrower. The Bureau proposed to allow servicers to respond orally because it believed that the goal of providing information to borrowers would be furthered by allowing servicers to respond orally. Additionally, the Bureau believed that allowing the servicer to respond orally would reduce the burden on servicers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One consumer advocacy group commenter urged the Bureau to require that servicers respond to information requests in writing. The commenter argued that servicers regularly provide borrowers inconsistent and inaccurate information, which necessitates a written response. Because, as discussed above, the final rule requires borrowers to submit information requests in writing in order to gain the benefit of the information request procedures set forth in § 1024.36, the Bureau now believes it is appropriate and effectuates the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to require that servicers respond to borrowers' information requests in writing. Doing so will help ensure that there is a written record of both the borrower's request and the servicer's response, which the Bureau believes will reduce confusion regarding the accuracy of the information provided. For these reasons, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(d)(1) substantially as proposed, except that it has removed references to a servicer's oral response and clarified that the servicer's contact information must include a telephone number.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(d)(1)(ii)-1 would have clarified that information should not be considered as available to a servicer if the information is not in the servicer's possession or control or the servicer cannot retrieve the information in the ordinary course of business through reasonable efforts.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The purpose of the information request requirements is to provide an efficient means for borrowers to obtain information regarding their mortgage loan accounts and the Bureau believes that imposing obligations on servicers to provide information in response to an information request is an efficient means of achieving the goal of providing a borrower with access to requested information. However, the Bureau proposed comment 36(d)(1)(ii)-1 because it believes that burden for information requests will increase greatly if a servicer is required to undertake an investigation for documents that are not in a servicer's possession or control. The same inefficiency exists even if information is in a servicer's possession or control but, for appropriate business reasons, is stored in a medium that is not accessible by a servicer in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau believes that the marginal benefit of having additional information available to borrowers is not justified by the significant burdens that such investigations may incur. Moreover, the Bureau believes that it would frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to require that servicers devote considerable resources, which could otherwise be spent on responding to information requests that would benefit borrowers, to locating inaccessible information.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One mortgage servicer commented on proposed comment 36(d)(1)(ii)-1. The commenter requested that the Bureau provide examples in the commentary of what it considers to be unavailable information. Proposed comment 36(d)(1)(ii)-2 provides examples of when documents should and should not be considered to be available to a servicer in response to an information request, and such examples are reflected in the final comment as well. For the reasons discussed in the proposal and above, the Bureau is adopting comments 36(d)(1)(ii)-1 and 36(d)(1)(ii)-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6(e)(2) of RESPA to require a servicer to investigate and respond to a qualified written request within 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays). Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, servicers had 60 days to investigate and respond to a borrower's qualified written request. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i) to implement section 6(e)(2) of RESPA with respect to qualified written requests, and to impose the same timeframe on other requests for information from borrowers. Specifically, proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i) would have required a servicer to respond to an information request not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the information request, with one exception discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>While several industry commenters asserted that 30 days was insufficient, one credit union opined that the timeline was reasonable. Similarly, a consumer group commenter noted that the timeline was consistent with the time period for qualified written requests required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room asserted that the timeline was too generous. The Bureau believes that the 30-day timeframe proposed is appropriate given that the Dodd-Frank Act expressly changed the timeframe for qualified written requests from 60 days to 30 days and differentiating between two regimes would increase operational complexity as well as burden on borrowers and servicers. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting the 30-day timeline as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                    <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(D) to RESPA, which sets forth a ten business day limitation on a servicer to respond to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A) to implement this provision of RESPA. Proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A) would have provided that if a borrower submits a request for information regarding the identity of, and address or relevant contact information for, the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, a servicer shall respond to the information request with ten days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays). Proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A) would have required a servicer to provide the requested information within ten days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) instead of “10 business days,” as the Bureau interprets the “10 business day” requirement in section 6(k)(1)(D) of RESPA to mean ten calendar days with an exclusion for intervening legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and proposes to implement that interpretation in proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Two non-bank servicers commented that ten days is insufficient for those circumstances in which a servicer needs to obtain documentation confirming ownership, such as information contained in the collateral file. The Bureau acknowledges the concerns expressed but, as discussed in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that the burden of obtaining this information for any borrower will be significant enough to justify additional time beyond the ten days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) established by Congress for responding to borrower requests for information regarding the owner or assignee of the loan. Servicers generally have access to the identification of investors as that information is necessary to determine where to direct mortgage loan payments and reports with respect to the performance of serviced assets. The benefit to the borrower of obtaining the information, which Congress required, justifies the costs to servicers of complying within ten days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(A) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>Extensions of Time Limits</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(c)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6(e) of RESPA to permit servicers to extend the time for responding to a qualified written request by 15 days if, before the end of the 30-day period, the servicer notifies the borrower of the reasons for the extension. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(ii) to implement this provision with respect to qualified written requests, and to impose the same timeframe with respect to other requests for information. Proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(ii) would have permitted a servicer to extend the time period for responding to an information request by 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) if, before the end of the 30-day period set forth in proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(i)(B), the servicer notifies the borrower of the extension and the reasons for the delay in responding. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau did not propose to apply the extension allowance of proposed § 1024.36(d)(2)(ii) to information requests with respect to the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Permitting a 15-day extension of that timeframe would negate the shortened response period and undermine the purpose served by shortening it. While some consumer groups disfavored the extension, for the reasons discussed above and in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(d)(2)(ii) as proposed with minor technical amendments.</analysisParagraph>

This provision was consistent with section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA, which requires servicers to provide written acknowledgment of a qualified written request within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) “unless the action requested is taken within such period.” Proposed § 1024.36(e) would have permitted a servicer to provide the information requested either orally or in writing.

Proposed comment 36(f)(1)(i)-1 would have clarified that a borrower's request for a type of information that can change over time should not be considered substantially the same as a previous request for the same type of information. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(i) to ensure that a servicer is not required to expend resources conducting duplicative searches for documents, as such a requirement could divert resources from responding to other requests.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One anonymous commenter urged the Bureau to withdraw proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(i), claiming that the Bureau lacked authority to narrow the requirements listed in RESPA.

In addition, the Bureau believes that it would frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to require that servicers devote resources, which could otherwise be spent on responding to information requests that would benefit consumers, to respond to duplicative information requests. The Bureau therefore believes that § 1024.36(f)(1)(i) is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including of ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints and the provision and maintenance of accurate and relevant information.

The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(ii) because it believed that the purpose of providing borrowers with a means to request information regarding a borrower's mortgage loan account would be frustrated by permitting borrowers to request confidential, proprietary, or general corporation information of a servicer. Proposed comment 36(f)(1)(ii)-1 would have provided examples of confidential, proprietary, or general corporate information. These include information requests regarding: management and profitability of a servicer; other mortgage loans than the borrower's; investor reports; compensation, bonuses, and personnel actions for servicer personnel; the servicer's training programs; investor agreements; the evaluation or exercise of any owner or assignee remedy; the servicer's servicing program guide; investor instructions or requirements regarding loss mitigation options, examination reports, compliance audits or other investigative materials.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters expressed support for proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(ii), but urged the Bureau to make clear that servicers need not turn over privileged documents. Multiple industry commenters said that servicers should not be required to produce pooling and servicing agreements, as such agreements are confidential, proprietary and also costly to mail. In contrast, one consumer advocate commenter said that such agreements are not typically confidential or proprietary, yet important because servicers rely on such documents to make erroneous claims that they are not authorized to offer certain loan modifications. Consumer advocacy groups also asserted that proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(ii), as a whole, gives servicers too much discretion which may increase servicers' nonresponsiveness. An anonymous commenter said it was unclear which information falls into proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(ii) and also questioned the Bureau's authority to narrow the requirements of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(ii) to provide that servicers need not provide borrowers with information that is confidential, proprietary or privileged, as the Bureau believes that permitting information requests for such information could impede the ability of servicers to operate effectively. In addition, the Bureau believes that it would frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to require that servicers devote resources, which could otherwise be spent responding to information requests that would benefit consumers, to determining how to respond to information requests for confidential, proprietary, or privileged information that generally would not directly benefit the borrower, but might pose considerable disclosure risk to the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The final rule further removes the reference to general corporate information, and references to such information have been removed from the examples listed in final comment 36(f)(1)(ii)-1 as well. For example, because the Bureau does not believe that pooling and servicing agreements are typically kept confidential, final comment 36(f)(1)(ii)-1 no longer lists such agreements as examples. However, the Bureau notes that to the extent that a borrower requests such agreements, a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.36(c) or (d) if the servicer reasonably determines that any of the exclusions set forth in § 1024.36(f) apply.

The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(iii) because it believes the protection in it is appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the proposed rule, which is to provide a means for borrowers to obtain information from servicers regarding their own mortgage loan accounts.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A consumer group commenter argued that the proposal requires that borrowers state the information requested with too much specificity, arguing that a general request for information about the status of the borrower's loan should suffice. An anonymous commenter asserted that the Bureau proposes to improperly narrow the scope of information requests. The commenter reasoned that section 6(e)(1)(B) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to qualified written requests for information relating to the servicing of the loan. The commenter argued that the Bureau proposes to narrow that definition by adding the requirement that such requests must “directly” relate to the “mortgage loan account” for the loan.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>By relieving servicers of the duty to respond to requests for information that are not directly related to the borrower's mortgage loan account, the Bureau does not intend to impose an obligation on borrowers to identify with specificity the precise document or data point the borrower is seeking. Rather, the point of this section is to assure that servicers' resources are focused on securing relevant information for borrowers by excluding requests for information that are not relevant to the borrower's account. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau finds that § 1024.36(f)(1)(iii) is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA by ensuring that servicer resources that could be devoted to responding to information requests that benefit borrowers are not diverted to responding to information requests that would not result in consumer benefit. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the proposal and above, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(f)(1)(iii) as proposed.

The proposed rule would have defined “overbroad” and “unduly burdensome” for this purpose. It would have provided that an information request is overbroad if a borrower requests a servicer provide an unreasonable volume of documents or information to a borrower. The proposed rule stated that an information request is unduly burdensome if a diligent servicer could not respond to the request without either exceeding the maximum timeframe permitted by § 1024.36(d)(2)(ii) or incurring costs (or dedicating resources) that would be unreasonable in light of the circumstances. The proposed rule would have further clarified that if a servicer can identify a valid information request in a submission that is otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome, the servicer is required to respond to the information request that it can identify. Finally, the Bureau proposed comment 36(f)(1)(iv)-1 to set forth characteristics that may indicate if an information request is overbroad or unduly burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed above for proposed § 1024.35(g)(1)(ii), during pre-proposal outreach, consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and servicing industry representatives indicated to the Bureau that consumers do not typically use the current qualified written request process to request information. During the Small Business Review Panel outreach, small entity representatives expressed that typically qualified written requests received from borrowers were vague forms found online or forms used by advocates as a form of pre-litigation discovery. Servicers and servicing industry representatives indicated that these types of qualified written requests are unreasonable and unduly burdensome. Small entity representatives in the Small Business Review Panel outreach requested that the Bureau consider an exclusion for abusive requests, or requests made with the intent to harass the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment regarding whether a servicer should not be required to undertake the information request requirements in proposed § 1024.36(c) and (d) for information requests that are overbroad or unduly burdensome. Industry commenters supported the exclusion, but urged the Bureau to remove the requirement that servicers identify valid information requests in submissions that are otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome. Industry commenters said servicers should not be required to parse through such submissions to locate a clear information request. One large trade association of mortgage servicers said that the requirement effectively subsumes the exclusion. Consumer group commenters generally disfavored the exclusion. One commenter questioned the assertion that borrowers primarily use qualified written requests to obtain prelitigation discovery. One consumer group said the exclusion gives servicers too much discretion. Another said it requires borrowers to state their information requests with too much specificity. An anonymous consumer advocate said a request from a single borrower should not be so voluminous as to be burdensome for servicers to respond. Another consumer group commenter requested that the Bureau address situations in which the servicer erroneously determines that a submission is overbroad or unduly burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(f)(1)(iv), in part, because the Bureau believes that requiring servicers to respond to overbroad or unduly burdensome information requests from some borrowers may cause servicers to expend fewer resources to address requests that may be more clearly stated and more clearly require servicer attention. The Bureau was especially concerned about this in light of the proposed rule's requirement that servicers respond to an expanded universe of information requests, including requests for information that do not specifically relate to “servicing” as defined in RESPA, as implemented by this rule, as well as information requests asserted orally. While the final rule does not require that servicers undertake the information request procedures in § 1024.36(c) and (d) for oral submissions, it does not limit information requests to those related to servicing. Thus, the Bureau continues to believe that a requirement for servicers to respond to information requests that are overbroad or unduly burdensome may harm consumers and frustrate servicers' ability to comply with the new information request requirements. Finally, as stated in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that the information request procedures should replace or supplant civil litigation document requests and should not be used as a forum for pre-litigation discovery. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(f)(1)(iv) and comment 36(f)(1)(iv)-1 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

The servicer must send the notice not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after its determination and the notice must set forth the basis upon which the servicer has made the determination, noting the applicable provision of proposed § 1024.36(f)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One credit union trade association disfavored the proposed requirement that a servicer send a notice informing the borrower that an information request falls into one of the enumerated exclusions.

                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(f)(2) because it believes that borrowers should be notified that a servicer does not intend to take any action on the information request. The Bureau also believes borrowers should know the basis for the servicer's determination. By providing borrowers with notice of the basis for the servicer's determination, a borrower will know the servicer's basis and will have the opportunity to bring a legal action to challenge that determination where appropriate. Accordingly, having considered the comment, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(f)(2) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(g) Payment Requirement Limitations</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.36(g)(1) would have prohibited a servicer from charging a fee, or requiring a borrower to make any payment that may be owed on a borrower's account as a condition of responding to an information request. Proposed § 1024.36(g)(2) would have, however, permitted fees for providing payoff statements or beneficiary notices under applicable law. The Bureau proposed § 1024.36(g)(1) and (2) for three reasons. First, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(B) to RESPA, which prohibits a servicer from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests. Proposed § 1024.36(g) would have implemented that provision with respect to qualified written requests for information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan. Second, the Bureau believes that a servicer practice of charging for responding to an information request impedes borrowers from pursuing valid information requests, and that the prohibition is therefore necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints. Third, the Bureau learned from outreach with consumer advocates that, in some instances, servicers have demanded that borrowers make payments before the servicer will provide a borrower with information requested by the borrower or will correct errors identified by a borrower. The Bureau believes that a servicer is required to provide a borrower with information about the borrower's mortgage loan account notwithstanding the payment status of a borrower's account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some consumer advocacy group commenters expressed support for the fee prohibition, stating that the prohibition is statutorily required. In contrast, a large credit union trade association opposed the prohibition, noting that it bars fees for items for which credit unions routinely charge, such as fees for copies of cancelled checks and periodic statements. The trade association argued that the proposed rule should take the fact that a fee is legally permissible into account. A law firm that represents servicers argued that it would be unfair and economically burdensome to prohibit servicers from charging fees for duplicate statements, such as year-end statements and tax forms.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Having considered these comments, for the reasons stated above and in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.36(g) as proposed, except that § 1024.36(g)(2) no longer references payoff statements. The Bureau has removed the reference to payoff statements, as the final rule excludes such statements from information request requirements under § 1024.36 altogether.</analysisParagraph>

The proposed requirement is consistent with section 6(e)(3) of RESPA which prohibits servicers from furnishing adverse information only as to qualified written requests that assert an error with respect to the borrower's payments, but not to a qualified written request that requests information. Moreover, the Bureau does not believe that the consumer protection purposes of RESPA would be furthered by permitting borrowers to evade consumer reporting by submitting an information request.

            <analysisParagraph>Section 6(e) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to “qualified written requests” that relate to the servicing of a loan. Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add section 6(k)(1)(B), which prohibits servicers from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests (as defined in regulations to be issued by the Bureau). In addition, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add section 6(k)(1)(D), which states that a servicer shall not fail to provide information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan within ten business days of a borrower's request.</analysisParagraph>

In addition, as discussed above with respect to § 1024.35, the Bureau believed that it served the interests of borrowers and servicers alike to establish a uniform regulatory regime, parallel to that applicable to notices of error under § 1024.35, applicable to borrower requests for information relating to their mortgage loan irrespective of whether such requests were made in the form of a qualified written request. In the Bureau's view, such requirements are necessary to ensure that servicers respond to borrowers' requests and complaints and timely provide borrowers with relevant and accurate information about their mortgage loans.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>37(a)(1) In General</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As added by the Dodd-Frank Act, section 6(k)(2) of RESPA states that for purposes of section 6(k) through (m) of RESPA, force-placed insurance means hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage. The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(a)(1) to implement section 6(k)(2) of RESPA. The proposed provision stated that in general, for purposes of § 1024.37, the term “force-placed insurance” means hazard insurance obtained by a servicer on behalf of the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan on a property securing such loan.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.37(a)(1) did not incorporate language from the statute referring to a borrower's failure to maintain or renew hazard insurance as required under the terms of the mortgage. As explained in the proposal, the Bureau was concerned that adopting that language might raise questions whether the Dodd-Frank Act protections applied to situations in which a borrower did, in fact, have hazard insurance in place but the borrower's servicer obtained force-placed insurance anyway. The Bureau noted that borrowers in such a situation are most in need of protection from unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance. Indeed, in other respects, the force-placed insurance provisions added to RESPA by the Dodd-Frank Act expressly contemplate that the protections apply in circumstances where a borrower, in fact, has hazard insurance in place. For example, the notice to the borrower required under RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A) is required to include a statement of the procedures by which the borrower may demonstrate insurance coverage, and under RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3), which provides that upon receipt by a servicer of confirmation that a borrower has hazard insurance in place, a servicer must terminate force-placed insurance and refund to the borrower all force-placed premiums and related charges for periods of overlapping coverage. Thus, notwithstanding the phrase “when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance,” the Bureau interprets the definition of force-placed insurance to include situations in which a servicer obtains hazard insurance coverage on a property where the borrower has in fact maintained the borrower's own hazard insurance. The Bureau also proposed to add language to the definition of the term “force-placed insurance” in proposed § 1024.37(a)(i) to describe the insurance as being obtained by a servicer “on behalf of the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan on a property securing such loan.” This language was intended to distinguish force-placed insurance from situations in which a servicer renews borrowers' own hazard insurance policies as described in § 1024.17 or otherwise. The Bureau observes that a servicer is simply renewing a borrower's own hazard insurance under these circumstances and does not interpret such insurance as hazard insurance “obtained” by a servicer within the statutory definition of “force-placed insurance” set forth in section 6(k)(2) of RESPA. The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed definition of the term “force-placed insurance” set forth in proposed § 1024.37(a)(1). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(a)(1) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.37(a)(2)(i) would have provided that hazard insurance to protect against flood loss obtained by a servicer as required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 is not force-placed insurance for the purposes of § 1024.37. The Bureau proposed to exclude flood insurance that is required under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) from the definition of the term “force-placed insurance,” because, as discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of the defined term “Hazard insurance,” the Bureau believed and continues to believe that the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations should not apply to servicers when they are required by the FDPA to purchase flood insurance. As discussed above, the FDPA provides an extensive set of restrictions on a servicers' purchase of flood insurance required by the FDPA, and the Bureau was concerned that subjecting servicers to overlapping regulatory restrictions would be unduly burdensome and might result in consumer confusion.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should only exempt servicers from the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations to the extent they purchase force-placed flood policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) because the FDPA can reasonably be interpreted to require servicers to purchase force-placed flood insurance through the NFIP. The consumer groups further asserted that it was important to ensure that RESPA's consumer protections with respect to force-placed insurance apply when servicers force-place private flood insurance because private force-placed insurance policies are more expensive than the NFIP flood policies. As discussed above, industry commenters generally said that the proposed exclusion of hazard insurance to protect against flood loss obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of the term “force-placed insurance” was workable and adequately mitigated the risk of a servicer having to comply with both regulations under the FDPA and the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has carefully considered these comments and is adopting proposed § 1024.37(a)(2)(i) as proposed. The Bureau does not administer the FDPA, and accordingly declines to opine on whether the FDPA requires servicers to purchase flood insurance policies from the NFIP. The Bureau, however, observes that there is existing guidance from Federal agencies that administer the FPDA that suggests that a servicer may reasonably interpret the FDPA to permit servicers to satisfy their obligations under the statute through the purchase of private flood insurance.<footnote ref="109">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance, 74 FR 35914, 35944 (July 21, 2009) (question 63 &amp;amp; 64 provide guidance on the circumstances under which lenders could rely on private flood insurance policies to meet their obligations to maintain adequate flood insurance coverage); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also,&lt;/em&gt; Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Mandatory Purchase of Flood Insurance Guidelines&lt;/em&gt; 42 (September 2007)(stating that a lender has the option of force placing flood insurance through a private (non-NFIP) insurer).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the consumer groups did not suggest that the consumer protections in the FDPA do not apply to a servicer's purchase of private flood insurance, and the Bureau has no reason to believe that they do not. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that if the Bureau were to adopt the consumer groups' suggestion to exclude from the definition of the term “force-placed insurance” only policies purchased under the NFIP, a servicer who purchased private flood insurance to comply with its obligations under the FDPA would have to comply with both the Bureau's regulations and regulations under the FDPA. As discussed above, this result would impose unnecessary compliance burdens and frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions. For the reasons discussed above, § 1024.37(a)(2)(i) is necessary and appropriate to avoid undermining the consumer protection purposes of RESPA's force-placed provisions and is thus authorized under sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA states that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan shall not obtain force-placed insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance. The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(b) to implement section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA. Proposed § 1024.37(b) stated that a servicer may not obtain force-placed insurance unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the mortgage loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed related commentary to provide illustrative examples of “a reasonable basis to believe” that a borrower has failed to maintain hazard insurance. Proposed comment 37(b)-1 would have provided two examples in the context of a borrower with an escrow account established to pay for hazard insurance premiums. Proposed comment 37(b)-2 would have provided an example of a borrower who has not established an escrow account to pay for hazard insurance premiums. During pre-proposal outreach, servicers and force-placed insurance providers told the Bureau that their process of verifying the existence of insurance coverage before obtaining force-placed insurance for borrowers with escrow and borrowers without escrow was different. Accordingly, the Bureau believed that it was appropriate to provide different examples based on whether the borrower had escrowed for hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups and a number of industry commenters suggested that the Bureau make changes to proposed § 1024.37(b). Consumer group commenters expressed the concern that proposed § 1024.37(b) would be too weak to motivate servicers to change their practices with respect to the purchase of force-placed insurance. Several consumer groups recommended that that the Bureau replace the proposed commentary to 1024.37(b) with a collective standard that would determine whether the servicer had a reasonable basis for obtaining force-placed insurance based on whether the percentage of cases in which borrowers receive a full refund for force-placed insurance charges exceed five percent per calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast, a number of industry commenters suggested that proposed § 1024.37(b) was too limiting and might unduly chill servicer's use of force-placed insurance to protect a lender's collateral. A number of industry commenters requested that the Bureau change proposed § 1024.37(b) so that the reasonable basis standard in § 1024.37(b) would be defined solely by compliance with the procedural requirements enumerated in section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) of RESPA and § 1024.37(c) and (d)<footnote ref="110">Section 6(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) provides that a servicer of a federally related mortgage shall not be construed as having a reasonable basis for obtaining force-placed insurance unless the requirements of section 6(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) of RESPA have been met.</footnote>
            
            or, in the alternative, would provide a safe harbor for servicers that meet such requirements. One large force-placed insurance provider and one large bank servicer said that if the Bureau did not change proposed § 1024.37(b), then the Bureau should expressly state in commentary to § 1024.37(b) that the examples are illustrative and do not provide the only situations in which a servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower's hazard insurance has lapsed. One national trade association representing federal credit unions suggested that the Bureau provide a safe harbor for servicers acting in good faith when they obtained force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After careful review of these comments and further consideration, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(b) with changes. First, the Bureau has concluded that when a servicer purchases force-placed insurance but does not charge a borrower for such insurance, the servicer does not “obtain” force-placed insurance within the meaning of section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA. The Bureau arrived at this conclusion after re-evaluating the connection between section 6(k)(1)(A) and (<em data-original="E-03">l</em>). As described above, section 6(k)(1)(A) establishes that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan shall not obtain force-placed insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance. Section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) establishes that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan shall not be construed as having a reasonable basis for obtaining force-placed insurance unless the requirements of section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) have been met. But one of the requirements is that a servicer must terminate force-placed insurance within 15 days of the servicer receiving confirmation of a borrower's existing insurance coverage. The Bureau believes that this provision expressly contemplates that a servicer may purchase force-placed insurance before meeting the requirements of section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>). Accordingly, where “obtaining” is used in section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>), the Bureau interprets the statute to mean “charging.” Because “obtain” appears in section 6(k)(1)(A) and 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>), the Bureau has changed § 1024.37(b) to reflect more clearly the statutory prohibition against “charging.” Accordingly, as finalized, § 1024.37(b) provides that a servicer may not assess on a borrower a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the mortgage loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also changed commentary intended to explain the circumstances that provide a servicer with a “reasonable basis to believe” for purposes of § 1024.37(b). The Bureau has decided not to provide specific examples of “a reasonable basis to believe.” Instead, as adopted, comment 37(b)-1 provides that information about a borrower's hazard insurance received by a servicer from a borrower, the borrower's insurance provider or insurance agent, may provide a servicer with a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. The Bureau believed that sometimes the absence of information may provide a servicer with a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. Accordingly, proposed comment 37(b)-1 would have clarified that a servicer had a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower with an escrow account established for hazard insurance has failed to maintain hazard insurance if the servicer had not received a renewal bill within a reasonable time prior to the expiration date of the borrower's hazard insurance. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that the comment may convey that the absence of information would provide a servicer with a safe harbor. The Bureau believes that a safe harbor based on the absence of information would not adequately ensure that borrowers are protected from unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting commentary to provide that in the absence of receiving information about a borrower's hazard insurance, a servicer may satisfy the reasonable basis to believe standard if a servicer acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status, and does not receive, from the borrower or otherwise have evidence of insurance coverage as provided in § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has concluded that a servicer following the notification procedure established by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) of RESPA has acted with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status, but compliance with those procedural elements alone are not sufficient to provide a safe harbor. The statute prohibits a servicer from imposing any charge on a borrower for force-placed insurance if the servicer has received demonstration of hazard insurance coverage by the end of the notification process. Accordingly, comment 37(b)-1, as adopted, explains that an example of acting with reasonable diligence is one in which a servicer complies with the notification requirements set forth in § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) and (ii), and if after complying with such requirements, the servicer does not receive, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence of insurance coverage as provided in § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to provide a separate safe harbor for servicers acting in good faith because the Bureau believes the standard set forth in § 1024.37(b) provides sufficient flexibility for servicers to balance their obligations to owners and assignees of mortgage loans to ensure that a property is adequately insured and to protect borrowers from unwarranted and unnecessary charges and fees. The Bureau also declines to adopt a collective standard to evaluate whether a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance is proper. The Bureau believes that the percentage of cases in which a borrower receives a full refund for force-placed insurance charges may be relevant in assessing whether a servicer is maintaining reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that a servicer is maintaining accurate information about a borrower's mortgage loan. But the Bureau believes that section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA established a loan-level standard. Using a collective standard to evaluate whether a servicer has satisfied the reasonable basis to believe requirement in section 6(k)(1)(A) would not be appropriate because the standard would be overbroad and might discourage a servicer from obtaining force-placed insurance even though a servicer has actual information that a borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A state trade association representing banks and one of its member banks urged the Bureau to eliminate proposed § 1024.37(b). They expressed concern that the reasonable basis standard, in combination with the prohibition on charging a borrower for insurance in proposed § 1024.37(c)(1) for at least 45 days, would increase the likelihood that homes go uninsured for a significant period of time. The Bureau declines to eliminate § 1024.37(b) because the Bureau believes the provision is necessary to implement RESPA's force-placed provisions. In addition, the Bureau believes that the commenters' concern is unwarranted, in particular, because § 1024.37(b) has been revised to reframe the prohibition as one on charging the borrower for, rather than purchasing, force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Lastly, a state trade association representing banks and thrifts expressed concern that servicers may rely on information from an insurance provider that later turns out to be incorrect about the status of a borrower's hazard insurance coverage to purchase force-placed insurance. For example, the commenter said that insurance providers may send notices of cancellation to servicers before a borrower's insurance actually lapses. The Bureau recognizes that servicers may sometimes wrongly conclude that there is a reasonable basis to charge borrowers for force-placed insurance, even after complying with the procedures steps in § 1024.37(c)(1). But whether § 1024.37(b) is violated turns on whether or not a servicer had a reasonable basis to reach its conclusion based on the information the servicer has at the time the servicer charges a borrower for force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>37(c)(1) In General</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) of RESPA, added by section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, states that a servicer may not impose any charge on a borrower for force-placed insurance with respect to any property securing a federally related mortgage unless the servicer (1) sends a written notice by first-class mail to a borrower that contains disclosures about a borrower's obligation to maintain hazard insurance, a servicer's lack of evidence that a borrower has such insurance, a clear and conspicuous statement of how the borrower may demonstrate coverage, and a statement that a servicer may obtain insurance coverage at a borrower's expense if the borrower does not provide demonstration of coverage in a timely manner (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> section 6(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)(1)(A)(i) through (iv)); (2) sends a second written notice by first-class mail containing the same disclosures to a borrower at least 30 days after mailing the first written notice (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(B)); and (3) does not receive any demonstration of hazard insurance coverage by the end of the 15-day period beginning on the date the second written notice was sent to the borrower (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(C)).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(c)(1) to implement section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1). Proposed § 1024.37(c)(1) would have provided that a servicer may not charge a borrower for force-placed insurance unless: (1) A servicer delivers to the borrower or places in the mail a written notice with the disclosures set forth in § 1024.37(c)(2) at least 45 days before the premium charge or any fee is assessed; (2) it delivers to such borrower or places in the mail a written notice in accordance with § 1024.37(d)(1), which would have prohibited a servicer from delivering or placing in the mail this second notice until 30 days have passed after the servicer has delivered or placed in the mail the first written notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i); and (3) during the 45-day notice period, the servicer has not received verification that such borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously. Proposed § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) also stated that determining whether the borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously, the servicer shall take account of any grace period provided under State or other applicable law. The Bureau proposed to permit a servicer to choose between delivering the written notice to the borrower or mailing the written notices established by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A) and (B) of RESPA because the Bureau believed it was necessary and proper to achieve the purposes of RESPA to provide servicers with flexibility to either deliver or mail the required notices, since delivery will often be faster than transmittal by mail.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 37(c)(1)-1 would have clarified the minimum length of the notice period. It stated that notice period set forth in § 1024.37(c)(1) begins on the day that the servicer delivers or mails the notice to the borrower and expires 45 days later, and that the servicer may assess the premium charge and any fees for force-placed insurance beginning on the 46th day if the servicer has fulfilled the requirements of § 1024.37(c) and (d). The comment further stated that if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, the servicer may retroactively charge a borrower for force-placed insurance obtained during the 45-day notice period. Proposed comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-1 would have provided examples of borrowers having hazard insurance in place continuously.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Two non-bank servicers stated that they supported proposed § 1024.37(c)(1) and related commentary. One of the commenters observed that the Bureau's proposal reflects its current practice. This is consistent with feedback from small servicers with whom the Small Business Review Panel conducted outreach in advance of the proposal. One participant stated that it currently provides two notices that are very similar to the ones that would be required, and another participant stated that it currently exceeds the number of notices that would be required.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments on various aspects of proposed § 1024.37(c)(1). Except as discussed below, the majority of industry commenters did not raise concerns with the notification aspect of proposed § 1024.37(c)(1). The majority of industry commenters only sought clarification. First, they requested the Bureau clarify that a servicer may retroactively charge a borrower for force-placed insurance back to the date that a borrower's hazard insurance lapsed, even if the servicer sends the first notice after the date of lapse. Second, a number of industry commenters requested that the Bureau clarify how a servicer should account for grace periods when determining whether a borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously. They observed that a grace period under a typical hazard insurance policy extends a policyholder's insurance coverage past the expiration date only if the policyholder pays the past-due premium during such period. A bank servicer requested the Bureau clarify that “grace period” used in proposed § 1024.37 refer to grace periods applicable to the borrower's hazard insurance, and not grace periods applicable to the borrower's loan during which the borrower pays the mortgage payment after the due date without incurring a late charge. One large bank servicer sought clarification of whether the notice period could exceed 45 days.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A minority of industry commenters opposed the notification aspect of proposed § 1024.37(c)(1). One credit union contended that the proposed notices would be duplicative, unnecessary, and add to the overall cost of lending because borrowers already receive multiple notices from their insurers prior to cancellation. A trade association representing retail banks asserted that if a borrower's hazard insurance coverage lapses before the second notice is provided, then a servicer should be able to obtain force-placed insurance without having to send the second notice. A bank servicer argued that rather than requiring a servicer to send a second notice at least 15 days prior to charging a borrower for force-placed insurance, the Bureau should instead permit a servicer to simply provide a notice within five days of purchasing force-placed insurance. One state credit union league expressed concern about the aggregate notice burden servicers would be required to bear if the mortgage servicing rules are finalized as proposed and suggested that the burden could be reduced if the Bureau combines the first and second written notice into a single notice. One credit union asserted that the Bureau should allow a servicer to include the proposed force-placed insurance notices with the periodic statement because multiple documents mailed to the borrower could decrease the probability of the borrower actually paying attention to the information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to reconsider the aspect of the proposal that would have required servicers to wait at least 45 days to charge a borrower for force-placed insurance. The commenters contended that servicers, especially small servicers, would incur significant costs because servicers would have to advance force-placed insurance charges for borrowers. One state credit union trade association urged the Bureau to exercise its exception authority to exempt small servicers from the requirements of § 1024.37(c). In addition to the cost of advancement, the commenter also asserted that it would be costly for small servicers to send the notices. One non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau shorten the notice period to 30 days, while a bank servicer urged the Bureau to shorten the notice period to 10 days. One bank servicer also requested the Bureau to preempt Texas law that addresses notification requirements that apply to creditors' purchase of force-placed insurance for residential mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One bank servicer commented that a rule requiring servicers to provide notices like the proposed periodic statement or force-placed insurance notices to borrowers would be a waste of servicer resources without a corresponding benefit to consumers in situations involving a borrower whom the servicer has referred to foreclosure, a borrower who has declared bankruptcy, or a borrower who has made no payment or contacted the servicer for more than six months and whom the servicer has determined to have vacated the property. It sought an exemption from compliance with any force-placed insurance notification requirements with regard to those three categories of borrowers. One national trade association representing credit unions and a credit union commenter expressed concern that credit union members may believe that they should only be charged from the date that they received the first notice. Lastly, some industry commenters stated that a servicer should not be subject to a waiting period of 45 days to obtain force-placed insurance because it leaves collateral exposed and increases the risk to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer advocacy group urged the Bureau to strengthen the notification requirement so that a servicer would be required to provide the first notice within 15 days of placing force-placed insurance. It further asserted that it would be unreasonable to permit a servicer to retroactively charge a borrower for more than 60 days of force-placed insurance because it is a servicer's responsibility to identify lapses in insurance and notify borrowers of such lapses in a timely fashion.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Lastly, several industry commenters requested the Bureau clarify what “verification” means because they were concerned that the proposal would have required servicers to accept any insurance information they received from borrowers. The commenters noted that the traditional means of establishing proof of insurance is by requiring a borrower to provide a copy of an insurance policy declaration page, a certificate of insurance, or the insurance policy. The commenters expressed concern that without any of these, servicers may might potentially not be able to provide mortgage investors with the proof such investors require as evidence of coverage.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of these comments and further consideration, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(c)(1) with several adjustments. With respect to the notification aspect of § 1024.37(c)(1), the Bureau notes that RESPA establishes a very detailed scheme for any servicer (without consideration of the servicer's size) to follow before a servicer imposes a charge on any borrower for force-placed insurance. The Bureau believes that the prescriptive nature of the statutory scheme suggests that Congress believed that each step was necessary to achieve the consumer protection purpose of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions. The notification procedures the Bureau proposed in § 1024.37(c)(1) mirror the prescriptive statutory scheme because they were necessary to achieve the intent of Congress. The Bureau declines to adopt suggestions received from commenters, which ranged from creating exemptions for small servicers and unresponsive borrowers to changing various aspects of the notification requirements, because they would make § 1024.37(c)(1) depart from the statutory scheme Congress established.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also worked to craft effective notices through consumer testing, and the results of those tests suggest that borrowers will in fact welcome and respond to the notices. The Bureau further believes that some of the commenters' concerns are addressed by the fact that the Bureau is interpreting the statutory language to allow charges to be assessed retroactively for any period in which coverage was not maintained continuously once the procedural and substantive statutory criteria are met. Moreover, the Bureau believes that it is unnecessary to set limitations on a servicer's right to assess on borrowers charges retroactively because the statute establishes that a borrower has an unconditional right to a full refund of force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees the borrower has paid for any period in which the borrower's hazard insurance and the force-placed insurance were both in place.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request for preemption, the Bureau observes that based on the way in which the commenter described Texas law, it does not appear that compliance with Texas law would prevent a servicer from complying with the Bureau's force-placed insurance notification requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau believes preemption is not appropriate based on the information provided.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making several changes to § 1024.37(c)(1) for clarification purposes. The Bureau is adopting new comment § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) to clarify that a servicer may charge a borrower for force-placed insurance a servicer purchased, retroactive to the first day of any period in which the borrower did not have hazard insurance in place. The Bureau is clarifying the role of a grace period under applicable law in determining whether a borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously in new comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-1. The Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) to clarify what “receiving verification” means by replacing the phrase “received verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously” in proposed § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) with the phrase “received, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had in place continuously hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has concluded that putting the responsibility entirely on a servicer to verify a borrower's hazard insurance coverage by requiring a servicer to accept any written information from a borrower as long as it contains the insurance policy number, and the name, mailing address and phone number of the borrower's insurance company or the borrower's insurance agency as evidence of insurance would impose too large of a burden on a servicer to determine whether the property is in fact insured in accordance with the terms and conditions of a borrower's loan contract. Accordingly, in new comment 1024.37(c)(1)(iii)-2, the Bureau is explaining that as evidence of continuous hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance, a servicer may require a copy of the borrower's hazard insurance policy declaration page, the borrower's insurance certificate, the borrower's insurance policy, or other similar forms of written confirmation because the Bureau interprets the statutory language “reasonable form of written confirmation of existing insurance coverage” in section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(2) of RESPA to mean documents servicers typically require borrowers to provide to establish proof of coverage. Further, comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-2 provides that a servicer may reject evidence of hazard insurance coverage submitted by the borrower if neither the borrower's insurance provider nor insurance agent provides confirmation of the insurance information submitted by the borrower, or if the terms and conditions of the borrower's hazard insurance policy do not comply with the borrower's loan contract requirements because the Bureau interprets section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3) of RESPA to permit a servicer to separately confirm insurance information that a borrower has proffered to establish proof of coverage and the statutory language in section 6(k)(1)(A) to permit a servicer to charge a borrower force-placed insurance when the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request to clarify that the 45-day notification period set forth in proposed § 1024.37(c)(1) establishes the minimum amount of time that must lapse between the time a servicer sends a borrower the first written notice required by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) and the time a servicer imposes a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance, the Bureau believes that the fact that the Bureau intended the 45 days to be the minimum amount of time was clear in the proposal and thus, does not believe additional clarification in the final rule is necessary.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>37(c)(2) Content of Notice</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.37(c)(1), section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A)(i) through (iv) of RESPA establishes the disclosures that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan must provide in the written notices it sends to borrowers. The Bureau proposed § 1027.37(c)(2) to implement section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A)(i) through (iv). Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2) would have required a servicer to set forth, in the notice that would have been required under proposed § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), certain information about force-placed insurance. Specifically, proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(i) through (iv) would have required a servicer to disclose the following information: (1) The date of the notice; (2) the servicer's name and mailing address; (3) the borrower's name and mailing address; and (4) a statement that requests the borrower to provide hazard insurance information for the borrower's property and identifies the property by its address. Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(v) would have required that a servicer provide a statement that the borrower's hazard insurance is expiring or expired, as applicable, and that the servicer does not have evidence that the borrower has hazard insurance coverage past the expiration date. For a borrower that has more than one type of hazard insurance on the property, the servicer must identify the type of hazard insurance for which the servicer lacks evidence of coverage. Proposed comment 37(c)(2)(v)-1 would have explained that if a borrower has purchased a homeowners' insurance policy and a separate hazard insurance policy to insure loss against hazards not covered under his or her homeowners' insurance policy, the servicer must disclose whether it is the borrower's homeowners' insurance policy or the separate hazard insurance policy for which it lacks evidence of coverage to comply with § 1024.37(c)(2)(v). Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(vi) would have required that a servicer provide a statement that hazard insurance is required on the borrower's property and that the servicer has obtained or will obtain, as applicable, insurance at the borrower's expense.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(vii) would have required that the initial notice to the borrower contain a statement requesting the borrower to promptly provide the servicer with the insurance policy number and the name, mailing address and phone number of the borrower's insurance company or the borrower's insurance agent. Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(viii) would have required the notice to contain a description of how the borrower may provide the information requested pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(2)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, § 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) and (x) would have required information regarding the relative costs and scope of coverage of force-placed insurance versus hazard insurance obtained by the borrower, specifically: (1) The cost of the force-placed insurance, stated as an annual premium, or as a good faith estimate if actual pricing is not available; and (2) a statement that insurance the servicer obtains may cost significantly more than hazard insurance obtained by the borrower and may not provide as much coverage as hazard insurance obtained by the borrower. Proposed § 1024.37(c)(2)(xi) would have required that a servicer provide the servicer's telephone number for borrower questions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The disclosures regarding the potential cost and scope of coverage for force-placed insurance were not specifically required under the Dodd-Frank Act, but the Bureau believed that it was appropriate to propose them pursuant to the Bureau's RESPA section 6(k)(1)(E) authority in order to provide borrowers with critical information about the benefits, costs, and risks of the insurance that would be imposed if they failed to act. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the Bureau tested the force-placed insurance disclosures established by the Dodd-Frank Act in three rounds of consumer testing. Participant response in consumer testing suggested that knowing about higher cost of force-placed insurance could motivate borrowers to act promptly and thus avoid being charged for force-placed insurance. All participants said upon receipt of the notice, they would immediately contact their insurance provider to find out whether or not their hazard insurance had expired or purchase new hazard insurance because they would not want to pay for the higher cost of force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment 37(c)(2)(ix)-1 to clarify that the good faith estimate of the cost of the force-placed insurance the servicer may obtain should be consistent with the best information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the disclosure is provided. The proposed comment stated that differences between the amount of the estimated cost disclosed under § 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) and the actual cost do not necessarily constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the estimated cost was based on the best information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the disclosure was provided. The Bureau believed that its proposed good faith standard would provide significant safeguards against the risk that some servicers might intentionally underestimate the cost of force-placed insurance while providing sufficient flexibility to account for the fact that costs may change due to legitimate reasons between the time the disclosure is made and the time the borrower is charged.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups applauded the content requirements the Bureau proposed, but with one caveat. They expressed concern that the proposed disclosure concerning the fact that force-placed insurance may not provide as much coverage as borrower-obtained hazard insurance was too generic, and thus would not provide information meaningful enough to alert the borrower to the risks of force-placed insurance and prompt the borrower to act. They suggested adding additional disclosures that force-placed insurance would not cover damage to the borrower's personal property, personal liability for injuries to others while they are on the borrower's property, or living expenses while the borrower's home is under repair. The Bureau has considered the consumer groups' concern but is reluctant to add further information without consumer testing in light of the risk that information overload could adversely impact the effectiveness of the notice. The Bureau also notes that results of the testing of the model forms suggest that the existing disclosures will prompt recipients of the force-placed insurance notices to act promptly. As summarized by Macro in its report on the consumer testing of mortgage servicing disclosures during the pre-proposal stage, all subjects who were shown samples of force-placed insurance notices said they would act immediately in response to receiving such notices, even though the samples did not contain detailed description of potential coverage differences.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One consumer group suggested that a statement informing a borrower of the availability of State-created hazard insurance programs should be a required disclosure because these programs are designed to make hazard insurance available to borrowers who have trouble qualifying for insurance from traditional sources. Again, the Bureau has considered the issue but is reluctant to add further information without consumer testing in light of the risks of information overload. The Bureau is also concerned that a completely generic notice that State programs “may” be available without contact information would not be very useful to consumers, and that tailoring the notices to particular States would be burdensome to servicers. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to implement the comment. The commenter also urged the Bureau to require servicers to include force-placed insurance charges in regular invoice statements that are sent to a borrower so that a borrower is constantly reminded of how much of the borrower's payments are going toward paying for such insurance. Another consumer group submitted similar comments recommending that the Bureau require servicers to identify force-placed insurance charges specifically in proposed periodic statements so that borrowers could easily recognize when force-placed insurance has been obtained. The Bureau notes that servicers will be required to list force-placed insurance charges like any other charge, in the periodic statement that the Bureau is finalizing in the 2012 TILA Servicing Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocates and some industry commenters praised the proposal to require actual cost information or estimated costs in the mandatory disclosures. A force-placed insurance commenter, for instance, stated that it currently provides its borrowers with such estimates and that it has proven successful in convincing borrowers of the benefit of obtaining their own coverage. Some industry commenters, however, opposed the proposed disclosure as unnecessary because the Bureau separately proposed to require servicers to inform borrowers that force-placed insurance may cost significantly more than borrower-obtained hazard insurance. One force-placed insurance provider further observed that the existing practice of most servicers is to provide a binder of the force-placed insurance coverage with the second notice to make borrowers aware of the cost of such insurance. These commenters and a large bank servicer further noted that the National Mortgage Settlement did not include a required disclosure about the cost of force-placed insurance and urged the Bureau to refrain from requiring more disclosures than required by the settlement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters also asserted that a servicer might not have enough information to provide an estimate of force-placed insurance costs because the first notice would be provided to a borrower at a point where a servicer might not have obtained the premium information. Estimates are also complicated by the fact that the cost of insurance is determined by factors not within the servicer's control (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> insurers' pricing formulas, the number of days a borrower is delinquent on the mortgage loan). Two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry asserted that if a servicer does not rely on a third party to track a borrower's hazard insurance, the servicer would not have the information necessary to make good faith estimates of insurance premiums until the force-placed insurance is actually issued. One of the commenters asserted that this problem is likely to be most acute for small servicers because they often do not hire third parties to track a borrower's hazard insurance. The two commenters also questioned whether a servicer could be held liable for differences between an estimate and the actual cost under a theory that the differences were caused by unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. They also questioned whether a servicer would have the authority to provide the estimate because for an estimate to be binding, an insurance binder from a licensed insurance agent or provider is required. The two commenters and a force-placed insurance provider also expressed concern that the potential inaccuracies with estimate costs may lead to customer confusion and complaints. Lastly, several industry commenters expressed concern with the use of the phrase “good faith estimate” because the phrase is a defined term in existing Regulation X with a different meaning than the meaning set forth in proposed comment 37(c)(2)(ix)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After considering these comments, the Bureau is withdrawing the requirement to provide the cost of force-placed insurance (or a good faith estimate of the cost) in the notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), but keeping the requirement for purposes of the reminder notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(ii). The Bureau believes that this will reduce compliance burden concerns while continuing to assure that borrowers receive specific prices or estimates that are likely to provide strong motivation to renew their homeowners' insurance policies. Additionally, the regulatory text is changed to refer to a “reasonable estimate” rather than a “good faith estimate,” and the commentary is changed to clarify what a “reasonable estimate” means.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters recommended that the Bureau allow servicers to provide a borrower with additional information about force-placed insurance. They stated that servicers currently provide a number of disclosures in addition to the information the Bureau has proposed in response to State disclosure requirements, class action litigation, and industry best practices. Commenters expressed concern that the failure by servicers to include additional information may subject servicers to further litigation and extensive potential liability. Some commenters suggested that the Bureau permit servicers to include additional information and the required information in one document. One large bank servicer suggested an alternative approach where a servicer would be permitted to include additional information in the same transmittal that is used to provide notices containing the required information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that providing additional information in the same notice as the required information could obscure the most important information or tend to create information overload. For instance, one industry commenter provided a list of additional information that included 10 specific pieces of information and a catch-all category for disclosures related to force-placed insurance imposed by other State or Federal law. The Bureau believes it would be better if servicers have latitude to provide the additional information on separate pieces of paper in the same transmittal. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting new § 1024.37(c)(4) to provide that a servicer may not include any information other than information required by § 1024.37(c)(2) in the written notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), but that a servicer may provide such additional information to a borrower in the same transmittal as the transmittal used to provide the notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) but on separate pieces of paper. The Bureau is adopting parallel provisions in § 1024.37(d) and (e), numbered as § 1024.37(d)(4) and (e)(4), respectively. The Bureau has also revised § 1024.37(c)(2) to permit the notice required by § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) to include, if applicable, a statement advising a borrower to review additional information provided in the same transmittal. The Bureau has adopted parallel provisions in § 1024.37(d) and (e).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>As previously discussed, section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) of RESPA establishes that a servicer must provide a borrower with two written notices before charging a borrower for force-placed insurance. To implement this provision, the Bureau proposed § 1024.37(c)(3) and (d)(3) in parallel. Proposed 1024.37(c)(3) stated that disclosures set forth in proposed § 1024.37(c)(2) must be in a format substantially similar to form MS-3(A), set forth in appendix MS-3. Disclosures made pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(2)(vi) and (c)(2)(ix) must be in bold text. Disclosure made pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(2)(iv) must be in bold text, except that the physical address of the borrower's property may be in regular text. The Bureau believed the use of bold text to bring attention to important information would make it easier for borrowers to identify promptly the purpose of the notice and to find the information quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the Bureau stated in the proposal that the Bureau believed that it was important to bring attention to the cost of force-placed insurance so borrowers have a clear understanding of the cost to them of the service that servicers provide in obtaining force-placed insurance. The Bureau further noted that it believed that it was important for borrowers to understand that the servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance arises from the borrower's obligation to maintain hazard insurance. Although the notice contains additional information that is important, the Bureau believes the usefulness of highlighting in focusing a borrower's attention on important information decreases if highlighting is used unsparingly.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One large bank servicer commended the Bureau for the model forms the Bureau proposed. It observed that the forms were thoughtfully designed and should be readily understandable to consumers. Another large bank servicer agreed with the Bureau's rationale that model forms facilitate compliance with the new Dodd-Frank Act requirements concerning force-placed insurance disclosures and the Bureau's proposed supplemental disclosures, but sought clarification that servicers may use the model forms as guidance but are not required to demonstrate strict adherence to the language of the forms. One non-bank servicer argued that disclosure forms should generally be open-ended to allow the servicer to provide all the content required by the Bureau while allowing the servicer to tailor the form to its needs; however, the commenter stated that it did not have concerns with the model force-placed insurance forms the Bureau proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In consideration of the comments received and based on further consideration, the Bureau is changing § 1024.37(c)(3) to no longer require a servicer to provide the information required by § 1024.37(c)(2) in a form “substantially similar” to form MS-3A, as set forth in appendix MS-3. As adopted, § 1024.37(c)(3) provides that a servicer may use form MS-3A in appendix MS-3 to comply with the requirements of § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) and (2). However, the Bureau is adopting a final § 1024.37(c)(3) that generally contains the highlighting requirements set forth in the proposal.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) of RESPA, added by section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, states that a servicer must send two written notices to the borrower prior to charging the borrower for force-placed insurance. Specifically, RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(B) requires servicers to use first-class mail to send a second written notice to the borrower, at least 30 days after mailing initial the notice required by RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A), that contains all the information described in section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A)(i) through (iv) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(d)(1) to implement section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(B) of RESPA. Proposed § 1024.37(d)(1) stated that one written notice in addition to the written notice required pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) must be delivered to the borrower or placed in the mail prior to a servicer charging a borrower for force-placed insurance. It further stated that the servicer may not deliver or place this second written notice under § 1024.37(d)(1) in the mail until 30 days after delivering to the borrower or placing in the mail the first written notice under § 1024.37(c)(1)(i). Proposed § 1024.37(d)(1) would also have mandated that a servicer that receives no insurance information after delivering or placing in the mail the written notice required pursuant to in § 1024.37(c)(1)(i) must provide the disclosures set forth in § 1024.37(d)(2)(i), while a servicer that does receive insurance information but is unable to verify that the borrower has hazard insurance coverage continuously must provide the disclosures set forth in § 1024.37(d)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 37(d)(1)-1 would have explained the content of the reminder notice will vary depending on the insurance information the servicer has received from the borrower. Two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry urged the Bureau to permit servicers to use the same letter they sent to a borrower to comply with the first written notice requirement to comply with the second written notice requirement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau noted in the proposal, section 6(k)(1)(B) of RESPA can be read to require a servicer to provide the same disclosures a borrower has previously received. However, where a borrower responds to the first notice by providing insurance information, the Bureau believed that the reminder notice would be more useful if it contained an acknowledgement of the information these borrowers provided in response to the first notice and informed these borrowers that the information provided was not sufficient for a servicer to verify that they had continuous coverage in place. The Bureau observed in the proposal that simply repeating the same content as the first notice might cause borrowers to become frustrated and confused by the fact that they are receiving another notice asking for insurance information when they thought they had already provided such information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.37(c)(1), some industry commenters urged the Bureau to withdraw the requirement that a servicer send a borrower a second notice before charging a borrower for force-placed insurance. As the Bureau observed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.37(c)(1), Congress specifically required that two notices be provided before a servicer charges a borrower for force-placed insurance. For reasons discussed above, the Bureau does not believe that varying from this statutory scheme is appropriate. Further, comments from two large force-placed insurance providers suggest that at least by the time of the second notice, servicers will be able to provide borrowers with a reasonable estimate of the cost of the force-placed insurance, so that the second notice will complement the first.<footnote ref="111">The commenters suggested that if the Bureau was going to adopt the requirement that servicers must provide the actual cost (or good faith estimate of the cost) of force-placed insurance, the requirement should be limited to the second notice.</footnote>
            Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(d)(1) as proposed with an adjustment to emphasize that a servicer may not charge a borrower for force-placed insurance unless it has delivered or mailed the second written notice at least 15 days prior to imposing such charge.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(d)(2) to address the content of the second required notice. Proposed § 1024.37(d)(2)(i) would have set forth the information that a servicer must provide in the written notice established by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(B) of RESPA to a borrower from whom the servicer has not received any insurance information. Proposed § 1024.37(d)(2)(ii) would have set forth the information required where the servicer received insurance information from the borrower within 30 days after delivering to the borrower or placing in the mail the written notice set forth § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), but not was not able to verify that the borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.37(d)(2)(i) would have required that if a servicer that has not received any insurance information from the borrower within 30 days after delivering or placing in the mail the notice required pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), the servicer must provide a reminder notice that contains the disclosures forth in § 1024.37(c)(2)(ii) to (c)(2)(xi), the date of the notice, and a statement that the notice is the second and final notice. The Bureau explained in the proposal that it believes that the date of the notice and a statement that the notice is the second and final notice helps to distinguish the notice from the notice required pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(1)(i). Moreover, because the servicer would not have received any insurance information, the Bureau believed it would be appropriate to require the servicer to provide the disclosures set forth in § 1024.37(c)(2)(ii) to (c)(2)(xi) in the second written notice sent to a borrower who has not sent the servicer any insurance information in response to the first written notice.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>As described above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.37(c)(2), a number of industry commenters requested the Bureau to withdraw the requirement to provide the cost of force-placed insurance (or a good faith estimate of the cost) and to permit servicers to include additional information in the force-placed insurance notices the Bureau proposed. For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is keeping the requirement to provide the cost of force-placed insurance (revised to refer to a “reasonable estimate” rather than a “good faith estimate”) in the second notice and not permitting a servicer to include additional information in a second reminder notice. The Bureau has also added new comment 37(d)(2)(i)(D)-1 to clarify what a “reasonable estimate” means.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>37(d)(4) Updating Notice With Borrower Information</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(d)(4) to provide that if a servicer receives hazard insurance information from a borrower after the second written notice required pursuant to § 1024.37(d)(1) has been put into production, the servicer is not required to update the notice so long as the notice was put into production within a reasonable time prior to the servicer delivering the notice to the borrower or placing the notice in the mail. The Bureau proposed related commentary, comment 37(d)(4)-1, that would have provided that five days prior to the delivery or mailing of the second notice is a reasonable time and invited comments on whether, in certain circumstances, a longer time frame is reasonable.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau observes that one of the minimum consumer protection purposes Congress intended to establish by creating new servicer duties with respect to a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance is to provide a borrower with reasonably accurate information about a servicer's grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance. The Bureau believes that a servicer has a duty to ensure that the second notice contains reasonably accurate information about an individual borrower's hazard insurance status. Therefore, the Bureau believes that a servicer has a duty to update the second notice if it receives new insurance information about a borrower after sending the first written notice to the borrower. The Bureau, however, observed in the proposal that a servicer might have to prepare the written notice in advance of sending it. Accordingly, the Bureau explained that it believed that it was appropriate to create a safe harbor of five days to protect a servicer acting diligently from exposure to potential litigation if the information the servicer provided in the second notice turns out to be, in fact, inaccurate, due to information about a borrower's hazard insurance it receives subsequent to putting the second notice into production.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One force-placed insurance provider and two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry recommended the Bureau withdraw proposed § 1024.37(d)(4) or, in the alternative, expand the safe harbor to 10 days, excluding legal holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, because some servicers use third-party service providers to prepare force-placed insurance notices and need a period of longer than 5 days to prepare the notices. The force-placed insurance provider contended that servicers are going to update the second notice or not send the second notice at all if they have received verification of a borrower's hazard insurance because they would not want to send their customers unnecessary notices. Two other force-placed insurance providers also recommended that the safe harbor be expanded to 10 days from the date that a borrower's insurance is verified, but did not indicate whether 10 days should exclude legal holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau observes that as discussed above, the intent of § 1024.37(d)(4) is to create a safe harbor to protect servicers who are diligent in ensuring that borrowers receive reasonably accurate information from potential litigation risk. Accordingly, the Bureau is concerned that a 10-day safe harbor, even one that includes legal public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, would be overbroad and give the benefit of the safe harbor to servicers who are not diligent in ensuring that borrowers receive accurate information. But the Bureau has concluded that servicers that use third-party service providers to prepare force-placed insurance notices could reasonably require more than 5 days to prepare the second written notice in a timely manner, especially a five-day period that includes a legal public holiday, Saturday, or Sunday. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 37(d)(4)-1 with a change to clarify that the 5-day period excludes legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The Bureau believes this adjustment strikes the right balance between achieving the consumer protection of providing a borrower with accurate information about a servicer's grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance and providing diligent servicers with a safe harbor from potential litigation risk.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(e)(1) to provide that that a servicer may not charge a borrower for renewing or replacing existing force-placed insurance unless: (1) The servicer delivers or places in the mail a written notice to the borrower with the disclosures set forth in § 1024.37(e)(2) at least 45 days before the premium charge or any fee is assessed; and (2) during the 45-day notice period, the servicer has not received evidence that the borrower has obtained hazard insurance. The Bureau stated in the proposal that it believed that the procedures it proposed concerning renewal and replacement would provide advance notice to allow a borrower the time the borrower may need to buy hazard insurance before being charged again for the cost of force-placed insurance at renewal or replacement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not believe a servicer should have to wait until the end of the notice period before charging a borrower for the cost of renewing the force-placed insurance if a borrower has confirmed that there was a gap in coverage with respect to a borrower who obtains hazard insurance after receiving the renewal notice. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed § 1024.37(e)(1)(iii) to permit a servicer who has renewed or replaced existing force-placed insurance during the notice period to charge a borrower for such renewal or replacement promptly after a servicer receives verification that the hazard insurance obtained by a borrower did not provide a borrower with insurance coverage for any period of time following the expiration of the existing force-placed insurance, notwithstanding § 1024.37(e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii). The Bureau proposed comment 37(e)(1)(iii)-1 to provide an example of what this means.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry observed that it is common industry practice for a servicer to send renewal notice to borrowers but urged that the Bureau permit servicers to charge a borrower for the renewal of existing force-placed insurance at the time of purchase because a servicer should not have to incur the burden of not being able to impose a charge on a borrower related to force-placed insurance at the time of renewal or replacement. The Bureau declines to modify the proposal because the Bureau believes imposing a notice period during which a servicer is prohibited from charging a borrower for force-placed insurance is appropriate and necessary to help a borrower avoid the cost associated with the borrower's servicer renewing or replacing the borrower's hazard insurance. The Bureau further notes that a servicer can provide the 45-day notice in advance of the expiration of the current forced place coverage, and accordingly, disagrees that § 1024.37(e)(1) would invariably prohibit a servicer from imposing a charge on a borrower related to force-placed insurance at the time of renewal or replacement. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(e)(1) as proposed, except technical changes to clarify what evidence of borrower's coverage means for § 1024.37(e)(1). New comment 37(e)(1)-1 clarifies that a servicer may require a borrower to provide a form of written confirmation as described in comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-3 and may reject evidence of coverage submitted by the borrower for the reasons described in comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-2. Comment 37(e)(1)(iii) is adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>37(e)(2) Content of Renewal Notice</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.37(e)(2) would have required a servicer to provide a number of the disclosures set forth in in proposed § 1024.37(c)(2) in the renewal notice. The Bureau explained in the proposal that the main differences between the disclosures set forth in proposed § 1024.37(c)(2) and proposed § 1024.37(e)(2) are that in proposed § 1024.37(e)(2), servicers must provide a statement that: (1) The servicer previously obtained insurance on the borrower's property and assessed the cost of the insurance to the borrower because the servicer did not have evidence that the borrower had hazard insurance coverage for the property; and (2) the servicer has the right to maintain insurance by renewing or replacing the insurance it previously obtained because insurance is required. The Bureau believes the differences are necessary to distinguish the notice required pursuant to proposed § 1024.37(e)(1) from the notice required pursuant to proposed § 1024.37(c)(1). The proposed requirement in § 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) concerning provision of the cost of the force-placed insurance, stated as an annual premium, or a good faith estimate of such cost, would have been replicated in proposed § 1024.37(e)(2)(vii), with related commentary that would have explained that the good faith requirement set forth in § 1024.37(e)(2)(vii) is the same good faith requirement set forth in § 1024.37(c)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The comments the Bureau received with respect to the content of the force-placed insurance notices under § 1024.37(c)(2) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> comments about the requirement to provide a good-faith estimate and requests to be allowed to provide additional information) also apply to proposed § 1024.37(e)(2). The Bureau believes that the burden of providing a good faith estimate is lower for purposes of § 1024.37(e)(2) than for purposes of providing such an estimate for purposes of § 1024.37(c)(2) because a servicer can provide such an estimate based on the amount of current premiums. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting this requirement in the final rule (revised to refer to a “reasonable estimate”) and made technical changes in related commentary to reflect this revision. For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is not permitting a servicer to include additional information in the notice required by § 1024.37(e)(1). But, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting new § 1024.37(e)(4) to permit servicers to provide additional information in the same transmittal the servicer uses to provide the replacement or renewal notice.</analysisParagraph>

Further, proposed § 1024.37(e)(4) would have provided that a servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.37(e)(1) before charging a borrower for renewing or replacing existing force-placed insurance more than once every 12 months.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau explained that the Bureau did not believe receiving more than one renewal or replacement notice in a 12-month period was necessary because borrowers should be able to retain the first notice under proposed § 1024.37(e)(1), including the cost or estimate information, for future reference. The Bureau also noted that some small servicers who participated in the Small Business Review Panel expressed concerns about the cost of sending renewal notices over a 12-month period because unlike large servicers, a number of small servicers purchase force-placed insurance policies that would have to be renewed monthly. The Bureau, however, solicited comments on whether providing the renewal or replacement notice once during a 12-month period would adequately inform borrowers about the costs, benefits, and risks associated with servicers' renewal or replacement of existing force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One large force-placed insurance provider commented that one notice per year is sufficient to remind borrowers without overly burdening the servicer or potentially inundating borrowers with multiple and repetitive notices. In contrast, a state consumer group asserted that one notice over a 12-month period may not be enough to adequately inform borrowers of the costs, benefits, and risks of servicer's renewal or replacement of force-placed insurance and urged the Bureau to require a servicer to provide at least two renewal notices over a 12-month period to inform borrowers of the force-placed insurance premium they would be charged.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has further considered the issue but continues to believe for the reasons stated in the proposal that one annual renewal notice will adequately inform borrowers of the costs, benefits, and risks of servicer's renewal or replacement of force-placed insurance. Additionally, the Bureau notes that in conjunction with the Bureau's periodic statement rule, most borrowers whose servicers are charging them for force-placed insurance will be made aware of that fact because a servicer will be required to list force-placed insurance charges on periodic statements. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1024.37(e)(4) as proposed, renumbered as § 1024.37(e)(5) in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>37(e) Renewal or Replacement of Force-Placed Insurance</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(e) to prohibit a servicer from charging a borrower for the replacement or renewal of an existing force-placed insurance policy unless certain procedural requirements are followed as specified in proposed § 1024.37(e). The Bureau proposed the requirements because pre-proposal outreach suggested that there is no widespread industry standard that applies to renewal procedures for force-placed insurance. Moreover, commissions and reinsurance agreements may create strong incentives at renewal as well as at original placement. The Bureau believes that the renewal notice is authorized under RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>), which provides that a servicer does not have a reasonable basis to obtain force-placed insurance unless certain notice requirements are met, and does not limit such requirements to the first time a servicer obtains and charges a borrower for force-placed insurance. The Bureau has, however, made certain adjustments to the notice and procedure requirements set forth in RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>), as described below, to account for the fact that in the case of the renewal of forced-placed insurance, the borrower already will have received at least two prior force-placed insurance notices. Section 1024.37(e) is further authorized under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA as necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including avoiding unwarranted charges and fees and ensuring the provision to borrowers of accurate and relevant information. As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1024.37(e) generally as proposed with a few changes to address issues that were raised in comments.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) of RESPA, discussed previously, establishes that servicers must use first-class mail to send the notices established by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1)(A) and (B) of RESPA. The Bureau proposed to implement this aspect of section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(1) of RESPA by adding new § 1024.37(f) to provide that if a servicer mails a notice required pursuant to § 1024.37(c)(1)(i), (d)(1), or (e)(1) of this section, a servicer must use a class of mail not less than first-class mail.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to allow servicers to transmit the force-placed notices required under § 1024.37 by a class of mail better than first. The Bureau observed in the proposal that although the notice required by proposed § 1024.37(e)(1) is not required by RESPA, applying the same mailing requirements to all notices under § 1024.37 would facilitate compliance by promoting consistency. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 1024.37(f) and is adopting § 1024.37(f) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>37(g) Cancellation of Force-Placed Insurance</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(a) added new section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3) to RESPA, which states that within 15 days of receipt by a servicer of confirmation of a borrower's existing insurance coverage, the servicer must: (1) Terminate the force-placed insurance; and (2) refund to the borrower all force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower during any period in which the borrower's insurance and the force-placed insurance were both in effect. The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(g)(1) and (2) to implement section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3) of RESPA. Section 1024.37(g)(1) and (2) would have provided that within 15 days of receiving verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place, a servicer must cancel force-placed insurance obtained for a borrower's property and for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place, refund to the borrower all force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower for such period. Proposed § 1024.37(g)(2) would have also required a servicer to remove all force-placed insurance charges and related fees that the servicer has assessed to the borrower for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place from the borrower's account. The Bureau believes that Congress, by establishing the duty to provide a full refund of the force-placed insurance premium and related charges paid by a borrower for any period of time during which the borrower's hazard insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were both in effect, also intended to establish the duty to remove a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance for such period. Accordingly, the Bureau interprets the statutory duty to provide such refund to include the duty to remove all force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees charged to a borrower's account for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were both in effect.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters asserted that a borrower should not have an unconditional right to receive a refund for all force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower during any period of overlapping coverage. They asserted that it would not be reasonable for a servicer to absorb the cost of the refund if a borrower does not provide evidence of insurance in a timely manner or if a servicer had a reasonable basis to purchase force-placed insurance. Some commenters asserted that an unconditional right to a refund would encourage borrowers to act irresponsibly by not providing evidence of insurance in a timely manner. One state housing finance agency and a force-placed insurance provider suggested that servicers needed 15 business days to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a borrower with refunds in an orderly manner and asked the Bureau to adjust the timelines accordingly.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.37(g) as proposed, with adjustments to the regulatory language for clarity. While a number of commenters indicated that they understood “receiving verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place” meant receiving evidence of insurance coverage, just as the Bureau has adjusted the text of §§ 1024.37(c)(1)(iii), (d)(2)(ii), and (e)(1)(iii), to clarify what “receiving verification” means, the Bureau has made similar revisions to enhance the clarity of § 1024.37(g).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Additionally, in finalizing § 1024.37(g)(2), the Bureau has replaced the proposed phrase “for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place” with the phrase “for any period of overlapping insurance coverage” because the Bureau believes the language “periods of overlapping coverage” more closely aligns with the statutory language “any period during which the borrower's insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were each in effect” in RESPA section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3). The Bureau is adopting new comment 37(g)(2)-1 to explain what “period of overlapping insurance coverage” means for purposes of § 1024.37(g)(2). The Bureau, however, is not adopting proposed comment 37(g)-1 because upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that further elaboration on what a servicer must do to comply with § 1024.37(g) is not required.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to commenters asserting that a borrower should not have an unconditional right to a full refund of force-placed insurance premiums and related fees paid by the borrower, the Bureau notes that section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3) of RESPA expressly establishes that a borrower's right to a full refund for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance and the force-placed insurance were both in effect is an unconditional one. Moreover, based on consumer testing and other outreach, the Bureau is skeptical that the statutory regime will cause borrowers to be less diligent in responding to notices from their servicers asking them to provide evidence demonstrating insurance coverage and result in servicers having to absorb significant costs.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, across all rounds of testing, participants uniformly understood the timeliness of their response upon the receipt of force-placed insurance notices affected whether or not they would have to pay for force-placed insurance. All participants said they would take immediate action because they did not want to bear the expense of force-placed insurance.<footnote ref="112">ICF Int'l, Inc., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Summary of Findings: Design and Testing of Mortgage Servicing Disclosures&lt;/em&gt; 24-29 (Aug. 2012) (&amp;#8220;Macro Report&amp;#8221;), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;

            The uniformity of the responses supports the Bureau's belief that the substantially higher cost of force-placed insurance provides borrowers with a natural incentive to provide their servicers with evidence of insurance coverage in a timely manner.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, based on outreach the Bureau has done with force-placed insurance providers and servicers, as well as based on public statements made by these entities and comment letters the Bureau has received from industry, the Bureau observes that the typical force-placed insurance on the market provides for flat cancellation (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the force-placed insurance provider provides a full refund of force-placed insurance premiums paid by the borrower for any period of time where the force-placed insurance and the borrower's hazard insurance coverage were both in effect).<footnote ref="113">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Services, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Testimony of John Frobose, President of American Security Insurance Company (ASIC)&lt;/em&gt; 6 (describing that if ASIC receives proof that there was no gap in hazard insurance coverage on a borrower's property, ASIC refunds all force-placed insurance premiums paid); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also,&lt;/em&gt; N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Services, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Written Testimony of Nicholas Pastor and Matthew Freeman on behalf of QBE Insurance Corporation and QBE FIRST Insurance Agency&lt;/em&gt; 15 (stating that if the borrower provides proof of voluntary insurance such that there was no lapse in the voluntary coverage, all premiums paid by a borrower or deducted from a borrower's escrow account are refunded, regardless of when the borrower provided the proof of voluntary coverage): &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See further,&lt;/em&gt; N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Services, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Written Testimony of Justin Crowley on behalf of Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc, Pelatis Insurance Agency Corp. and Pelatis Insurance Limited&lt;/em&gt; 5 (stating that it provides a full refund equal to the total amount of force-placed insurance premiums charged to the borrower's account for any period during which the borrower maintained his or her own homeowners' coverage) (copies of the aforementioned testimonies are available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/hearing/fp_052012_testimony.htm&lt;/em&gt;).</footnote>
            Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe that servicers will have to absorb significant costs.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further declines to adjust the timeline a servicer must follow to cancel fore-placed insurance and refund force-place premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of the defined term “Day” in § 1024.31, the Bureau believes that Congress intended the term “day” by itself to mean a calendar day for purposes of RESPA. The 15-day timeline for cancellation and refund is expressly established by section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3) of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, based on the Bureau's outreach and public statements made by force-placed insurance providers and servicers, the Bureau understands that servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance is generally a rare occurrence. If the volume of force-placement is small to begin with, then the Bureau is skeptical that requiring servicers to follow the statutorily-prescribed timeline would overwhelm a servicer or otherwise impose too large of a burden. Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to deviate from the statutory-determined timeline set forth in section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(3).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A large force-placed insurance provider, a state trade association representing mortgage lenders, and a bank servicer expressed concern that § 1024.37(g), as proposed, would be construed as requiring a servicer to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a full refund even if a borrower's hazard insurance policy does not meet the loan contract's requirements. Although the Bureau does not believe that it was reasonable to construe proposed § 1024.37(g) to require a servicer to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a full refund even if a borrower's hazard insurance policy does not meet the loan contract's requirements, the Bureau believes that in any event, the commenters' concern is adequately addressed by § 1024.37(g), which, as adopted, clarifies that “receiving verification” in proposed § 1024.37(g) means receiving evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had hazard insurance in place that complies the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Lastly, one large bank servicer expressed concern that the obligation to refund a borrower for force-placed insurance premiums and related fees paid by the borrower triggers a subsequent escrow analysis disclosure set forth in current § 1024.17(c)(3), which requires a servicer to perform an escrow account analysis at the completion of the escrow account computation year, which is defined in current § 1024.17(b) as “a 12-month period that a servicer establishes for the escrow account beginning with the borrower's initial payment date.” Providing a refund to a borrower in accordance with § 1024.37(g), by itself, does not trigger the obligation to perform an escrow account analysis required by current § 1024.17(c)(3).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>37(h) Limitation on Force-Placed Insurance Charges</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 6 by adding new section 6(m) to RESPA, which states that apart from charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance, all charges related to force-placed insurance imposed on the borrower by or through the servicer must be bona fide and reasonable. Proposed § 1024.37(h)(1) generally mirrored the statutory language by providing that except for charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance and charges authorized by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, all charges related to force-placed insurance assessed to a borrower by or through the servicer must be bona fide and reasonable. Proposed § 1024.37(h)(2) would have provided that a bona fide and reasonable charge is a charge for a service actually performed that bears a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, and is not otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the proposal that the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 establishes that notwithstanding any Federal or State law, any servicer for a loan “secured by improved real estate or a mobile home” may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special flood hazard zone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 42 U.S.C. 4012a(h). As discussed in the proposal and explained above, the Bureau was concerned about issuing regulations that would overlap with regulations issued pursuant to the FDPA, and believed that borrowers would be confused by receiving overlapping notices under the two regimes with respect to the same flood insurance policy. Accordingly, as discussed above, the Bureau used its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to exempt hazard insurance to protect against flood loss obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of force-placed insurance. Consistent with this exemption and for the same reasons, the Bureau believed that it was necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions to use it authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to exempt charges authorized by the FDPA from proposed § 1024.37(h). The Bureau received no comments on the exemption and is adopting this aspect of § 1024.37(h)(1) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to proposed § 1024.37(h)(2), which would have set forth the Bureau's proposed definition of “bona fide and reasonable charge,” the Bureau noted in the proposal that the Bureau believed it was important that servicers do not try to inflate the already-high cost of force-placed insurance by assessing charges to borrowers that are not for services actually performed, do not bear a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, or are prohibited by applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One non-bank servicer commended the proposed definition of “bona fide and reasonable charge” and predicted that the Bureau's proposal would stop many of the abusive servicer practices that have damaged the industry's reputation over the past few years. But a national trade association representing the consumer credit industry contended that the proposed definition would create an ambiguous standard that would expose lenders to class action lawsuits and infringe on state insurance departments' sole authority to regulate insurance rates.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Other comments received from a national trade association representing realtors and several consumer groups urged the Bureau to go further in regulating charges related to force-placed insurance that a servicer imposes on a borrower. The realtors association urged the Bureau to mandate affordable force-placed insurance premiums. One consumer group urged the Bureau to ban servicers or their affiliates from receiving any fee, commission, kickback, reinsurance contract, or any other thing of value for a force-placed insurance provider in exchange for purchasing force-placed insurance, and to prohibit a servicer from obtaining an amount of force-placed insurance coverage greater than the replacement cost value of the borrower's property. Two national consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should expressly exclude unreasonable costs and other costs unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance. Two other national consumer groups asserted that the Bureau should expressly exclude commissions or other compensation paid by a force-placed insurance provider or its agent to a servicer or any affiliate of the servicer, costs associated with insurance tracking, cost for activities for which a servicer is being reimbursed by the owner of the mortgage, costs associated with the administration of reinsurance programs, cost to subsidize unrelated servicer activities, and any cost that is not directly related to the provision of force-placed insurance. They also urged the Bureau to provide guidance about prohibited fees that is consistent with Fannie Mae's proposed changes to its servicing guidelines on force-placed insurance.<footnote ref="114">Fannie Mae issued a servicing announcement stating that any servicer requesting reimbursement of force-placed insurance premiums must exclude any lender-placed insurance commission earned on that policy by the servicer or any related entity, costs associated with insurance tracking or administration, or any other costs beyond the actual cost of the lender-placed insurance policy premium. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Fannie Mae, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Updates to Lender-Placed Property Insurance and Hazard Insurance Claims Processing&lt;/em&gt; (Mar. 14, 2012), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;https://www.fanniemae.com/content/announcement/svc1204.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.

            These commenters further asserted that State insurance regulators have no authority over a charge that a servicer imposes on a borrower for force-placed insurance because a servicer is not an entity regulated by state insurance regulators.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments submitted, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to finalize § 1024.37(h)(2) as proposed. The Bureau believes § 1024.37(h) appropriately implements RESPA 6(m)'s “bona fide and reasonable” requirement in a way that does not overlap with state insurance departments' authority to regulation insurance rates. Further, the Bureau believes § 1024.37(h) provides clear guidance for servicers by unambiguously prohibiting a servicer from charging a borrower for a service it did not perform, or charging a borrower a fee that does not bear a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, or that would be otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request that the Bureau should revise the definition of “bona fide and reasonable charges” to exclude unreasonable costs, other costs unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance, and cost to subsidize servicing activities unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance, the Bureau believes that the proposed and final definition already exclude such charges.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to requests that the Bureau mandate affordable force-placed insurance premiums, prohibit servicers from receiving commission or similar fees or things of value, prohibit fees associated with the cost of administration of reinsurance programs or insurance tracking, the Bureau recognizes the concerns, but believes the provisions of § 1024.37 provide adequate safeguards to borrowers and consistent with the regulatory scheme mandated by Congress.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request that the Bureau prohibit servicers from charging borrowers for costs that could be reimbursed by the owner of the mortgage loan, the Bureau believes that where a servicer charges a borrower for first-placed insurance in accordance with the requirements under § 1024.37, it is reasonable for the borrower, rather than the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan, to bear the costs of such insurance. With respect to the request that the Bureau exclude costs not directly related to force-placed insurance from the definition of “bona fide and reasonable charges,” the Bureau believes that the bona fide and reasonable standard provides adequate protection to borrowers without distinguishing between whether a charge is “directly” or “indirectly” related to force-placed insurance. Such a standard would thus inject addition complexity without concomitant consumer benefit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request that the Bureau provide guidance about prohibited fees that is consistent with Fannie Mae's proposed changes to its servicing guidelines, the Bureau carefully reviewed Fannie Mae's servicing announcement and concluded that it would not be appropriate to provide similar guidance. The draft guidance simply informs servicers that Fannie Mae no longer plans to reimburse a servicer for certain servicer expenses related to servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance and importantly, it offers no guidance on the charges a servicer may impose on a borrower with respect to a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance. Additionally, the Bureau believes that the prohibitions and requirements with respect to force-placed insurance under § 1024.37 provide adequate protection to borrowers and that there is no reason to depart from the scheme established by Congress to regulate force-placed insurance by importing Fannie Mae's guidance regarding prohibited fees into the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Lastly, with regard to the argument that no charge imposed by a servicer is subject to State regulation as the business of insurance because a servicer is not regulated by State insurance regulators, the Bureau believes the language of section 6(m) of RESPA clearly contemplates that servicers may pass through charges that are subject to State regulation as the business of insurance to a borrower, and the fact that such charge is passed through by the servicer does not mean that such charge is no longer subject to State regulation as the business of insurance. For the foregoing reasons, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(h)(2) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6 of RESPA to add new section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>)(4) to provide that the new Dodd-Frank Act requirements concerning force-placed insurance do not prohibit servicers from sending a simultaneous or concurrent notice of a lack of flood insurance pursuant to section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act (FDPA). The Bureau proposed § 1024.37(i) to provide that if permitted by regulation under section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, a servicer subject to the requirements of § 1024.37 may deliver to the borrower or place in the mail any notice required by § 1024.37 together with the notice required by section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One national trade association representing banks and insurance providers urged the Bureau to permit servicers to combine the notice required pursuant to the FDPA with any notice required pursuant to § 1024.37. One state consumer group expressed concern that a borrower might be confused if it receives a notice required pursuant to § 1024.37 and a notice required pursuant to the FDPA at the same time. The commenter observed that the notices should be distinguishable from each other and should state that there is a difference between the two notices.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Congress vested other Federal regulators with the authority to issue regulations under the FDPA, and thus, the Bureau cannot revise the content of notices required under the FDPA. With respect to potential confusion caused by receiving concurrent notices, the Bureau notes that it has excluded insurance required under the FDPA from the definition of force-placed insurance so that borrowers will not receive overlapping notices under § 1024.37 and the FDPA with respect to the same insurance policy. To the extent borrowers receive separate notices under § 1024.37 and the FDPA with respect to separate insurance policies, the Bureau further believes that borrowers will be able to distinguish the notices under the two regulatory schemes based on their content. The Bureau also observes that it has addressed compliance burden by permitting under final § 1024.37(i) that notices under the FDPA and § 1024.37 could be provided to borrowers in the same transmittal. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.37(i) as proposed, except with adjustment just described. As adopted, § 1024.37(i) states if permitted by regulation under section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, a servicer subject to the requirements of § 1024.37 may deliver to the borrower or place in the mail any notice required by § 1024.37 and the notice required by section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 on separate pieces of paper in the same transmittal.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1024.37 Force-Placed Insurance</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6 of RESPA to establish new servicer duties with respect to servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance on a property securing a federally related mortgage loan. The statute generally defines “force-placed insurance” as hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage loan. New § 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA states that a servicer shall not obtain force-placed insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance. New section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) of RESPA further states that servicers must: (1) provide two written notices to a borrower over a notification period lasting at least 45 days before imposing a charge for force-placed insurance on the borrower; (2) accept any reasonable form of written confirmation from a borrower of existing insurance coverage; and (3) within 15 days of the receipt of confirmation of a borrower's existing insurance coverage, terminate force-placed insurance and refund all force-placed insurance premiums paid by the borrower during any period during which the borrower's insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were both in effect, as well as any related fees charged to the borrower's account with respect to force-placed insurance during such period. Section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) of RESPA additionally states that no provisions of section 6(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>) shall be construed as prohibiting a servicer from providing simultaneous or concurrent notice of a lack of flood insurance pursuant to section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Section 6(m) of RESPA states that all charges related to force-placed insurance imposed on a borrower by or through a servicer, other than charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance, must be bona fide and reasonable.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.37 to implement the new servicer duties established by section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act in section 6(k) through (m) of RESPA. Force-placed insurance was created by the insurance industry to provide mortgage loan owners and investors with a hazard insurance product that would protect the value of their investment by insuring properties securing mortgage loans when hazard insurance obtained by a borrower lapsed. In recent years, however, force-placed insurance has become a consumer protection concern and has attracted the attention of lawmakers, enforcement officials, and Federal and State regulators.<footnote ref="105">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; H.R. Rep. 111-94, at 55 (calling the force-placement of insurance without a reasonable basis a problematic method used by some servicers to increase revenue); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also further,&lt;/em&gt; Compl., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;United States of America&lt;/em&gt; et al. v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; et al. at &amp;#182; 51 (alleging that the defendant servicers engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the discharge of their loan servicing activities by imposing force-placed insurance without properly notifying the borrowers and when borrowers already had adequate coverage) (filed on March 14, 2012); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see further, N.Y. Orders `Force-Placed' Insurers to Submit New Lower Rate Proposals,&lt;/em&gt; Ins. J., June 13, 2012 (describing that New York State's Department of Financial Services ordered three force-placed insurance providers to submit new force-placed insurance premium rates after determining that the insurers overcharged New York homeowners).</footnote>
            First, a force-placed insurance policy typically provides less coverage than the typical homeowners' insurance policy because force-placed insurance has been designed to provide coverage limited to protecting the value of the dwelling, but not personal property, personal liabilities for injuries on site, and other types of loss included in the scope of coverage of a typical homeowners' insurance policy. Second, although a force-placed insurance policy generally provides less coverage than a homeowners' insurance policy, force-placed insurance policy premiums are generally substantially more expensive than homeowners' insurance policy premiums. One large force-placed insurance provider estimates that the force-placed policies it writes cost, on average, 1.5 to 2 times more than the prior hazard insurance purchased by a borrower.<footnote ref="106">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Assurant Specialty Property, Lender-Placed Insurance, available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://newsroom.assurant.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=645046&amp;amp;ReleaseType=Featured%20News&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            But at the same time, it has been reported that an individual force-placed policy could cost 10 times as much as a homeowners' insurance policy.<footnote ref="107">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Horowitz, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Ties to Insurers Could Land Mortgage Servicers in More Trouble,&lt;/em&gt; Am. Banker (Nov. 9, 2010.)</footnote>
            Explanations for the cost of force-placed insurance differ. Industry stakeholders generally attribute the substantially higher cost of force-placed insurance (relative to homeowners' insurance) to the fact that force-placed insurance: (1) Can be purchased for every mortgage loan in a servicer's portfolio (including vacant properties and other properties that homeowners' insurance providers will not insure); (2) ensures continuous coverage as of the date a homeowners' insurance policy lapses or is canceled; and (3) can be canceled by a servicer at any time, with a full refund back to the date of placement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups, however, assert that the higher cost of force-placed insurance can be largely explained by market mechanisms that drive force-placed insurance providers to compete for business from servicers. Consumer groups argue that the cost of force-placed insurance is inflated by incentives like commissions to servicers (or their affiliates) that are licensed to engage in insurance transactions, no-cost or below-cost insurance tracking and monitoring services to servicers because the actual cost is passed on to borrowers in the force-placed insurance premium charge a force-placed insurance provider assesses on a borrower through the servicer, and payments for entering into reinsurance arrangements with servicers (or their affiliates) that are licensed to engage in insurance transactions. Consumer groups and mortgage investors have alleged that servicers have frequently improperly placed force-placed insurance, in some instances to receive lucrative commissions or reinsurance fees, or other consideration.<footnote ref="108">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g., The Need for National Mortgage Servicing Standards: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Hous., Transp., &amp;amp; Comm.

Services, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Public Hearings on Force-Placed Insurance&lt;/em&gt; (2012) (statement of Alexis Iwanisziw, Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project) (testifying that problems like mortgage servicers imposing force-placed insurance when homeowners have voluntary market policies persist because mortgage servicers receive commissions, reinsurance contracts, free insurance tracking and other kickbacks when they purchase force-placed insurance); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see further,&lt;/em&gt; Compl., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;United States of America&lt;/em&gt; et al v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; et al at &amp;#182; 51 (alleging that the defendant servicers engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the discharge of their loan servicing activities by imposing force-placed insurance without properly notifying the borrowers and when borrowers already had adequate coverage) (filed on March 14, 2012).</footnote>
            In some cases, consumer groups have asserted that the higher cost of force-placed insurance can drive borrowers, particularly those already facing financial hardship, into default.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, RESPA is a remedial consumer protection statute and imposes obligations upon the servicing of federally related mortgage loans that are intended to protect borrowers. The Bureau believes that the obligations the Dodd-Frank Act established with respect to servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance were intended to impose, at minimum, (1) a duty to help borrowers avoid unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance through both direct limitations on certain charges and several procedural safeguards; and (2) a duty to provide borrowers with reasonably accurate information about servicers' grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance and the financial impact that such purchase could have on the borrowers, in order to encourage borrowers to take appropriate steps to maintain their hazard insurance policies.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>38(a) Reasonable Policies and Procedures</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(a)(1) would have required servicers to establish reasonable policies and procedures for achieving certain objectives relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts. Proposed § 1024.38(a)(1) provided that a servicer meets this requirement if the servicer's policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve certain objectives, which are set forth in proposed § 1024.38(b), and are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with certain specific requirements in proposed § 1024.38(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 38(a)-1 would have clarified that the proposed rule permits servicers to determine the specific methods by which they will implement reasonable policies and procedures to achieve the required objectives. The proposed comment also explained that servicers have flexibility to design the operations that are reasonable in light of the size, nature, and scope of the servicer's operations, including, for example, the volume and aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced, the credit quality, including the default risk, of the mortgage loans serviced, and the servicer's history of consumer complaints. The Bureau noted in the proposal that it intended that this clarification would provide servicers flexibility to design policies and procedures that are appropriate for their servicing businesses.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a handful of comments on the structure of the requirements. Industry commenters, especially credit unions, were generally supportive of framing the requirements as objectives-based standards. A trade association expressed support for the flexibility included in the rule, but noted concern that examiners may not view servicers' programs flexibly and instead may ask servicers to change existing programs based on unpublished rules. A consumer group commented that framing the requirements as objectives-based standards would lead to inconsistent practices throughout the mortgage servicing industry.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(a), which is re-numbered from proposed § 1024.38(a)(1), as proposed with non-substantive modifications. The Bureau believes that, due to diversity of servicer size, infrastructure, and work practices, flexible objectives-based standards are best-suited to manage servicers' operational practices. The Bureau understands as the commenters suggest that framing the requirements as objectives-based standards will lead to differences between how servicers implement the objectives, but believes that objectives-based standards best balance the burden on the industry with the protections for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 38(a)-1, as proposed with non-substantive modifications to explain that a servicer may determine the specific policies and procedures it will adopt and the methods by which it will implement those policies and procedures so long as they are reasonably designed to achieve the objectives set forth in § 1024.38(b). A servicer has flexibility to determine such policies and procedures and methods in light of the size, nature, and scope of the servicer's operations, including, for example, the volume and aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced, the credit quality, including the default risk, of the mortgage loans serviced, and the servicer's history of consumer complaints. Comment 38(a)-1 clarifies that servicers may retain existing procedures or design policies and procedures that are appropriately tailored to their operations, as long as the procedures are reasonably designed to achieve the important objectives set forth in § 1024.38(b). The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(a)-2 to clarify the meaning of the term procedures. As stated in the comment, the term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a servicer for achieving the objectives set forth in § 1024.38(b). This comment clarifies that the Bureau expects that servicers' policies and procedures will be reasonably designed to measure their ability to achieve the objectives set forth in § 1024.38 and to make ongoing improvements to their policies and procedures to address any deficiencies.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Safe harbor.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau proposed § 1024.38(a)(2) to provide a safe harbor for servicers for non-systemic violations of § 1024.38 to manage the costs that would arise from the contemplated litigation risk created by the contemplated civil liability for violations of § 1024.38. Proposed § 1024.38(a)(2) stated that a servicer satisfies the requirement in proposed § 1024.38(a)(1) if the servicer does not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to achieve any of the objectives set forth in proposed § 1024.38(b) and did not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to comply with any of the standard requirements in proposed § 1024.38(c). Proposed comment 38(a)(1)-1 would have provided examples of potential pattern or practice failures by servicers. Proposed comment 38(a)(2)-1 would have provided further clarification about the operation of the safe harbor.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comments received by the Bureau expressed uniform dissatisfaction with the proposed safe harbor definition. Industry commenters in general expressed the concern that the proposed safe harbor would not sufficiently insulate them from the large costs that they said that they would bear due to the litigation risk they saw embedded in the proposal as a result of civil liability, as discussed above in the section-by-section discussion of the legal authority for § 1024.38. In addition, some industry commenters stated that the safe harbor provision, which is based on the lack of a pattern or practice, would lead to costly discovery because servicers would be required to produce large volumes of documents to establish the absence of a pattern or practice.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also expressed opposition to the proposed safe harbor. They commented that the safe harbor definition would make it difficult for borrowers to bring successful civil suits, and urged the Bureau to eliminate or to revise the safe harbor to provide relief for more borrowers. Consumer advocates argued that borrowers need strong protections because borrowers cannot select their servicers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is adopting final general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements that are not enforceable through a private right of action. As violations of this § 1024.38 no longer carry potential civil liability, the Bureau does not believe that the proposed safe harbor is appropriate to include in the final rule. The Bureau is adopting a final rule that does not include proposed § 1024.38(a)(2) or proposed comments 38(a)(1)-1 and 38(a)(2)-1. This revision will also allow the Bureau to protect borrowers through robust supervision and enforcement of the servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in § 1024.38 without having to demonstrate a pattern or practice of violations.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) would have required that a servicer's policies and procedures be reasonably designed to achieve the objective of enabling the servicer to investigate, respond to, and, as appropriate, correct errors asserted by borrowers, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.35, including errors resulting from actions of service providers. A servicer's ability to investigate promptly and respond appropriately to an assertion of error is necessarily dependent upon the accuracy of the servicer's records and on the ability of the servicer's employees to access those records readily. As a result, the Bureau believed that including this objective as one of the objectives for a servicer's policies and procedures was an important supplement to the Dodd-Frank Act error resolution requirements that are implemented in § 1024.35.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received one comment on proposed § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii). A trade association urged the Bureau to limit the applicability of § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) to errors submitted pursuant to § 1024.35. The Bureau declines to adopt the commenter's suggestion. In light of the Bureau's decision to limit the applicability of § 1024.35 to notices of error submitted in writing, as discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.35, the Bureau has decided to modify proposed § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) to clarify that a servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to respond to complaints asserted by borrowers, including those complaints that are not subject to the procedures set forth in § 1024.35. In particular, the Bureau believes that the modification is necessary and appropriate to ensure that consumers receive prompt and appropriate responses to oral complaints even though such complaints will not trigger the formal processes under § 1024.35.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is removing the reference to the actions of service providers from the text of the rule, and, instead, is adopting new comment 38(b)(1)(ii)-1 to clarify that policies and procedures to comply with § 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) must be reasonably designed to provide for promptly obtaining information from service providers to facilitate achieving the objective of correcting errors resulting from actions of service providers, including obligations arising pursuant to § 1024.35.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau believed that the proposed provision was an important supplement to the Dodd-Frank Act information request requirements that are implemented in § 1024.36 because the maintenance of accurate information regarding mortgage loan accounts is necessary for a servicer to respond to requests for information made by borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments on § 1024.38(b)(1)(iii). However, in light of the Bureau's decision to limit the applicability of § 1024.36 to requests for information submitted in writing, as discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.36, the Bureau has decided to modify proposed § 1024.38(b)(1)(iii) to clarify that a servicer must have policies and procedures to provide a borrower with accurate and timely information and documents in response to the borrower's requests for information with respect to the borrower's mortgage loans, including those requests that are not asserted in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.36. In particular, the Bureau continues to believe that servicers must have the capacity to respond to borrowers' requests for information reported to servicers orally, but the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to allow servicers to design policies and procedures best suited to their operations to achieve this objective. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(1)(iii) with modifications from the proposal to broaden the scope of the objective to include borrower requests for information or documents with respect to the borrower's mortgage loan that are not encompassed by the written information request process set forth in § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(b)(1)(iv)-1 to clarify the information and documents contemplated by this section. Comment 38(b)(1)(iv)-1 provides that the relevant and current information to owners or assignees of mortgage loans includes, among other things, information about a servicer's evaluation of borrowers for loss mitigation options and a servicer's agreements with borrowers on loss mitigation options, including loan modifications. Such information includes, for example, information regarding the date, terms, and features of loan modifications, the components of any capitalized arrears, the amount of any servicer advances, and any assumptions regarding the value of a property used in evaluating any loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to protect borrowers from harms resulting from servicers' failure to submit accurate, current, and compliant documents in foreclosure proceedings. In issuing the proposed rule, the Bureau pointed to findings by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that major servicers demonstrated failures to document and verify, in accordance with applicable law, information relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts in connection with foreclosure proceedings.<footnote ref="117">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Failure to Recover: The State of Hous.

                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on proposed § 1024.38(b)(1)(v). State attorneys general commented that the Bureau should adopt stricter standards to ensure the accuracy and validity of foreclosure documentation, such as the standards included in the recent National Mortgage Settlement. In addition, consumer groups urged the Bureau to require servicers who are initiating a foreclosure to provide documentation to borrowers of the right of the party initiating the action to foreclose, including providing evidence of an enforceable security interest and verification of supporting statements.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments, the Bureau has concluded that the proposed language already appropriately addresses the concerns raised. Section 1024.38(b)(1)(v), as proposed, requires servicers to develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring the accuracy of any documents filed in foreclosure proceedings, which would include affidavits or security instruments, and, therefore, is broad enough to cover the specific documents identified in the National Mortgage Settlement. Specifying particular documents which must be submitted accurately, or regulating the particulars of how documents are prepared and validated by servicers, would be inconsistent with the rule's broad objectives-based standards, which, as discussed above, are designed to provide flexibility for a wide range of servicers to develop policies and procedures that are appropriate to their business and that will achieve the stated objectives. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to adopt a final rule containing the specific details included in the National Mortgage Settlement. The Bureau expects that the court filings of servicers whose operational and information management policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve the objective of § 1024.38(b)(1)(v) will be accurate and authorized by the underlying security documents.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that the information request process defined in proposed § 1024.36 provides borrowers in foreclosure with access to the documentation described by consumer groups. Specifically, § 1024.36, as proposed, requires servicers to provide to borrowers upon their request information about their mortgage loan accounts, including their servicing files, which includes a complete payment history, a copy of their security instrument, collection notes, and other valuable information about their accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to revise the proposed language to provide this protection.

In particular, the Bureau understands that successors in interest may encounter challenges in communicating with mortgage servicers about a deceased borrower's mortgage loan account. The Bureau believes that it is essential that servicers' policies and procedures are reasonably designed to facilitate communication with successors in interest regarding a deceased borrower's mortgage loan accounts. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(1)(vi) to clarify that servicers should maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to, upon notification of the death of a borrower, identify promptly and facilitate communication with the successor in interest of the deceased borrower with respect to the property secured by the deceased borrower's mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau expressed its belief that requiring servicers to have reasonable policies and procedures to maintain and manage information and operations that are designed to enable the servicer to evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options facilitates compliance with proposed § 1024.41. Further, such policies and procedures are likely to protect consumers by requiring servicers to consider, in advance of the potential delinquency of a particular mortgage loan, the loss mitigation options that are generally available to borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>While acknowledging that servicers generally have begun to alter the manner in which they invest in infrastructure and are changing their approach to default management, the Bureau stated in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal that it believes that a requirement to develop reasonable policies and procedures to enable a servicer to evaluate loss mitigation applications imposes a reasonable burden on servicers that will benefit delinquent borrowers once the rule takes effect and will protect borrowers in future years as servicers transition from reacting to the current financial crisis to a more steady market more likely to be punctuated by regional spikes in delinquencies and foreclosures. Absent regulation, servicers that have not yet invested in improving loss mitigation functions may find less incentive to do so as housing markets recover, leading to continued inadequate infrastructure during future regional or national housing downturns, which may lead to future borrower harm. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether the Bureau had identified the appropriate objectives with respect to proposed § 1024.38(b)(2) and whether objectives should be removed, or other objectives included, in the requirements.</analysisParagraph>

          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a small number of comments on § 1024.38(b)(2). Consumer advocates supported proposed § 1024.38(b)(2), and urged the Bureau to specify that servicers are required to provide borrowers with a list of available loss mitigation options. Trade associations urged the Bureau to clarify servicers' obligations in this section, in particular whether servicers could limit the information provided to borrowers to only the loss mitigation programs that the servicer offers. The Bureau also received many comments about the servicers' obligations to offer loss mitigation options to borrowers, which are discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting §§ 1024.38(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iv), as proposed with slight modifications for clarification. Section 1024.38(b)(2)(ii) clarifies that the rule envisions that servicers will develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify with specificity all loss mitigation options available for mortgage loans currently serviced by a mortgage servicer and that the mortgage servicer may service in the future. The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(b)(2)(ii)-1, which explains that servicers must develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable servicer personnel to identify all loss mitigation options available for mortgage loans currently serviced by the mortgage servicer. For example, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how a servicer specifically identifies, with respect to each owner or assignee, all of the loss mitigation options that the servicer may consider when evaluating any borrower for a loss mitigation option and the criteria that should be applied by a servicer when evaluating a borrower for such options. In addition, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how the servicer will apply any specific thresholds for eligibility for a particular loss mitigation option established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> if the owner or assignee requires that a servicer only make a particular loss mitigation option available to a certain percentage of the loans that the servicer services for that owner or assignee, then the servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to determine in advance how the servicer will apply that threshold to those mortgage loans). A servicer's policies and procedures must also be reasonably designed to ensure that such information is readily accessible to the servicer personnel involved with loss mitigation, including personnel made available to the borrower as described in § 1024.40.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To meet the objectives of § 1024.38(b)(2)(ii), a servicer will have to establish policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to provide servicer personnel with the ability to determine, on a loan by loan basis, which loss mitigation options made available by the servicer are available to particular borrowers and to provide that information to such borrowers. This objective requires that servicers have access to accurate information about the available loss mitigation options for particular types of loans. The Bureau anticipates that for servicers that service mortgage loans held by the servicer or an affiliate in portfolio, providing access to the latter category of information will not present significant burdens with respect to such mortgage loans as any such policies likely will be uniformly set forth by the servicer or affiliate. Similarly, the Bureau anticipates that servicers that service mortgage loans that are included in securitizations guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae, or insured by FHA or other government sponsored insurance programs, will be familiar with policies that will be set forth by those entities regarding the requirements for loss mitigation options and will be able to make that information available to servicer personnel and borrowers. Servicers that service mortgage loans that are securitized through private label securities may need to undertake more detailed discussions with investors to identify which, if any, loss mitigation programs made available by the servicer are available to borrowers whose mortgage loans are owned by the securitization trust pursuant to the terms of any particular servicing agreement. However, the Bureau believes the burden is still reasonable and will abate over time as the industry does a better job of clarifying such issues at the time that the servicing agreements are first drafted.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the final rule will increase protection for borrowers by requiring servicers to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers consider, in advance of the potential delinquency of a particular mortgage loan, the loss mitigation options that are generally available to borrowers. Further, the final rule provides a basis for Bureau supervision and enforcement regarding whether servicers are unjustifiably asserting investor limitations as a basis for avoiding the work of processing loss mitigation applications.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Proper evaluation of loss mitigation applications.</em> Proposed § 1024.38(b)(2)(v) would have defined as an objective of a servicer's policies and procedures, the proper evaluation of loss mitigation applications, and any appeals, pursuant to the requirements of proposed § 1024.41. As explained in the proposal, borrowers who are struggling to pay their mortgage have a vital interest in being properly considered for all available loss mitigation options, and the ability of servicers to do so is largely dependent upon servicers establishing and implementing policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assure that servicer personnel have prompt and complete access to all relevant information, including documents and information submitted by the borrowers. Proposed § 1024.41, as discussed below, in turn defined procedures for evaluating loss mitigation applications.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Most of the comments received by the Bureau regarding proposed § 1024.38(b)(2)(v) focused on the procedures set forth in proposed § 1024.41. However, in light of the comments received, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(2)(v), with modifications from the proposal to make clear that the objective of proper evaluation of a borrower's application for a loss mitigation option, or any appeal, extends to all loss mitigation options that are potentially available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. As explained below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.41, this objective is not inconsistent with the use of a waterfall of loss mitigation options that an investor or assignee may establish.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(b)(2)(v)-1 to clarify that a servicer is required pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(v) to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option consistent with any owner or assignee requirements, even where the requirements of § 1024.41 may be inapplicable. For example, an owner or assignee may require that a servicer implement certain procedures to review a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower less than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. Further, an owner or assignee may require that a servicer implement certain procedures to re-evaluate a borrower who has demonstrated a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances for a loss mitigation option after the servicer's initial evaluation. A servicer must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement these requirements even if such loss mitigation evaluations may not be required pursuant to § 1024.41. The Bureau believes that the final rule will provide borrowers with greater access to loss mitigation options and more transparency into the evaluation process.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(b)(3) would have required that a servicer's policies and procedures be reasonably designed to achieve the objective of enabling the servicer to provide appropriate servicer personnel with accurate and current information reflecting actions performed by service providers, facilitating periodic reviews of service providers, and facilitating the sharing of accurate and current information among servicer personnel and service providers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau explained that proposed § 1024.38(b)(3) was designed to address recent evaluations of mortgage servicer practices that had found that some major servicers “did not properly structure, carefully conduct, or prudently manage their third-party vendor relationships.”<footnote ref="119">Fed.

            For example, certain servicers supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were found by those agencies to have failed to monitor third-party vendor foreclosure law firms' compliance with the servicer's standards or to retain copies of documents maintained by third-party law firms.<footnote ref="120">Fed. Reserve Sys., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, &amp; Office of Thrift Supervision, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices&lt;/em&gt; 9 (2011).</footnote>

            The Bureau noted in the proposal that these failures likely resulted in significant harms for borrowers, including imposing unwarranted fees on borrowers and harms relating to so-called “dual tracking” from miscommunications between service providers and servicer loss mitigation personnel.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment regarding whether the Bureau had identified the appropriate objectives and whether objectives should be removed, or other objectives included, in the requirements. The Bureau received a small number of comments proposed § 1024.38(b)(3), all of which were submitted by industry. Commenters sought clarification about the scope of proposed § 1024.38(b)(3), including whether the provision would apply to vendors used for non-mortgage loan related tasks and whether the provision would create an independent obligation for service providers to comply with § 1024.38. Servicers also sought guidance on how to comply with the periodic review requirements of proposed § 1024.38(b)(3)(ii), including whether compliance with the recent National Mortgage Settlement or participation in shared assessment programs would satisfy a servicer's obligations under the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(b)(3) would have imposed obligations on servicers with respect to maintaining and providing access to information about service providers, as defined by § 1024.31, discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of that section, which includes any party retained by a servicer that interacts with a borrower or provides a service to a servicer for which a borrower may incur a fee. The proposed provision would therefore not have created obligations with respect to vendors who do not meet this definition.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(3), as proposed. The Bureau remains concerned about servicers' inadequate oversight of service providers, and believes that proposed § 1024.38(b)(3) appropriately addresses this concern by requiring servicers to maintain reasonable policies and procedures, which will provide servicer personnel with information about actions of service providers and facilitate review of service providers. The Bureau expects that servicers seeking to demonstrate that their policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve these objectives will demonstrate that, in fact, the servicer has been able to use its information to oversee its service providers effectively, such as through a shared assessment program of the type set forth in the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>38(b)(4) Facilitating Transfer of Information During Servicing Transfers</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(b)(4) would have required that a servicer's policies and procedures be reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring the timely transfer of all information and documents relating to a transferred mortgage loan to a transferee servicer in a form and manner that enables the transferee servicer to comply with the requirements of subpart C and the terms of the transferee servicer's contractual obligations to owners or assignees of the mortgage loans. Further, proposed § 1024.38(b)(4) would have provided an objective that a transferee servicer shall have documents and information regarding the status of discussions with a borrower regarding loss mitigation options, any agreements with a borrower for a loss mitigation option, and any analysis with respect to potential recovery from a non-performing mortgage loan, as appropriate (typically called a final recovery determination).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In proposing § 1024.38(b)(4), the Bureau expressed concern that servicing transfers could give rise to potential harms to consumers. Transferee servicers may experience problems relating to inaccurate transfer of past payment information, failures of the transferor servicer to transfer documents provided to it by a borrower or others, and inaccurate transfer of information relating to loss mitigation discussions with borrowers. Borrowers engaged in loss mitigation efforts may be transferred to transferee servicers that have no knowledge of the existence or status of the loss mitigation efforts.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau explained in the proposal that it believed it is a typical servicer duty for servicers to be able to effectuate sales, assignments, and transfers of mortgage servicing in a manner that does not adversely impact borrowers. Servicers generally should expect that servicing may be sold, assigned, or transferred for certain loans they service. Servicers may owe a duty to investors to ensure that mortgage servicing can be transferred without adversely impacting the value of the investor's asset. The Bureau stated that it believes it is appropriate for servicers to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring that in the event of any such transfer, documents and information regarding mortgage loan accounts are identified and transferred to a transferee servicer in a manner that permits the transferee servicer to continue providing appropriate service to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comments regarding whether the Bureau had identified the appropriate objectives and whether objectives should be removed, or other objectives included, in the requirements. The Bureau received a small number of comments on proposed § 1024.38(b)(4). Consumer advocates and some industry expressed support for the proposal. Other commenters asked for clarification about what the proposal would require, including whether transferor servicers must transfer all of the servicing file elements and whether the rule would require transferor servicers to obtain documents outside of the transferor servicers' possession or control. Servicers also asked for clarification about whether the rule would allow servicers to transfer files electronically.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has received information that consumers often face difficulty enforcing a loss mitigation agreement reached with a transferor servicer prior to transfer with the transferee servicer. The Bureau has learned that transferee servicers often fail to request complete information about loss mitigation agreements from transferor servicers, and instead require borrowers to provide that documentation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(b)(4)(i), renumbered from proposed § 1024.38(b)(4), with modifications to address those comments. The Bureau has revised the proposal to add language to clarify that a transferor servicer's objectives regarding facilitating transfer relate only to documents within the transferor servicer's possession or control and that the transfer of information and documents must be in a form and manner that enables a transferee servicer to comply with obligations both under the terms of the mortgage loan and with applicable law. The Bureau is also removing the language concerning the transfer of information regarding loss mitigation discussions with borrowers from the text of proposed § 1024.38(b)(4) and, instead, is including new comment 38(b)(4)(i)-2, which clarifies the transferor servicer's obligation under § 1024.38(b)(4)(i) to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the transfer includes any information reflecting the current status of discussions with a borrower regarding loss mitigation options, any agreements entered into with a borrower on a loss mitigation option, and any analysis by a servicer with respect to potential recovery from a non-performing mortgage loan, as appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To address industry's comments about the manner in which transferor servicers may effectuate the transfer of documents and information, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(4)(i)-1, which clarifies that a transferor servicer's policies and procedures may provide for transferring documents and information electronically provided that the transfer is conducted in a manner that is reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy of the information and documents transferred and that enables a transferee servicer to comply with its obligations to the owner or assignee of the loan and with applicable law. For example, transferor servicers must have policies and procedures for ensuring that data can be properly and promptly boarded by a transferee servicer's electronic systems and that all necessary documents and information are available to, and can be appropriately identified by, a transferee servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting § 1024.38(b)(4)(ii) to more clearly define objectives for transferee servicers. Section 1024.38(b)(4)(ii) defines as an objective of a transferee servicer's reasonable policies and procedures identifying necessary documents or information that may not have been transferred by a transferor servicer and obtaining such documents from the transferor servicer. Comment 38(b)(4)(ii)-1 explains that a transferee servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure, in connection with a servicing transfer, that the servicer receives information regarding any loss mitigation discussions with a borrower, including any copies of loss mitigation agreements.

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.38(c)(1) would have required a servicer to retain records that document actions taken with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account until one year after a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer. When issuing the proposed rule, the Bureau observed that proposed §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 would have required servicers to respond to notices of error and information requests provided up to one year after a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer. The Bureau also noted that it believes that the record retention requirement was necessary for servicer compliance with obligations set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36. The Bureau also proposed to eliminate the systems of record keeping set forth in current § 1024.17(<em data-original="E-03">l</em>), which required servicers to retain copies of documents related to borrower's escrow accounts for five years after the servicer last serviced the escrow account, which is likely to be close in time to when a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer. Further, the Bureau observed that servicers will require accurate information for the life of the mortgage loan to provide accurate payoff balances to borrowers or to exercise a right to foreclose. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether servicers should be required to retain documents and information relating to a mortgage file until one year after a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer and the potential burden of this requirement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a handful of comments on proposed § 1024.38(c)(1). Consumer advocates urged the Bureau to extend the retention period from one year to five years to ensure that documents were available for discovery in civil litigation. Two servicers argued that the one year retention period would impose too great a cost on servicers. Another servicer commented that it agreed with the proposed one year retention period. A trade association also urged the Bureau to clarify that contractual rights to access records possessed by another entity would satisfy the servicer's requirements under this provision.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(c)(1), as proposed. The Bureau believes that servicers should retain records that document actions taken by the servicer with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account until one year after the date the mortgage loan is discharged or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred by the servicer to a transferee servicer. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the record retention requirement is necessary for servicer compliance with obligations set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36. Further, the Bureau believes that servicers require accurate information for the life of the mortgage loan to provide accurate payoff balances to borrowers or to exercise a right to foreclose. Requiring servicers to retain records until one year after the transfer or payoff of a mortgage loan may impose some marginal increase in the servicer's compliance burden in the form of incremental storage costs, but the Bureau believes that this burden is reasonable in light of the considerable benefits to borrowers. Moreover, the retention period is necessary to ensure that the Bureau and other regulators have an opportunity to supervise servicers' compliance with applicable laws effectively. The Bureau declines to adopt the longer period suggested by commenters.

                <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that many large servicers maintained documents and information related to a borrower's mortgage loan account in disparate systems and that this practice has led servicers to have difficulty identifying all necessary information regarding a borrower's mortgage loan account, including collector's notes, payment histories, note and deed of trust documents, and account debit and credit information, including escrow account information.

                <analysisParagraph>The majority of the comments on proposed § 1024.38(c)(2) came from industry, and demonstrated confusion about the proposed provision. Industry commenters generally misunderstood the proposed provision as a requirement to provide borrowers with copies of their servicing files not subject to the procedures for information requests set forth in § 1024.36. Some servicers explicitly urged the Bureau to subject requests for servicing files to the procedural requirements of the information requests defined in § 1024.36. In addition, given this misunderstanding, industry comments urged the Bureau to adopt limits on borrowers' requests for servicing files to protect servicers from burdensome or duplicative requests. Servicers also suggested that the Bureau eliminate certain elements of the servicing file, such as payment histories, collection notes, and data fields, because they claimed that those elements would be too voluminous to provide to borrowers. A large servicer also urged the Bureau to allow flexibility in how servicers provide the information to borrowers, such as allowing borrowers to access the servicing file via a Web site.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Servicers also expressed concern that the proposed provision might require them to disclose privileged or proprietary information to borrowers. In particular, many commenters pointed to collection notes and data fields as elements potentially containing privileged or proprietary information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some comments also focused on a perceived litigation risk from providing copies of the servicing file to borrowers. Two comments cautioned that borrowers and their attorneys could use the request for the servicing file to obtain information normally only available to borrowers through court-ordered discovery in litigation. Commenters also stated that collection notes and data fields were created for strictly internal purposes, and would confuse borrowers, which might lead to litigation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups expressed support for providing borrowers with copies of their servicing files upon request. Consumer advocates noted that they specifically supported providing borrowers with a copy of a record of all payments credited to the account upon request and the data fields identifying the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan account. Also, one consumer advocate noted that the schedule of payments should include all payments made during the life of the loan and not just payments made to the current servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To address the commenters' confusion about the relationship between proposed §§ 1024.38(c)(2) and 1024.36, the Bureau has removed the requirement to provide borrowers with copies of their servicing file from the language of proposed § 1024.38(c)(2). Instead, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(c)(2)-2 that clarifies that § 1024.38(c)(2) does not confer upon any borrower an independent right to access information contained in the servicing file and that upon receipt of a borrower's request for a servicing file, a servicer shall provide the borrower with a copy of the information contained in the servicing file for the borrower's mortgage loan, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in § 1024.36. This revision does not alter the substance of proposed § 1024.38(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Aggregation of servicing file.</em> Proposed § 1024.38(c)(2) would have required that servicers provide a defined set of information and data, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> a serving file, to borrowers upon request. Commenters interpreted this provision to require that servicers aggregate the elements of the servicing file defined in this section into a single file or information management system. Industry commenters, especially community banks, and credit unions, expressed concern about the potential implementation burden of aggregating the information regarding each borrower into a single system. Some of these commenters explained that their existing information systems stored some of the elements of the servicing file in separate systems. Some of these commenters also stated that their existing systems had not led to problems identified in the proposal, and urged the Bureau not to mandate that servicers with sound existing information management systems rebuild those systems to satisfy the technical details in the regulation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The intent of the servicing file requirement in proposed § 1024.38(c)(2) was to prevent harm to borrowers and to investors by requiring servicers to have the capacity to access key information about a mortgage loan quickly. However, the Bureau recognizes that there are multiple ways to achieve this objective. The Bureau also does not want needlessly to require servicers with existing systems that work well to dismantle those systems by adopting an overly prescriptive regulatory framework. In light of the comments that the Bureau received, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38(c)(2) with modifications to allow flexibility for the manner in which a servicer maintains a servicing file. Under the final rule, § 1024.38(c)(2) requires servicers to maintain a specific defined set of documents and data on each mortgage loan account serviced by the servicer in a manner that facilitates compiling such documents and data into a servicing file within five days. The Bureau believes that the final rule appropriately balances the benefits to borrowers and to investors by ensuring that servicers have ready access to all of the information necessary to service mortgage loan accounts with the flexibility required to enable servicers to design information management systems that correspond to the servicers' existing information management practices.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Content of servicing file.</em> Proposed § 1024.38(c)(2) would have required servicers to create a single servicing file for each mortgage loan account containing, (i) a schedule of all payments credited or debited to the mortgage loan account, including any escrow account as defined in § 1024.17(b) and any suspense account; (ii) a copy of the borrower's security instrument; (iii) any collection notes created by servicer personnel reflecting communications with borrowers about the mortgage loan account; (iv) a report of any data fields relating to a borrower's mortgage loan account created by a servicer's electronic systems in connection with collection practices, including records of automatically or manually dialed telephonic communications; and (v) copies of any information or documents provided by a borrower to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 or 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments on this aspect of the proposal. Consumer advocates highlighted their support for the requirement that servicers maintain a servicing file that includes a copy of the security instrument and the complete payment history. Some servicers commented that the Bureau should limit the payment history requirement due to the costs associated with maintaining a payment history for the life of the mortgage loan, especially with respect to partial payments. A large servicer urged the Bureau to delay implementation of this proposed provision to allow the Bureau to test what fields should be contained in a servicing file. Industry comments also noted that some servicers' existing files do not contain all of the required elements.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some servicers also asked for clarification about the requirements for certain elements of the servicing file. A few servicers also asked for clarification about what type of communications with borrowers must be recorded in the collection notes, and in particular, whether a servicer must record communications with borrowers unrelated to mortgage loans. A few industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify the data fields the servicer must maintain, described in proposed § 1024.38(c)(2)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau believes the interests of borrowers are best served if servicers are quickly able to access certain key information regarding a borrower's mortgage loan account, including a schedule of all transactions credited or debited to the mortgage loan account, including any escrow account as defined in § 1024.17(b) and any suspense account, a copy of the security instrument that establishes the lien securing the mortgage loan, any notes created by servicer personnel reflecting communications with borrowers about the mortgage loan account, data fields as defined by § 1024.38(c)(2)(iv), and copies of any information or documents provided by the borrower to the servicers in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 or 1024.41. Therefore, the Bureau declines to remove any of the proposed elements from the servicing file definition. Also, the flexibility added to the final rule for servicers to determine how best to store the elements of the servicing file reduces the implementation burden on servicers. Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting the elements of the servicing file in § 1024.38(c)(2), with minor technical adjustments, as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To address commenters' confusion about the information described in proposed § 1024.38(c)(iv), the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(c)(2)(iv)-1. Comment 38(c)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that a report of the data fields relating to the borrower's mortgage loan account created by the servicer's electronic systems in connection with servicing practices means a report listing the relevant data fields by name, populated with any specific data relating to the borrower's mortgage loan account. Comment 38(c)(2)(iv)-1 also provides examples of data fields relating to a borrower's mortgage loan account created by the servicer's electronic systems in connection with servicing practices including fields used to identify the terms of the borrower's mortgage loan, fields used to identify the occurrence of automated or manual collection calls, fields reflecting the evaluation of a borrower for a loss mitigation option, fields used to identify the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, and any credit reporting history. Also, § 1024.38(c)(2)(iii) only requires servicers to maintain any notes created by servicer personnel reflecting communications with a borrower about the mortgage loan account.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is adopting comment 38(c)(2)-1 to address commenters' confusion about the applicability of the servicing file requirements to existing servicer documents and information. Comment 38(c)(2)-1 explains that a servicer complies with § 1024.38(c)(2) if it maintains information in a manner that facilitates compliance with § 1024.38(c)(2) beginning on or after January 10, 2014. A servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.38(c)(2) with respect to information created prior to January 10, 2014.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1024.38 General Servicing Policies, Procedures, and Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Background.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau proposed rules that would amend Regulation X to implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA and RESPA, with respect to among other things, error resolution and information requests. The Bureau also proposed to use its section 19(a) authority to require servicers to establish and to implement reasonable policies and procedures to manage information and documents, to evaluate and respond to loss mitigation applications, and to achieve other important objectives.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As described more fully above, the Bureau's proposal sought to address pervasive consumer protection problems across major segments of the mortgage servicing industry that came to light during the recent financial crisis and that underlie many consumer complaints and recent regulatory and enforcement actions. In the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau stated that it believed that many servicers simply had not made the investments in resources and infrastructure necessary to service large numbers of delinquent loans. The Bureau noted that recent evaluations of mortgage servicer practices have indicated that borrowers have been harmed as a result of many servicers' lacking adequate policies and procedures to provide servicer personnel with appropriate borrower information. Federal regulatory agencies reviewing mortgage servicing practices have found that certain servicers demonstrated “significant weaknesses in risk-management, quality control, audit, and compliance practices.”<footnote ref="115">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Problems in Mortg.

            <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau noted that major servicers demonstrated systemic failures to document and verify, in accordance with applicable law, information relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts in connection with foreclosure proceedings. Examinations by prudential regulators found “critical deficiencies in foreclosure governance processes, document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third parties * * * [a]ll servicers [examined] exhibited similar deficiencies, although the number, nature, and severity of deficiencies varied by servicer.”<footnote ref="116">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Failure to Recover: The State of Hous.

          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau explained in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, a servicer's obligation to maintain accurate and timely information regarding a mortgage loan account and to be able to provide accurate and timely information to its own employees and to borrowers, owners, assignees, subsequent servicers, and courts, among others, is one of the most basic servicer duties. A servicer cannot comply with its myriad obligations to investors and applicable law, unless it maintains sound systems to manage the servicing of mortgage loan accounts, including information systems that maintain accurate and timely information with respect to mortgage loan accounts. To address those critical concerns, the Bureau decided to use RESPA section 19(a) authority to propose a rule to address servicers' information management and other general servicing policies and procedures across the industry.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received general comments about whether it was appropriate for the Bureau to regulate servicers' practices related to information management and other servicer policies and procedures identified in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal. Consumer group comments generally demonstrated support for the proposal. Industry comments, on the other hand, expressed skepticism about whether it is necessary for the Bureau to regulate servicers' information management and other operational practices. Some industry comments suggested that recent State and Federal remediation efforts, such as the National Mortgage Settlement, and other existing regulations obviated the need for any regulation by the Bureau. Some servicers also urged the Bureau to delay adopting the proposed rule. The Bureau also received a small number of comments about the scope of the rule, including whether the proposed rule would apply to mortgages other than federally regulated mortgages or to reverse mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of the potential harm to borrowers due to the deficiencies in servicer practices highlighted in the proposal, the Bureau continues to believe that servicers should achieve certain critical general servicing objectives and requirements. The Bureau declines to adopt the commenters' suggestions that regulation of these practices is not necessary at this time, and is adopting § 1024.38, as proposed with the modifications discussed in detail below. Through enforcement and supervision of § 1024.38, the Bureau will evaluate whether servicers are achieving the objectives and requirements set forth in § 1024.38. The Bureau also expects that servicers will measure their own ability to achieve the objectives and requirements set forth in § 1024.38. In addition, the Bureau expects that servicers' policies and procedures will address the core functions that they need to achieve those objectives and requirements, including providing adequate staffing and meaningful oversight of the resources engaged in achieving those important objectives and requirements, including servicer staff, service providers, and vendors.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As explained above, the Bureau believes that the general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in § 1024.38 are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protective purposes of RESPA, including to avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, to ensure that servicers are responsive to consumer requests and complaints, to ensure that servicers provide and maintain accurate and relevant information about the mortgage loan accounts that they service, and to facilitate the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Moreover, as discussed in detail below in part VII, the Bureau believes that the burden imposed on servicers under the final rule is reasonable in light of the countervailing benefits of the provisions.
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30, § 1024.38 applies only to the servicing of federally related mortgage loans, as defined in § 1024.2, and does not apply to the servicing of reverse mortgages, as defined in § 1024.31, or with respect to any mortgage loan for which a servicer is subject to regulation by the Farm Credit Administration as a “qualified lender,” as defined in 12 CFR 617.7000. In addition, § 1024.38 does not apply to small servicers, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4). The Bureau has also modified the final rule to clarify that the policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in § 1024.38 are broader than information management and encompass general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Legal Authority</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In proposing § 1024.38, the Bureau relied on a number of authorities, including section 6(k)(1)(E) of RESPA. That provision, which was added by § 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act as part of a broader set of servicing-related requirements, authorizes the Bureau to promulgate regulations “appropriate to carry out the consumer protection purposes of [RESPA].” In the proposal, the Bureau noted that § 1024.38 was further authorized under section 6(j)(3) of RESPA, as necessary to carry out section 6 of RESPA, and under section 19(a) of RESPA, as necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. Because rules issued under section 6 of RESPA, including under sections 6(k)(1) and 6(j)(3), are enforceable through private rights of action, the Bureau proposed § 1024.38(a)(2), which set forth a safe harbor under which a servicer would not violate proposed § 1024.38 unless it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to achieve any of the objectives set forth in § 1024.38. The Bureau believed that creating a pattern or practice threshold would significantly improve industry practices but not subject servicers to lawsuits with respect to, for example, a single lost document or filing error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received many comments on the private liability suggested by the Bureau's reliance on its authority under section 6 of RESPA to propose § 1024.38. Numerous industry commenters expressed concern that authorizing § 1024.38 under section 6 of RESPA would create a private cause of action to enforce the provisions of the section. These commenters noted that the litigation risk created by the proposed rule would complicate compliance due to the potential for inconsistent judicial interpretations of the rule. In light of this concern, industry commenters asked the Bureau to provide detailed, specific guidance on how to comply with the objectives set forth in proposed § 1024.38. In addition, servicers argued that the Bureau and prudential regulators are better positioned to assess and supervise servicers' internal policies and procedures than courts through civil litigation. Industry commenters also stressed that the private litigation that would likely ensue under proposed § 1024.38 would increase the cost of servicing and thereby decrease the availability of credit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters generally supported the allowance of private rights of action to enforce § 1024.38 but expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed safe harbor, which they argued should be eliminated or revised to reduce the barriers to successful civil actions and to ensure sufficient protection for borrowers. They commented that the safe harbor definition would make it difficult for consumers to bring successful civil suits, and urged the Bureau to eliminate or to revise the safe harbor to provide relief for more borrowers. Consumer advocates argued that borrowers need strong protections because borrowers cannot select their servicers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, the Bureau is concerned that a servicer's failure to achieve each of the objectives and standard requirements set forth in § 1024.38 creates the potential for adverse consequences harmful to borrowers. These may include imposing improper fees on borrowers, inability reasonably to evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options that may benefit borrowers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans, unwarranted costs to borrowers, and the potential for fraud upon courts through inaccurate or unverifiable legal pleadings.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought to balance the need for consumer protections with the costs created by command-and-control regulation by proposing objectives-based policies and procedures that allowed servicers flexibility to set policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain defined objectives. Because a single failure to achieve a desired objective or requirement is not necessarily indicative of a servicer's failure to implement appropriate policies and procedures and in light of the potential costs of civil litigation, the Bureau proposed a safe harbor under which servicers would be liable only for systemic violations of § 1024.38. Upon consideration of the comments and further consideration, however, the Bureau has concluded that the proposed formulation would not have adequately balanced the countervailing concerns of borrowers and industry. Requiring a showing of a pattern or practice could make it difficult for borrowers or regulators to obtain remedies until a servicer had inflicted widespread harm among its borrowers. At the same time, the prospect that many individual suits could be filed could threaten to undermine the basic goal of an objectives-based system, if servicers felt pressured to adopt models to reduce risk that were not in fact appropriately tailored to their particular operations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Ultimately, the Bureau agrees with the commenters that allowing a private right of action for the provisions that set forth general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements would create significant litigation risk. As the commenters noted, courts potentially would interpret the proposed flexible objectives-based standards inconsistently, which would have created compliance challenges for servicers. To address such challenges, the Bureau believes that it would have needed to issue more prescriptive standards in the final rule. The Bureau continues to believe, however, for the reasons discussed above, that flexible objectives-based standards are best suited to address the information management and other servicing challenges faced by different servicers that the Bureau identified in the proposal. Policies and procedures best suited to achieve the desired objectives are often highly dependent on the facts and circumstances of an individual servicer, such as the number and type of loans being serviced, and the technology that the servicer has deployed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that supervision and enforcement by the Bureau and other Federal regulators for compliance with and violations of § 1024.38 respectively, would provide robust consumer protection without subjecting servicers to the same litigation risk and concomitant compliance costs as civil liability for asserted violations of § 1024.38. Indeed, the Bureau believes that the Bureau and other Federal regulators have the experience and judgment necessary to evaluate a servicer's compliance with § 1024.38 and to take action against servicers whose operational systems are not reasonably designed to achieve the stated objectives without waiting for evidence of a pattern or practice of undesirable outcomes. Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there was no comprehensive Federal supervisory authority over non-bank mortgage servicers. The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive regime of federal regulation over both bank and non-bank mortgage servicers. Under this new regime, the Bureau and other federal regulators can calibrate supervision to focus on practices that present the greatest risk to borrowers and work with servicers to assure that servicers have implemented effective systems that protect consumers and manage servicing portfolios. At the same time, the new comprehensive regulatory regime will allow the Bureau and other regulators to take prompt and effective action where a servicer's policies and procedures are deficient without waiting for proof of a pattern or practice of abuse.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is restructuring the final rule so that it neither provides private liability for violations of § 1024.38 nor contains a safe harbor limiting liability to situations where there is a pattern or practice of violations. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has also revised some of the proposed objectives and added new requirements that the Bureau believes can be appropriately overseen by supervisory agencies but that would have been difficult for the courts to administer on a case-by-case basis. The Bureau believes that this approach more appropriately balances the need for robust consumer protections with respect to the general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in § 1024.38 through supervision and enforcement by the Bureau and other agencies with the flexibility for industry to define how to achieve the important objectives set forth in § 1024.38.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau no longer relies on its authorities under section 6 of RESPA to issue § 1024.38. Instead, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.38 pursuant to its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA. As explained in more detail below, the Bureau believes that the servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in § 1024.38 are necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including to avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, to ensure that servicers are responsive to consumer requests and complaints, to ensure that servicers provide and maintain accurate and relevant information about the mortgage loan accounts that they service, and to facilitate the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. The Bureau believes that without sound operational policies and procedures and without achieving certain standard requirements, servicers will not be able to achieve those purposes. The Bureau is also adopting § 1024.38 pursuant to its authority under section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial laws. Specifically, the Bureau believes that § 1024.38 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objective under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>Proposed § 1024.39(a)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(a) would have required that, if a borrower is late in making a payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow, the servicer must, not later than 30 days after the missed payment, notify or make good faith efforts to notify the borrower that the payment is late and that loss mitigation options, if applicable, may be available. Proposed § 1024.39(a) also provided that if the servicer attempts to notify the borrower by telephone, good faith efforts would require calling the borrower on at least three separate days in order to reach the borrower. The Bureau explained in the section-by-section analysis of the proposed rule that the “if applicable” qualification in proposed § 1024.39(a) meant that servicers that do not make any loss mitigation options available to borrowers would not be required to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau had proposed to clarify through comment 39(a)-1.i that the oral notice would have to be made through live contact or good faith efforts to make live contact with the borrower, such as by telephoning or meeting in-person with the borrower, and that oral contact does not include a recorded message delivered by phone. Proposed comment 39(a)-1.ii would have clarified that a servicer is not required to describe specific loss mitigation options, and that the servicer need only inform the borrower that loss mitigation options may be available, if applicable. The comment also would have clarified that a servicer may provide more detailed information that the servicer believes would be helpful. Proposed comment 39(a)-2 clarified that, in order to make a good faith effort by telephone, the servicer must complete the three phone calls attempting to reach the borrower by the end of the 30-day period after the payment due date.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received significant comment on the proposed oral notice from consumer advocacy groups, trade associations, credit unions, community banks, rural servicers, large banks, non-bank servicers, and individual consumers. Consumer advocacy groups and two residential real estate trade associations were generally supportive of an oral notice requirement. One coalition of consumer advocacy groups explained that a mandatory phone call or visit would alert borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available and give borrowers an opportunity to ask questions and gather accurate information about the borrower's rights and responsibilities. Several consumer advocacy groups and individual consumers supported an oral notice requirement because it would permit borrowers to engage in an interactive conversation with servicers about their rights and responsibilities surrounding loss mitigation. A number of consumer advocacy groups, however, requested that the Bureau require that servicers provide more information about loss mitigation options than the notice set forth in proposed § 1024.39(a). These commenters recommended that servicers notify borrowers of all loss mitigation options that may be available, including application instructions and deadlines, and information about the foreclosure process at the time of the oral notice. Several consumer advocacy groups also recommended that the Bureau delete proposed comment 39(a)-1.ii, which explained that a servicer need not describe specific loss mitigation options during the oral notice and that the servicer need only inform borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available, if applicable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters expressed concern about the circumstances under which servicers would be required to notify borrowers about loss mitigation options. These commenters explained that a servicer's offer of loss mitigation depends on not only the stage of a borrower's delinquency but also the nature of the delinquency, as well as other circumstances, pursuant to investor or guarantor guidelines and could be perceived as misleading for borrowers who are ultimately ineligible based on owner or investor requirements. These commenters, including one Federal agency, also expressed concern that informing borrowers of loss mitigation options that are inappropriate for short-term delinquencies could impede the resolution of delinquent loans by discouraging borrowers from resolving a short-term delinquency they could have cured on their own. Industry commenters also asserted that notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options too early would be confusing or perceived as potentially harassing for those borrowers at low risk of default. In addition, several commenters cited concerns that requiring early intervention for low-risk borrowers would detract from helping high-risk borrowers. To address these concerns, they requested that the Bureau clarify the circumstances under which servicers would be required to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available. In particular, several commenters requested that the Bureau clarify that, before providing the notice regarding loss mitigation options, a servicer may first determine whether a borrower is experiencing a short- or long-term delinquency, and that servicers be permitted to pursue collection efforts in the case of short-term delinquencies.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also expressed concern with demonstrating compliance with the oral notice requirement, particularly in light of the possibility of a private right of action under RESPA section 6, which the Bureau relied on as a source of legal authority for proposed § 1024.39. Rural, community bank, and credit union servicers recommended against an oral notice requirement because such requirements are difficult to track and verify, would require systems reprogramming or upgrades, may be misunderstood by borrowers, and would not guarantee establishing contact with borrowers. One community bank commenter stated that a simple delinquency notice should suffice, without a need to have a live conversation about loss mitigation options. Several rural and credit union servicers indicated that staffing and resource limitations would make it difficult to reach borrowers after normal work hours, when most borrowers are available by phone. One industry commenter recommended that the Bureau mandate in-person outreach in addition to the oral and written notice requirements while another industry commenter asked that the Bureau clarify that this provision does not mandate in-person outreach.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters and individual consumers recommended that other forms of contact, such as text messages or email should be permitted, but not required, to satisfy good faith efforts, or that email should be permitted in lieu of live contact. These commenters noted that a more flexible approach, such as permitting written or other forms of electronic contact, would help reach borrowers and address compliance issues because written methods are more easily tracked. Several industry commenters requested that the Bureau permit servicers to engage in any form of contact that is reasonable under the circumstances. One industry commenter suggested that servicers should be permitted to leave a recorded message instead of three phone calls.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>By contrast, a number of consumer advocacy groups stated that the good faith effort standard as proposed was reasonable, although some recommended that servicers be required to engage in more efforts to contact the borrower, such as by attempting to contact borrowers on every telephone number on record in order to reach the borrower and by requiring that servicers leave a message when servicers have that option. Some consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers be required to leave a message when a borrower's telephone number provided a voicemail option, while an industry commenter indicated there may be privacy concerns with respect to any potential requirement for notices to be provided via text or email.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Final § 1024.39(a)</title>
                <analysisParagraph>After considering comments on the proposal, the Bureau is revising the proposed oral notice requirement into a live contact requirement permits servicers to exercise reasonable discretion in determining whether informing delinquent borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances. The Bureau is also adjusting the timing of the contact requirement from the proposed 30-day timeframe to 36 days.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Under § 1024.39(a), a servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with a delinquent borrower not later than the 36th day of the borrower's delinquency and, promptly after establishing live contact, inform such borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options “if appropriate.” The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-3.i to clarify that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether informing a borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances. To illustrate, comment 39(a)-3.i provides examples demonstrating when a servicer has made a reasonable determination regarding the appropriateness of providing information about loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.i.A illustrates a scenario in which a servicer provides information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower that notifies a servicer during live contact of a material adverse change in the borrower's financial circumstances that is likely to cause the borrower to experience a long-term delinquency for which loss mitigation options may be available. Comment 39(a)-3.i.B illustrates a scenario in which a servicer does not provide information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower who has missed a January 1 payment and notified the servicer that full late payment will be transmitted to the servicer by February 15.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a modified version of the proposed oral notice in § 1024.39(a) because the Bureau agrees that a prescriptive requirement to provide an oral notice for all delinquent borrowers, where loss mitigation options were available, within the first 30 days of a delinquency would be overbroad. The Bureau observes that the oral notice as proposed would not have required servicers to offer options in a manner that is inconsistent with investor or guarantor requirements because servicers would only have had to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options, if applicable, “may” be available; servicers would not have been required to provide information about or offer options that the servicer did not already offer. However, the Bureau recognizes the potential for borrower confusion if servicers are required in every instance to notify borrowers who are experiencing short-term delinquencies of available loss mitigation options if these borrowers ultimately are unlikely to need or be eligible for such options. The Bureau agrees that providing the notice within the first 30 days of a borrower's delinquency may be unwarranted if a borrower would not ultimately qualify based on investor or guarantor requirements or for whom loss mitigation options are unnecessary, such as for borrowers who are experiencing a short-term cash-flow problem. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, borrowers who are 30 days delinquent generally present a lower risk for default, (compared to borrowers with more extended delinquencies), and such borrowers typically resolve their delinquency without the assistance of loss mitigation options.<footnote ref="130">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Amy Crews Cutts &amp;amp; William A. Merrill, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Interventions in Mortgage Default: Policies and Practices to Prevent Home Loss and Lower Costs&lt;/em&gt; 10 (Freddie Mac, Working Paper No. 08-01, 2008) (explaining that, in one study, there was a &amp;#8220;significant cure rate out of the 30-day delinquency population without servicer intervention,&amp;#8221; but that &amp;#8220;as the time in delinquency increases so does the hurdle the borrower has to overcome to reinstate the loan and the importance of calling the servicer&amp;#8221;).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, while many borrowers who miss a payment will be able to self-cure within 30 days, some portion of these borrowers are likely to fall further behind on their payments, and the Bureau believes servicers should make efforts to inform such borrowers that help is available. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, evidence suggests that one of the barriers to communication between borrowers and servicers is that borrowers do not know that servicers may be helpful or that they have options to avoid foreclosure, and that as a result of these barriers, borrowers may not know that help is available until too late, when it can be more difficult to cure a delinquency. Although borrowers may receive notice of loss mitigation options through other written notices, such as the written early intervention notice proposed at § 1024.39(b), borrowers may be reluctant to contact a servicer on their own but would nonetheless benefit from early notification that help is available. By establishing early live contact with borrowers, servicers would be able to begin working with the borrower to develop appropriate relief at the early stages of a delinquency. The Bureau recognizes that, by giving servicers flexibility to determine whether it is appropriate under the circumstances to notify borrowers about loss mitigation options, there is some risk that servicers, despite their reasonable exercise of discretion, may incorrectly determine a borrower is experiencing a short-term delinquency. The Bureau believes that, on balance, the potential that delinquent borrowers may remain uninformed of their options is mitigated by the requirement in § 1024.39(b)(1), discussed below, to provide a written notice not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 39(a)-1.i would have clarified that the proposed oral notice would have to be made through live contact or good faith efforts to make live contact, such as by telephoning or conducting an in-person meeting with the borrower, but not leaving a recorded message. The final rule adopts proposed comment 39(a)-1.i substantially as proposed, which the Bureau has renumbered as comment 39(a)-2 for organizational purposes. Final comment 39(a)-2 includes guidance appearing in proposed comment 39(a)-1.i about the meaning of live contact, but omits reference to the notice required under 1024.39(a) because, as discussed immediately below, the final rule does not require servicers to inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options under § 1024.39(a) during live contact. Final comment 39(a)-2 further clarifies that a servicer may, but need not, rely on live contact established at the borrower's initiative to satisfy the live contact requirement in § 1024.39(a). Final comment 39(a)-2 also explains that live contact provides servicers an opportunity to discuss the circumstances of a borrower's delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-3.ii to clarify that, if appropriate, servicers may inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options orally, in writing, or through electronic communication, but that servicers must provide such information promptly after the servicer establishes live contact. This comment is intended to provide servicers flexibility in notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options at the early stages of delinquency. The Bureau believes establishing initial live contact is important for a servicer to learn about the circumstances for a borrower's delinquency and to determine whether it is appropriate under the circumstances to inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options. The Bureau believes that providing borrowers with initial notice about the availability of loss mitigation options may be accomplished through an oral conversation or information delivered in writing, as long as it is provided promptly after the servicer establishes live contact, if appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 39(a)-3.ii further explains that a servicer need not notify a borrower about any particular loss mitigation options promptly after the servicer determines that a borrower should be informed of loss mitigation options; a servicer need only inform a borrower generally that loss mitigation options may be available. This comment is substantially similar to proposed comment 39(a)-1.ii. The Bureau is not requiring that servicers to provide detailed information about all loss mitigation options, application deadlines, or foreclosure timelines because not all borrowers may benefit from such a conversation at the time of this contact. Further, the Bureau believes the continuity of contact provisions at § 1024.40 will serve to provide borrowers with access to personnel who can assist them with loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.ii also explains that, if appropriate, a servicer may satisfy the requirement in § 1024.39(a) to inform a borrower about loss mitigation options by providing the written notice required by § 1024.39(b)(1), but the servicer must provide such notice promptly after the servicer establishes live contact. The Bureau believes that the written notice that must be provided by the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency pursuant to § 1024.39(a) provides sufficient information about the availability of loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Good Faith Efforts</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters who assert that servicers should be permitted to engage in a wide variety of methods of contacting borrowers who may be difficult to reach by telephone. Accordingly, in the final rule, the Bureau has developed a more flexible good faith efforts standard. Proposed § 1024.39(a) would have provided that, if the servicer attempts to notify the borrower about loss mitigation options by telephone, good faith efforts would require calling the borrower on at least three separate days in order to reach the borrower. The final rule does not define good faith efforts to establish live contact by identifying a particular number of days to reach the borrower. Instead, comment 39(a)-2 clarifies that good faith efforts to establish live contact consist of reasonable steps under the circumstances to reach a borrower and may include telephoning the borrower on more than one occasion or sending written or electronic communication encouraging the borrower to establish live contact with the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, by permitting servicers to satisfy the good faith efforts standard through a wider variety of methods, servicers will be able to reach borrowers who may be difficult to reach by phone, particularly if a servicer does not have access to a borrower's mobile phone or if a borrower is unreachable by phone during the day. In addition, permitting servicers to satisfy the good faith efforts standard through written or electronic communication encouraging the borrower to establish live contact addresses servicer concerns about tracking and compliance risks associated with the proposed oral notice requirement.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is permitting servicers to contact borrowers through a variety of means, the Bureau is not requiring servicers to contact borrowers through every means of contact possible because it would be difficult, if not impossible, to satisfy such a standard. The Bureau is not requiring servicers to leave a voicemail message when such an option is available because such a requirement may implicate privacy concerns. The Bureau is not adopting a requirement mandating that servicers establish in-person contact or so-called “field calls” to the borrower's residence. While such methods of contact may be effective methods of reaching delinquent borrowers, the Bureau believes telephone calls are equally, if not more effective in certain circumstances, and mandating an in-person contact requirement would be unduly burdensome for most servicers. Of course, a servicer could choose to establish live contact through in-person meetings.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>36th Day of Delinquency</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(a) would have required servicers to provide the oral notice not later than 30 days after a payment due date. In light of comments received, the Bureau is not adopting the 30-day timeframe in proposed § 1024.39(a) and instead is adopting a requirement that a servicer establish live contact not later than the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency to determine whether to inform such borrower that loss mitigation options may be available.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters stated that providing notices too early would be unnecessary for borrowers capable of curing a short-term delinquency or for borrowers at low risk of default, and that providing notice of loss mitigation, in such circumstances, may interfere with sound delinquency management. A variety of servicers and trade associations recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 40 or 45 days and one trade association recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 60 days to provide servicers with maximum flexibility. One industry commenter indicated that a 30-day timeframe would be burdensome for servicers that honor a 15-day grace period because it would only leave servicers only 15 days to satisfy the good faith efforts standard. Trade associations, community banks, and rural lenders were concerned that the Bureau's requirements might be duplicative of or not perfectly aligned with existing requirements. Some commenters requested that the Bureau create an exemption from the 30-day deadline for servicers that employ a behavior modeling tool. In contrast, consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau maintain the 30-day period and include more information in the oral notice. One consumer advocate recommended that borrowers be notified about their options as soon as their account is deemed delinquent by the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is retaining a deadline by which a servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact, but the Bureau is adjusting the timing of the deadline from the 30-day period originally proposed to a 36-day period. As the Bureau recognized in its proposal, certain borrowers may be temporarily delinquent because of an accidental missed payment, a technical error in transferring funds, a short-term payment difficulty, or some other reason. These borrowers may be able to cure a delinquency without a servicer's efforts to make live contact. Thus, if the borrower fully satisfies the payment before the end of the 36-day period, the servicer would not be required to establish live contact or otherwise comply with § 1024.39(a). Proposed comment 39(a)-4 explained that a servicer would not be required to notify or make good faith efforts to notify a borrower unless the borrower remains late in making a payment during the 30-day period after the payment due date. A similar comment appears in 39(a)-1.iv, revised to reflect the new 36-day period.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau noted in its proposal, there is risk to borrowers as a result of a delay in notifying borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available; research indicates that the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure.<footnote ref="131">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; John C.

            In general, calls must occur every three days through day 36 of delinquency, and follow-up calls are required after borrower solicitation packages have been sent. Other standards, such as HAMP<footnote ref="133">Under HAMP, servicers must pre-screen all first lien mortgage loans where two or more payments are due and unpaid (at least 31 days delinquent).

            typically provide for the commencement of outreach efforts to communicate loss mitigation options for potentially eligible borrowers after two missed payments.

            However, HUD Mortgagee Letter 98-18 provides that, at the lender's discretion following a formal risk assessment, borrowers with FHA loans at low risk for foreclosure may be contacted by phone by the 45th day of delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adjusting the timing by which a servicer must establish live contact from 30 to 36 days to be more consistent with GSE outbound call guidelines, HAMP, and the National Mortgage Settlement, and to give borrowers more time to cure a delinquency before a servicer attempts to establish live contact. In addition, a 36-day deadline would help servicers screen for delinquent borrowers who regularly pay late, by permitting servicers to identify borrowers at risk of missing two payment deadlines before attempting efforts to contact them. The Bureau understands that servicers may not be able to complete an initial eligibility evaluation prior to the deadline for contact (potentially within five days after a second missed payment due date). However, the Bureau's rule would only require servicers to establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers and inform such borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options promptly after establishing live contact “if appropriate.” Where a servicer determines that it would be appropriate to inform a borrower about the availability of such options, comment 39(a)-3.ii clarifies that a servicer need not notify borrowers about specific loss mitigation options under 1024.39(a), but only that loss mitigation options may be available. In addition, even if servicers have not completed an initial eligibility evaluation by the time of oral contact, the Bureau believes delinquent borrowers would still benefit from hearing about any other loss mitigation options for which they may be eligible. The Bureau believes a 36-day standard would be consistent with the Settlement terms requiring servicers to commence outreach efforts after the second missed payment. Under § 1024.39(a), servicers must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers by the 36th day of delinquency, which would occur after a second missed payment is due. Moreover, servicers need not inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options at the time of establishing live contact (if appropriate); § 1024.39(a) requires that they do so promptly after establishing live contact. The Bureau declines to adopt a requirement to contact borrowers as soon as they become delinquent because the Bureau believes such a requirement would be overbroad, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to adopt a general 40- or 45-day standard for all borrowers because the Bureau believes borrowers who may be experiencing the early stages of a long-term delinquency are, on balance, likely to benefit from earlier contact, and the Bureau believes that by the 36th day of a delinquency, servicers would know whether a borrower has missed two payments (subject only to the possibility that the payment will be received before the expiration of the grace period for the second payment). The Bureau believes that borrowers who miss two payments generally will present a greater financial risk than borrowers who are only one month late. The Bureau believes servicers should be required to establish live contact, or make good faith efforts to do so, not later than several days after a borrower has missed a second payment due date so the servicer may begin to learn about the circumstances of a borrower's delinquency. Of course, servicers may elect to contact borrowers sooner, and the Bureau believes most servicers will do so pursuant to GSE, FHA, and VA guidelines. Finally, the Bureau declines to permit servicers to delay contact for borrowers identified as low-risk based on a servicer's use of a behavior modeling tool. The Bureau is concerned that modeling tools used to predict future behavior are inherently imprecise and produce a certain percentage of false negatives— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> borrowers who are predicted to self-cure but do not. As also discussed below, at this time, the Bureau does not have sufficient data to evaluate or validate such tools.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>To account for situations in which a borrower proactively contacts the servicer about a late payment, proposed comment 39(a)-5 explained that, if the borrower contacts the servicer at any time prior to the end of the 30-day period to explain that the borrower expects to be late in making a payment, the servicer could provide the oral notice under proposed § 1024.39(a) by informing the borrower at that time that loss mitigation options, if applicable, may be available. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 39(a)-5 or the two illustrative examples at proposed 39(a)-5.i.A or -5.i.B. The Bureau is omitting these comments from the final rule because the Bureau does not believe they are necessary in light of the clarifications provided in comment 39(a)-2 (establishing live contact).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed in § 1024.39(a) to require a servicer to provide an oral notice, or make good faith efforts to do so, if the borrower is late in making “a payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow.” Thus, a servicer would not have been required to provide the oral notice if a borrower is late only with respect to paying a late fee for a given billing cycle. As explained in the proposal, the Bureau proposed this trigger because the Bureau believes there is low risk that borrowers will default solely because of accumulated late charges if they are otherwise current with respect to principal, interest, and escrow payments. The Bureau proposed to add comment 39(a)-3 to explain that, for purposes of proposed § 1024.39(a), a payment would be considered late the day after a payment due date, even if the borrower is afforded a grace period before the servicer assesses a late fee. Thus, for example, if a payment due date is January 1, the servicer would be required to notify or make good faith efforts to notify the borrower not later than 30 days after January 1 (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> by January 31) if the borrower has not fully paid the amount owed as of January 1 and the full payment remains due during that period.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on what constitutes a late payment for purposes of providing the oral notice and is adopting a substantially similar standard in the final rule, which the Bureau has defined as “delinquency” for purposes of § 1024.39. The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-1.i to clarify that, for purposes of § 1024.39, delinquency begins on the day a payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow for a given billing cycle is due and unpaid, even if the borrower is afforded a period after the due date to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee. For example, if a payment due date is January 1 and the amount due is not fully paid during the 36-day period after January 1, the servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact not later than 36 days after January 1— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> by February 6. Delinquency is calculated in a similar manner with respect to the written notice under § 1024.39(b)(1) that must be provided by the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency. The Bureau uses the term “delinquency” in the final rule to improve and clarify the proposed regulatory text and intends no substantive difference from the proposal. Unlike proposed comment 39(b)(1)-2, comment 39(a)(1)-1.i does not use the term “grace period” but instead uses the phrase “period of time after the due date has passed to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee.” The Bureau intends no substantive difference between the final rule and the proposal, but has made this change to conform to similar changes in the Bureau's 2013 TILA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 39(a)-6 clarified that a servicer would not be required under § 1024.39(a) to provide the oral notice to a borrower who is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option designed to bring the borrower current on a previously missed payment. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 39(a)-6 and is adopting it substantially as proposed, but reorganized under comment 39(a)-1 as a clarification to whether a borrower is “delinquent” for purposes of § 1024.39(a). Thus, comment 39(a)-1.ii explains that a borrower who is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option designed to bring the borrower current on a previously missed payment is not delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Rural and community bank commenters requested clarification on whether the oral and written notices would be required to be provided on a recurring basis for borrowers who satisfy their mortgage payments late on a recurring basis and who may be unresponsive to servicer collection efforts. The Bureau has addressed the issue of recurring delinquencies with regard to the written notice below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.39(b), discussed below. With respect to the live contact requirement, servicers would be required to establish live contact or make good faith efforts to do so with borrowers to determine whether to inform borrowers of loss mitigation options. Thus, a servicer must establish live contact or make good faith effort to establish live contact, even with borrowers who are regularly delinquent, by the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency. However, it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether it would be appropriate to inform a borrower who is delinquent on a recurring, month-to-month basis about the availability of loss mitigation options.

                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added this comment to address situations that may arise during the 60 days after a servicing transfer. RESPA section 6(d) provides that, during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of servicing of any federally related mortgage loan, a late fee may not be imposed on the borrower with respect to any payment on such loan and no such payment may be treated as late for any other purposes, if the payment is received by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer who should properly receive the payment) before the due date applicable to such payment. 12 U.S.C. 2605(d). This provision is implemented through current § 1024.21(d)(5), which the Bureau is moving and finalizing as § 1024.33(c)(1). As explained in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.33(c)(1) above, the Bureau has added comment 33(c)(1)-2 to clarify a transferee servicer's compliance with 1024.39 during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of a servicing transfer does not constitute treating a payment as late for purposes of § 1024.33(c)(1). The Bureau has added comment 33(c)(1)-2 to address situations in which a transferee servicer does not know the reasons for a late payment but may still need to comply with § 1024.39 in the face of this uncertainty.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>To account for situations in which the transferee servicer learns that a borrower has simply misdirected a timely payment, the Bureau has added comment 39(a)-1.iii to clarify that, during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, a borrower is not delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39 if the transferee servicer learns that the borrower has made a timely payment that has been misdirected to the transferor servicer and the transferee servicer documents its files accordingly. In such cases, the Bureau does not believe such borrowers should be treated as delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39. Comment 39(a)-1.iii also contains cross-references to § 1024.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)(1)-2. To clarify that this guidance also applies to § 1024.39(b), comment 39(b)(1)-1 includes a cross-reference to comment 39(a)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Borrower's representative.</em> Several consumer group commenters and a housing counseling organization requested that the Bureau clarify that a servicer must communicate with a borrower's representative. The Bureau agrees that, in certain situations, such as where the borrower is represented by an attorney, it may be appropriate for servicers to communicate with the borrower's authorized representative, particularly in situations involving delinquency that may result in foreclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 39(a)-4 to explain that § 1024.39 does not prohibit a servicer from satisfying the requirements of § 1024.39 by establishing live contact with, and, if applicable, providing information about loss mitigation to a person authorized by the borrower to communicate with the servicer on the borrower's behalf. The comment provides that a servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. This comment is similar to comments 35(a)-1, 36(a)-1, and 40(a)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to specifically require servicers to communicate with a borrower's representative for purposes of § 1024.39. By comparison, the requirements applicable to notices of error and information requests under §§ 1024.35 and 36 include comments 35(a)-1 and 36(a)-1, which explain that notices of error and information requests from a borrower's representative are treated the same way that servicers treat such communications from a borrower though the servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. In situations involving notices of error or information requests, in which a borrower requests through a representative that the servicer take some action that the servicer may not otherwise perform, there is some risk that a servicer might claim it had no obligation to act if the regulation only required actions with respect to the “borrower.” However, § 1024.39 requires that servicers reach out to borrowers. Thus, the risk that servicers would claim they had no obligation to act with respect to a borrower is not present in this case; to the contrary, the Bureau believes it would mitigate the burden on the servicer to be able to communicate with either the borrower or the borrower's representative.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>39(b)(1) Notice Required</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting a written notice requirement that has been slightly revised from the proposal. The Bureau proposed § 1024.39(b)(1) to require servicers to provide borrowers who are late in making a payment with a written notice containing information about the foreclosure process, contact information for housing counselors and the borrower's State housing finance authority, and, if applicable, loss mitigation options. The Bureau proposed to require that this notice be provided not later than 40 days after the payment due date. Proposed comment 39(b)(1)-1 explained that the written notice would be required even if the servicer provided information about loss mitigation and the foreclosure process previously during the oral notice under § 1024.39(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups were generally supportive of a written notice, although they recommended including more detail about loss mitigation options, application instructions, and foreclosure timelines. Industry commenters were concerned that the written notice requirement would conflict with existing early intervention requirements and recommended that the Bureau provide more flexibility with respect to the content of the notice and that the Bureau extend the deadline for providing the written notice. Some commenters questioned the necessity of the written notice in light of an oral notice requirement and other existing requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a written notice requirement in the final rule at § 1024.39(b). Borrowers may not receive information about loss mitigation options either because the servicer is unable to establish live contact with a borrower despite good faith efforts or because the servicer exercises reasonable discretion to determine that providing information about loss mitigation options is not appropriate. Further, as the Bureau noted in its proposal, even if a borrower receives information about the availability of loss mitigation options orally, the Bureau believes a written notice is still necessary if a borrower has not cured by day 45 because borrowers may be unable to adequately assess and recall detailed information provided orally and the written notice would provide more information than what would likely have been provided under § 1024.39(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, a written disclosure would provide borrowers with the ability to review the information or discuss it with a housing counselor or other advisor. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 39(b)(1)-1 substantially as proposed. The proposed comment explained that the written notice would be required even if the servicer provided information about loss mitigation and the foreclosure process previously during an oral communication under § 1024.39(a). In the final rule, the Bureau has omitted the reference to foreclosure and renumbered this comment as 39(b)(1)-4 for organizational purposes. The Bureau has also included new comment 39(b)(1)-3 to provide a cross-reference to comment 39(a)-4 to clarify that the Bureau's guidance with respect to communicating with a borrower's representative also applies to the written notice provision at § 1024.39(b).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to comments, however, the Bureau is adjusting the timing of the notice from 40 to 45 days after a missed payment and is making certain adjustments to the proposed content of the notice. To assist servicers in complying with the notice requirement, the Bureau is adopting model clauses, referenced in § 1024.39(b)(3), which the Bureau has amended. The model clauses are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of appendix MS-4.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters were concerned that the breadth of the definition of “Loss mitigation options” would require servicers to offer options or take actions inconsistent with investor or guarantor requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe the written notice requirement in § 1024.39(b) will pose a conflict with investor or guarantor requirements and is adopting it as applicable to servicers of all mortgage loans, with certain exemptions and limitations in scope, as discussed above.<footnote ref="136">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(b), above, the Bureau is adopting exemptions from § 1024.39 for small servicers, servicers with respect to reverse mortgage transactions, and servicers with respect to mortgage loans for which the servicer is a qualified lender (as defined in 12 CFR 617.7000). In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(c), § 1024.39 does not apply to any mortgage loan that is not secured by a borrower's principal residence.</footnote>
            Given the breadth of the definition of “Loss mitigation option” and the general industry practice of offering some sort of short-term relief or at least accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the Bureau expects that few servicers would not offer any loss mitigation options. In addition, the definition of “Loss mitigation option” is limited to options offered by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that are available through the servicer. Thus, options that are not offered by an owner or assignee and thus not available through the servicer would not be required to be listed. In addition, the Bureau has developed flexible content requirements in the written notice with regard to how and which loss mitigation options are described. Finally, the Bureau has retained the “if applicable” qualifier in § 1024.39(b)(2) setting forth requirements to describe loss mitigation options. Thus, if an owner or assignee of a loan offers no loss mitigation options for delinquent borrowers, the servicer would not be required to include statements describing loss mitigation options, but would still be required to send a notice encouraging the borrower to contact the servicer and containing information about housing counselors; the Bureau believes borrowers would benefit from information about how to contact their servicer or housing counselors to ask questions, for example, about how the foreclosure process works.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>45th Day of Delinquency</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Similar to the proposed oral notice, the Bureau proposed in § 1024.39(b) to require servicers to provide the written notice if a borrower is late in making a payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow. However, unlike the proposed oral notice that servicers would have been required to provide, or make good faith efforts to provide, not later than 30 days after a payment due date, the Bureau proposed to require that the written notice be provided not later than 40 days after the payment due date. The Bureau had proposed a 40-day deadline to provide borrowers a reasonable opportunity to cure a short-term delinquency while also ensuring that they received information on loss mitigation options at the early stages of a delinquency. The Bureau proposed to permit servicers to provide the written notice at any time during the 40-day period. The Bureau proposed a deadline for the written notice that occurred after the 30-day deadline for the proposed oral notice to provide servicers an opportunity to tailor the written notice and other information to the borrower's individual circumstances following the oral notice. However, servicers would also have had the option of sending the notice at any time after the borrower's missed payment. The Bureau proposed to include guidance at comment 39(b)(1)-2 to clarify that servicers should consider a payment late in the same manner as they would for purposes of calculating when the oral notice must be provided. The Bureau solicited comment on whether the written deadline should be extended to 45 days, 65 days, or longer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups and one industry commenter were generally supportive of the timing of the written notice as proposed, although one consumer advocacy group recommended that borrowers receive a more detailed notice 60 days after the missed payment following a lighter notice about loss mitigation options immediately after a delinquency. Most industry commenters recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline for the written notice to sometime between 45 and 70 days after a missed payment. Industry commenters argued that extending the deadline would preserve servicer flexibility in managing delinquencies and reduce the compliance burden in light of existing early intervention practices and requirements. Similar to arguments made about the proposed oral notice, industry commenters and a Federal agency expressed concern that informing a borrower of loss mitigation options that the borrower does not qualify for or that are not available to the borrower could cause borrower confusion and impede the resolution of delinquent loans.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and several consumer advocacy groups noted that extending the deadline for the written notice would allow servicers time to distinguish between high- and low-risk borrowers, allowing servicers to focus on high-risk borrowers while avoiding the need to make contact with borrowers who are able to self-cure the occasional late payment or those who are repeatedly delinquent but who eventually make their payments. Several industry commenters recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 60 days to permit servicers additional time to complete an eligibility assessment required under HAMP and the National Mortgage Settlement. One trade association noted that the Bureau's original outline of proposals under consideration included a proposal for servicers to provide borrowers with written information about loss mitigation options within five days after notifying the servicer that they may have trouble making their payments. The commenter requested that this be a requirement in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, as with the proposed oral notice, industry commenters were concerned that the Bureau's requirements may be duplicative of or not perfectly aligned with existing State and Federal requirements, GSE guidelines, consent orders, and settlement agreements. Many industry commenters noted that a 40-day deadline would be premature and that it would be more efficient, common, and would avoid borrower confusion to send the notice by 45 days after a missed payment, consistent with other notices that servicers send by that time, such as breach letters, a notice under section 106(c)(5) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, regarding the availability of housing counselors (12 U.S.C. 1701x(c)(5)(B)), and a notice under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. 501 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.</em>).<footnote ref="137">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Form, U.S. Hous. &amp;amp; Urban Dev., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Service Members Civil Relief Act Form HUD-92070&lt;/em&gt; (June 30, 2011), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=92070.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            One large servicer explained that extending the deadline from 40 to 45 days would still provide borrowers with sufficient notice of loss mitigation options before a servicer begins the foreclosure process. One industry commenter recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 50 days after the payment due date to better accommodate other loss mitigation-related communications that go out by the 45th day of delinquency. In addition, a variety of servicers and trade associations requested additional flexibility in delivering the content of the written notice, such as by combining the proposed written notice requirement with existing notices.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The GSEs, certain large lenders, and trade associations, as well as several consumer advocacy groups, recommended that the Bureau permit servicers to send the written notice by the 60th, 65th or 70th day of a borrower's delinquency. Other industry commenters and a few consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to sometime between 60 and 70 days after a missed payment. A number of commenters expressed concern that the proposed 40-day notice was not in line with GSE guidelines that permit servicers to send a loss mitigation solicitation package to borrowers identified by the servicer as low default risks by the 65th day of the borrower's delinquency. Other commenters recommended that the Bureau permit an exemption from the 40-day deadline for servicers to comply with a later deadline if the servicer uses behavior modeling to identify chronically late payers that do not appear at risk of serious delinquency and where the notice is unlikely to be helpful, in order to better align with GSE practice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is adopting a 45-day deadline rather than a 40-day deadline in the final rule. First, the Bureau believes that a 45-day deadline strikes an appropriate balance between permitting servicers flexibility in managing delinquencies and providing borrowers information at the early stages of a delinquency. Some borrowers are in the habit of making their mortgage payments after the due date in order to take advantage of the 15-day period generally available to make payment without incurring a late fee. A borrower who has missed a payment entirely may likewise wait until up to the 15th day after the next payment is due (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the 45th day after the initial payment was due) before making a payment. A 45-day deadline would permit borrowers to receive a written notice of loss mitigation options at the early stages of their delinquency while also permitting servicers to distinguish between borrowers who can self-cure out of a 30-day delinquency and those experiencing longer-term problems. The Bureau believes that the fact that a borrower has not satisfied a late payment by the 45th day of a delinquency generally indicates that such borrower is having difficulty making payments and should be informed of the availability of loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that some servicers may not be able to complete eligibility assessments for borrowers by the 45th day of a delinquency under HAMP (which is set to expire by December 31, 2013).<footnote ref="138">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Dep't of Treasury &amp;amp; U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp;amp; Urban Dev., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Home Affordable Modification Program, available at http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/lower-payments/Pages/hamp.aspx&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            However, the Bureau's rule would not require that servicers make a determination of eligibility of loss mitigation options by this time; they require only that they notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available. The Bureau has crafted flexible content standards that would not require servicers to list specific loss mitigation options in the written notice. With respect to the National Mortgage Settlement, the Bureau believes a 45-day standard would be in line with the Settlement terms requiring servicers to commence outreach efforts after the second missed payment.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that GSE servicers have additional flexibility in providing the solicitation package to certain lower-risk borrowers as late as the 65th day of their delinquency.<footnote ref="139">The GSEs allow servicers to rely on the results of a behavioral modeling tool to evaluate a borrower's risk profile.

            As noted above, several industry commenters and consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline for the written notice to sometime between 60 and 70 days after a missed payment in order to accommodate this GSE practice. However, the Bureau is not adopting an exemption for servicers who use behavior modeling tools to identify lower-risk borrowers for the following reasons. Evidence available to the Bureau indicates that the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure,<footnote ref="140">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; John C.

            While waiting to day 65 to see if a delinquent borrower has self-cured may be appropriate for low-risk borrowers, modeling tools to predict future behavior are inherently imprecise and identify a certain number of borrowers who are predicted to self-cure but do not. At this time, the Bureau does not have data with which to validate or evaluate such models. Further, the Bureau is concerned that if these borrowers are not informed of their options until the beginning of the third month of their delinquency, it may be more difficult for them to find a solution than if they were notified sooner.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau appreciates that a 45-day notice requirement might result in notices to borrowers who would self-cure without any notice. On balance, however, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to be potentially overbroad to avoid situations in which borrowers may not receive any information until potentially three months of missed payments. The Bureau has sought to address the compliance burden on GSE servicers who use behavior modeling tools by creating flexible content standards for the written notice. The Bureau has also sought to limit the burden of sending the notice by limiting the number of times a borrower would receive the notice, as discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau believes a 45-day deadline would be more consistent with other notices that servicers send by that time than the 40-day deadline as originally proposed. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.39(b)(2), the Bureau has sought to adopt flexible content requirements for the 45-day written notice to accommodate existing early intervention notices. The Bureau agrees that permitting servicers to comply with § 1024.39(b) by combining other notices that go out at this time would reduce possible confusion among borrowers as well as compliance burden. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the discussion of comment 39(b)(2)-3 below.

In addition, HUD has developed a notice pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, as amended, providing notice of servicemembers' rights that must be provided within 45 days of a missed payment. Servicers of GSE loans are expected to send a written package soliciting delinquent borrowers to apply for loss mitigation options 31 to 35 days after a payment due date, unless the servicer has made contact with the borrower and received a promise to cure the delinquency within 30 days.<footnote ref="144">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Fannie Mae, Letters and Notice Guidelines (Apr. 25, 2012), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at https://www.efanniemae.com/home/index.jsp&lt;/em&gt; ; Freddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicing Guide, Volume 2, Chapter 64.5 (2012).

                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting a requirement in the final rule for servicers to provide the § 1024.39(b) written notice based solely on a borrower's indication of difficulty in making payment. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to § 1024.39(a) and comment 39(a)-3.i, servicers must promptly inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options if appropriate, which servicers may determine based on their exercise of reasonable discretion. If the servicer determines informing a borrower of loss mitigation options is appropriate, they may choose to do so orally or in writing, in accordance with comment 39(a)-3.ii. The Bureau believes a strict 45-day deadline for the written notice required under § 1024.39(b) is necessary to mitigate the risk that borrowers may not receive notice of the availability of loss mitigation options pursuant § 1024.39(a): a servicer may not establish live contact with a borrower despite good faith efforts to do, or a servicer may make a reasonable determination that such notice is not appropriate under § 1024.39(a). In addition, as previously noted, a single deadline would provide servicers with flexibility, within the deadline, to determine the most appropriate time to provide the written notice, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> for borrowers who may be able to self-cure. Finally, the Bureau believes that new § 1024.36, which will require servicers to respond to information requests, and new § 1024.38(b)(2)(i), which requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that servicers provide accurate information regarding loss mitigation options available to a borrower, will address situations in which borrowers request information about loss mitigation and foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau uses the term “delinquency” to identify when the 45-day period begins. The Bureau has clarified the meaning of delinquency in commentary in a manner substantially similar to the late payment trigger that was proposed in § 1024.39(b). Accordingly, in the final rule, § 1024.39(a) requires a servicer to provide the written notice not later than the 45th day of “a borrower's delinquency.” Comment 39(b)(1)-1 contains a cross-reference to comment 39(a)-1, which generally explains that delinquency begins on the day a payment sufficient to cover, principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow for a given billing cycle is due and unpaid, even if the borrower is afforded a period of time after the due date has passed to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee. The cross-reference also clarifies that a borrower is not delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39 if the borrower is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option designed to bring the borrower current on a previously missed payment.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 39(b)(1)-1 provides an example substantially similar to the example proposed as comment 39(b)(1)-2, in which a borrower misses a January 1 payment that remains due during the 45-day period after January 1, requiring that the servicer provide the written notice by February 15. Comment 39(b)(1)-1 also contains an example similar to the example in proposed comment 39(b)(1)-3, which explained that a servicer is not required to provide the written notice if the borrower makes the payment during the 45 days after the payment due date. The Bureau has also replaced the 40-day period in the comment with a 45-day period to conform to changes adopted in the final rule regarding the timing of the written notice. The Bureau has made this change to clarify that the notice must be provided only if the borrower is delinquent, and must be provided not later than the 45th day of the borrower's delinquency.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Frequency of the Notice</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(1) would have provided that a servicer would not be required to provide the written notice under § 1024.39(b) more than once during any 180-day period beginning on the date on which the disclosure is provided. Proposed comment 39(b)(1)-4 further explained that, notwithstanding this limitation, a servicer would still be required to provide the oral notice required under § 1024.39(a) for each payment that is overdue. Several commenters provided feedback on the frequency of the written notice. Two consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau require the notice be resent if the borrower redefaults on the mortgage loan. Other consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers provide the notice again based on the results of a behavior modeling tool.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is retaining the proposed 180-day limitation in § 1024.39(b)(1). The Bureau is also retaining substantially all of the language in comment 39(b)(1)-4, which the Bureau is renumbering to comment 39(b)(1)-2. The Bureau has replaced the 40-day time periods in the examples in the commentary with 45-day time periods to conform to the final rule; the Bureau is also omitting the reference in the proposed comment to 39(a) in the last example in light of the Bureau's change to the nature of the proposed oral notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is requiring that servicers provide the notice once every 180 days to limit the number of times a servicer would have to send the notice to borrowers who consistently pay late but otherwise eventually make their payments. The Bureau does not believe that borrowers who consistently carry a short-term delinquency would benefit from receiving the same written notice every month. Because § 1024.32 requires that the written notice be provided in a form the borrower may keep, borrowers would be able to retain the disclosure for future reference. In addition, a 180-day timeframe is generally consistent with HUD's requirement that, in connection with FHA loans, HUD's “Avoiding Foreclosure” pamphlet must be resent to delinquent borrowers unless the beginning of the new delinquency occurs less than six months after the pamphlet was last mailed.<footnote ref="145">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 24 CFR 203.602; U.S. Hous. &amp;amp; Urban Dev., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;HUD Handbook 4330.1 rev-5,&lt;/em&gt; ch. 7, para. 7-7(G).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement to provide the notice once every 180 days as well as the requirement in § 1024.40(a) to make servicer personnel available to borrowers not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency will, as a practical matter, address situations in which borrowers may redefault. Further, § 1024.39(a) requires that servicers establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers with respect to every delinquency and promptly inform such borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available if appropriate, subject to a servicer's reasonable exercise of discretion. In addition, borrowers who previously worked with servicer personnel assigned under the continuity of contact rule to develop a loss mitigation option would know that they may contact their servicer to discuss loss mitigation options. The Bureau is not adopting an exemption based on a servicer's use of a behavior modeling tool for the reasons discussed above with respect to the timing of the written notice.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>39(b)(2) Content of the Written Notice</title>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>In General</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add new § 1024.39(b)(2) to set forth information that servicers would be required to include in the written notice. Under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of proposed § 1024.39, servicers would have been required to include a statement encouraging the borrower to contact the servicer, along with the servicer's mailing address and telephone number. Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) of proposed § 1024.39, servicers would have been required, if applicable, to include a statement providing a brief description of loss mitigation options that may be available, as well as a statement explaining how the borrower can obtain additional information about those options. Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v) would have required servicers to include a statement explaining that foreclosure is a process to end the borrower's ownership of the property. Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v) also would have required servicers to provide an estimate for when the servicer may start the foreclosure process. This estimate would have been required to be expressed in a number of days from the date of a missed payment. Finally, proposed § 1024.39(b)(iv) would have required servicers to include contact information for any State housing finance authorities, as defined in FIRREA section 1301, for the State in which the property is located, and either the Bureau or HUD list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, particularly smaller servicers, were generally concerned that the written notice was too prescriptive. A number of industry commenters requested clarification whether the Bureau's notice would be in addition to other similar notices that servicers may be already providing to borrowers. A variety of servicers and several trade associations recommended that the Bureau permit servicers to combine the § 1024.39(b) notice with other notices servicers send around the 45-day time period to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of information overload. One industry commenter recommended that the Bureau allow an exemption from the written notice where existing notices satisfy the content requirements of the rule, or permit servicers to consolidate the required information into an existing letter. A non-bank servicer requested clarification on whether servicers would have flexibility in how servicers delivered the content in the written notices, such as by permitting the use of logos, color, web sites, and additional information beyond what was required.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau require more information in the written notice, particularly information about all available loss mitigation options from the servicer, detailed application instructions and eligibility requirements, and foreclosure referral deadlines. One coalition of consumer advocacy groups supported the Bureau's proposal to include model clauses, explaining that they would mitigate the cost of creating written notice forms, but would also set an essential standard for content and level of detail, and help ensure that all borrowers receive the same information, regardless of the type of servicer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted in the proposal, the Bureau sought to establish minimum standards such that servicers that are already providing adequate notices of loss mitigation options would already be in compliance. The Bureau is not adopting standardized written notices because the Bureau continues to believe an overly-prescriptive written notice may not account for the variety of situations posed by delinquent borrowers or the variety of loss mitigation options available from investors and guarantors. Thus, the Bureau is adopting generally applicable minimum content requirements that can be tailored to a specific situations, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.39(b)(2) below. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(b), the Bureau is granting exemptions from § 1024.39 for small servicers, servicers with respect to reverse mortgages, and servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that permitting servicers to incorporate relevant portions of the notice required under § 1024.39(b)(1) into other disclosures that already include some or all of the statements required by § 1024.39(b)(2) would reduce the potential for borrower confusion otherwise resulting from duplicative statements. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 39(b)(2)-3 to clarify that servicers may satisfy the requirement to provide the written notice by grouping other notices that satisfy the content requirements of § 1024.39(b)(2) into the same mailing, provided each of the required statements satisfies the clear and conspicuous standard in § 1024.32(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To accommodate existing servicer requirements and practices, proposed comment 39(b)(2)-1 explained that a servicer may provide additional information beyond the proposed content requirements that the servicer determines would be beneficial to the borrower. This would include any additional disclosures that servicers believe would be helpful, such as directing borrowers to Web sites. In addition, proposed comment 39(b)(2)-2 explained that any color, number of pages, size and quality of paper, type of print, and method of reproduction may be used so long as the disclosure is clearly legible. The Bureau is adopting comments 39(b)(2)-1 and 39(b)(2)-2 substantially as proposed. The Bureau has further amended proposed comment 39(b)(2)-1 to provide that servicers may provide additional information that the servicer determines would be helpful “or which may be required by applicable law or the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan.” The Bureau has added this language to clarify that servicers may provide additional content that may be required by, for example, State law. The Bureau has revised guidance in proposed comment 39(b)(2)-2 that had clarified that the statements required by § 1024.39(b)(2) must be “clearly legible.” Instead, comment 39(b)(2)-2 explains that the statements required by § 1024.39(b)(2) must satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard in § 1024.32(a)(1). The Bureau has made this revision in order to clarify that the § 1024.39(b) written notice is subject to the same legibility standard applicable to other notices, pursuant to § 1024.32(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that comment MS-2, which provides commentary that is generally applicable to the model forms and clauses in appendix MS, clarifies that, except as otherwise specifically required, servicers may add graphics or icons, such as the servicer's corporate logo, to the model forms and clauses. Thus, it is unnecessary to include a comment to § 1024.39(b)(2) to clarify that servicers may include corporate logos. The Bureau has addressed consumer group comments regarding additional content for the written notice below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Statement Encouraging the Borrower to Contact the Servicer</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(i) would have required the written notice to include a statement encouraging the borrower to contact the servicer. The Bureau did not receive comment on this requirement and is adopting it as proposed, renumbered as § 1024.39(b)(2)(i). As noted in its proposal, the Bureau believes that a statement informing borrowers that the servicer can provide assistance with respect to their delinquency is necessary to facilitate a discussion between the borrower and the servicer at the early stages of delinquency. Many borrowers do not know that their servicer can help them avoid foreclosure if they are having trouble making their monthly payments. The Bureau believes a statement encouraging the borrower to call would help remove this barrier to borrower-servicer communication.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(i)-1 explained that the servicer would not be required, for example, to specifically request the borrower to contact the servicer regarding any particular loss mitigation option. The Bureau is not adopting this comment in the final rule because the Bureau does not believe it is necessary in light of comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-1, which explains that § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) does not require that a specific number of examples be disclosed in the written notice.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Contact Information for the Servicer</title>
                <analysisParagraph>To facilitate a dialogue between the servicer and the borrower, proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(ii) would have required the written notice to include the servicer's mailing address and telephone number. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(ii)-1 had explained that, if applicable, a servicer should provide contact information that would put a borrower in touch with servicer personnel under the continuity of contact rule at § 1024.40. Under § 1024.40(a)(2), servicers are generally required to maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring that a servicer makes available to a delinquent borrower telephone access to servicer personnel to respond to borrower inquiries and, as applicable, assist with loss mitigation options by the time the servicer provides the borrower with the § 1024.39(b) written notice, but in any event not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.40(a) below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is moving language from comment 39(b)(2)(ii)-1 to regulation text to clarify that servicers are required to provide the telephone number to access servicer personnel assigned under § 1024.40(a) and the servicer's mailing address. The Bureau believes it is more appropriate to include as a requirement of § 1024.39(b)(2)(ii), rather than as commentary, that servicers must provide in the written notice the telephone number to access continuity of contact personnel. The Bureau believes that including this contact information will help direct borrowers to continuity of contact personnel who will be able to assist delinquent borrowers.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>Brief Description of Loss Mitigation Options</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) would have required that the written notice include a statement, if applicable, providing a brief description of loss mitigation options that may be available from the servicer. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-1 explained that § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) does not mandate that a specific number of examples be disclosed, but explained that borrowers are likely to benefit from examples that permit them to remain in their homes and examples of options that would require that borrowers end their ownership of the property in order to avoid foreclosure. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-2 explained that an example of a loss mitigation option may be described in one or more sentences. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-2 also explained that if a servicer offers several loss mitigation programs, the servicer may provide a generic description of each option instead of providing detailed descriptions of each program. The comment explained, for example, that if a servicer provides several loan modification programs, it may simply provide a generic description of a loan modification.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers should be required to provide detailed information about all loss mitigation options available from the servicer. One consumer group recommended that servicers provide individually tailored information about a borrower's options depending on the nature of the borrower's loan. Another recommended that servicers be required to inform borrowers specifically what type of loan they have and what options are available to them. By contrast, several industry commenters recommended that the description of loss mitigation options should be minimal, asserting that lengthy explanations could confuse, overwhelm, and discourage borrowers from reaching out to their servicer. One large servicer indicated that, in its experience, providing borrowers with more generic information about loss mitigation options resulted in better contact rates and pull through to complete loan modifications. One industry commenter recommended that any communication regarding loss mitigation options should explicitly state that all loss mitigation options have qualification requirements and that not all options are available to all consumers to address the risk that listing options that are not available to certain borrowers could be perceived as deceptive.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) and the associated commentary substantially as proposed. The Bureau is amending the regulatory text of proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) to require that servicers are required to describe only “examples” of loss mitigation options that may be available. The Bureau has made this revision to clarify the nature of the requirement, consistent with proposed comment 39(a)(2)(iii)-1, which explained that the regulation does not mandate that a specific number of examples be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>At the time the Bureau proposed its early intervention requirements for the Small Business Panel, the Bureau considered requiring servicers to provide a brief description of any loss mitigation programs available to the borrower.<footnote ref="146">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Final Report of the Small Business Review Panel on CFPB's Proposals Under Consideration for Mortgage Servicing Rulemaking,&lt;/em&gt; appendix C (Jun, 11, 2012).</footnote>
            However, the Bureau did not propose, and is not requiring in the final rule, that servicers list all of the loss mitigation options they offer. The Bureau understands that, pursuant to investor or guarantor requirements, eligibility criteria for certain loss mitigation options are complex and may depend on circumstances that may arise over the course of a borrower's delinquency. In addition, the Bureau understands that loss mitigation options may comprise several programs; servicers may have, for example several different types of loan modification options. The Bureau understands that there may be operational difficulties associated with explaining subtle differences among these programs in a written notice. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that a lengthy written notice may undermine the intended effect of encouraging borrowers to contact their servicers to discuss their options. The Bureau is not requiring servicers to provide each borrower with an individually tailored written notice about that borrower's options because the Bureau does not believe it would be practicable for servicers to provide such a notice at this stage of a borrower's delinquency or without additional information about a borrower's particular circumstances. Instead, the Bureau believes borrowers would be better served by servicer continuity of contact personnel explaining, in accordance with policies and procedures required under § 1024.40(b), the various loss mitigation options for which borrowers may be eligible.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In lieu of providing borrowers with information about every option, the Bureau proposed that the written notice contain a statement, if applicable, informing borrowers how to obtain more information about loss mitigation options from the servicer, as well as contact information for housing counseling resources that could provide borrowers with information about other loss mitigation options that might not be listed on the written notice. As adopted in the final rule, the notice must also include the telephone number to access servicer personnel assigned under § 1024.40(a). In addition, the Bureau has included requirements in § 1024.40(b)(1) for servicers to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objectives of providing accurate information regarding loss mitigation options. Pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(ii), servicers must also establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of identifying all loss mitigation options for which a borrower may be eligible. For these reasons and those set forth in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting the § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is retaining proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-1, which explains that § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) does not require that a specific number of examples be disclosed, but that borrowers are likely to benefit from examples of options that would permit them to retain ownership of their home and examples of options that may require borrowers to end their ownership to avoid foreclosure. The comment further explains that a servicer may include a generic list of loss mitigation options that it offers to borrowers, and that it may include a statement that not all borrowers will qualify for all of the listed options, because different loss mitigation options may be available to borrowers depending on the borrower's qualifications or other factors. The Bureau proposed this comment to avoid borrower confusion regarding their eligibility for loss mitigation options listed in the materials. The Bureau agrees that servicers should be able to clarify that not all of the enumerated loss mitigation options will necessarily be available. During consumer testing of the proposed model clauses, all participants understood that the fact that they received this notice did not mean that they would necessarily qualify for these options. The Bureau is adopting this comment substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also retaining proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iii)-2 substantially as proposed, which explains that an example of a loss mitigation option may be described in one or more sentences and that if a servicer offers several loss mitigation programs, the servicer may provide a generic description of the type of option instead of providing detailed descriptions of each program. The Bureau has included this comment because the Bureau recognizes that there may be operational difficulties associated with determining how to explain specialized loss mitigation programs. The Bureau recognizes that loss mitigation options are complex, and providing comprehensive explanations of each option may overwhelm borrowers and may undermine the intended effect of the written notice of encouraging borrowers to get in touch with their servicers to identify appropriate relief. The Bureau does not believe that borrowers would benefit from a disclosure with voluminous detail at the early stage of exploring available options. Instead, the Bureau believes that servicers should provide borrowers with a brief explanation of loss mitigation options and encourage borrowers to contact their servicer to discuss whether any options may be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Explanation of How the Borrower May Obtain More Information About Loss Mitigation Options</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iv) would have required the written notice to include an explanation of how the borrower may obtain more information about loss mitigation options, if applicable. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iv)-1 explained that, at a minimum, a servicer could comply with this requirement by directing the borrower to contact the servicer for more information, such as through a statement like, “contact us for instructions on how to apply.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau require servicers to identify the deadline by which borrowers must send application materials. One consumer group indicated that a requirement to notify borrowers of application deadlines in the written notice was necessary to coordinate with the Bureau's proposed requirement in 1024.41(g) that only applications received by the servicer's deadline are subject to the prohibition on foreclosure sales. In addition to application deadlines, many consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers be required to provide borrowers with eligibility requirements, an application form and application instructions, along with a clear list of required documentation necessary to be considered a complete application, consistent with GSE practice. By contrast, an industry commenter indicated that communications about loss mitigation options should be more general in nature rather than provide too much detail that might overwhelm borrowers. An individual consumer indicated that the most important element of the notice was to inform borrowers who they could contact to discuss their options.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau appreciates that borrowers may benefit from knowing about the applicability of deadlines, the Bureau is concerned that there may be operational difficulties with a requirement to disclose application deadlines in the written notice at § 1024.39(b). Because the Bureau is not requiring servicers to disclose in the written notice all loss mitigation options available from the servicer, the Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to require servicers to disclose all loss mitigation application deadlines that may apply; otherwise, such information could be confusing to borrowers. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that there may be comprehension difficulties associated with an explanation in the § 1024.39(b) written notice of the interaction between application deadlines and deadlines in the Bureau's loss mitigation procedures at § 1024.41. The Bureau believes that a requirement to specifically identify application deadlines in the early intervention notice requires further analysis by the Bureau to address the concern that disclosure of deadlines occurring far in the future might discourage borrowers from acting quickly to resolve a delinquency. See the discussion below under the heading “Foreclosure Statement” for more discussion of the Bureau's concerns about borrower perception of deadlines in the early intervention notice. Further, the Bureau notes that servicers must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicer personnel assigned to a borrower pursuant to § 1024.40(a) provide borrowers accurate information about actions that the borrower must take to be evaluated for loss mitigation options and applicable loss mitigation deadlines established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or § 1024.41. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii) and (v); § 1024.41 (setting forth various procedural requirements and timeframes governing a servicer's consideration of a borrower's loss mitigation application). Finally, because the Bureau is adopting § 1024.41(f)(1) to prohibit servicers from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law unless a borrower's mortgage loan is more than 120 days delinquent, borrowers will have more time to submit loss mitigation applications before a servicer initiates the foreclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting a rule to require servicers to identify application materials in the written notice. At the time the Bureau proposed its early intervention requirements for the Small Business Review Panel, the Bureau considered requiring servicers to provide a brief outline of the requirements for qualifying for any available loss mitigation programs, including documents and other information the borrower must provide, and any timelines that apply.<footnote ref="147">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Final Report of the Small Business Review Panel on CFPB's Proposals Under Consideration for Mortgage Servicing Rulemaking,&lt;/em&gt; appendix C (Jun, 11, 2012).</footnote>
            The Bureau did not propose requiring servicers to provide this level of detail because each loss mitigation option may have its own specific documentation requirements and servicers may be unable to provide comprehensive application instructions generally applicable to all options. Additionally, because the Bureau had proposed that servicers provide only examples of loss mitigation options in the written notice, the proposal noted that detailed instructions for only the listed options may not be useful for all borrowers. The Bureau believes setting consistent and streamlined requirements best achieves the central purpose of the early intervention notice, which is to inform borrowers that help is available and to encourage them to contact their servicer. In addition, the Bureau understands that not all loss mitigation options are necessarily appropriate for every borrower. The Bureau is concerned that a requirement to provide application materials for all options listed in the notice might be overwhelming for borrowers at this stage in the process. Servicers might have multiple loss mitigation options and each may have its own documentation requirements. A requirement to prospectively disclose all documentation requirements for all listed options could prove voluminous. Additionally, a borrower's eligibility for options depends on the borrower's circumstances as well as the stage of delinquency, and the Bureau believes servicers or housing counselors are best suited to advising borrowers about their options during a live conversation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's continuity of contact requirements are designed to assist borrowers who are provided the § 1024.39(b) written notice or who reach a certain stage of delinquency. These requirements are designed to ensure servicers have servicer personnel dedicated to guiding such borrowers through the loss mitigation application process. Pursuant to § 1024.40(a), servicers must maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the objective of making available to a delinquent borrower telephone access to servicer personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries and, as applicable, assist the borrower with loss mitigation options to borrowers by the time the servicer provides the borrower with the § 1024.39(b) written notice but in any event no than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency. Pursuant to § 1024.40(b)(1), the Bureau has set forth objectives that servicer policies and procedures for continuity of contact personnel must be reasonably designed to achieve. These objectives include providing accurate information about loss mitigation options available to a borrower from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan; actions the borrower must take to be evaluated for such options, including actions the borrower must take to submit a complete loss mitigation application, as defined in § 1024.31, and, if applicable, actions the borrower must take to appeal the servicer's determination to deny the borrower's loss mitigation application for any trial or permanent loan modification program offered by the servicer; the status of any loss mitigation application that the borrower has submitted to the servicer; the circumstances under which the servicer may make a referral to foreclosure; and applicable loss mitigation deadlines established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or § 1024.41. The Bureau believes these requirements will help ensure borrowers receive accurate information about how to submit a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Of course, servicers may choose to provide application materials with the written notice. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iv)-1 to explain that, to expedite the borrower's timely application for any loss mitigation options, servicers may wish to provide more detailed instructions on how a borrower could apply, such as by listing representative documents the borrower should make available to the servicer, such as tax filings or income statements, and by providing estimates for when the servicer expects to make a decision on a loss mitigation option. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iv)-1 also provided that servicers may supplement the written notice with a loss mitigation application form. The Bureau is adopting this comment substantially as proposed in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v) would have required that the written notice include a statement explaining that foreclosure is a legal process to end the borrower's ownership of the property. Proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v) also would have required that the notice include an estimate of how many days after a missed payment the servicer makes the referral to foreclosure. The Bureau proposed to clarify through comment 39(b)(2)(v)-1 that the servicer may explain that the foreclosure process may vary depending on the circumstances, such as the location of the borrower's property that secures the loan, whether the borrower is covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and the requirements of the owner or assignee of the borrower's loan. The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 39(b)(2)(v)-2 that the servicer may qualify its estimates with a statement that different timelines may vary depending on the circumstances, such as those listed in comment 39(b)(2)(v)-1. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(v)-2 also explained that the servicer may provide its estimate as a range of days.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups and industry commenters were generally divided over whether servicers should be required to provide information about foreclosure in the written notice, although one industry trade group supported such a requirement. Several industry commenters supported the Bureau's proposal to provide an estimated range of dates for when foreclosure may occur, citing the need to be flexible in light of unforeseen circumstances and the variety of timelines in which a foreclosure could proceed in light of the nature of the property. However, other industry commenters were concerned that including any range may be too inaccurate to provide meaningful guidance to borrowers because of the variety of factors that could influence a foreclosure referral. One large servicer explained that servicers do not typically review accounts for or pursue foreclosure until much later in a borrower's delinquency and that including information about foreclosure could be construed as a threat to take action that is not likely to happen until much later. Another industry commenter and a trade group expressed concern that requiring prospective disclosure of possible foreclosure timelines could lead to litigation if the information turned out to be inaccurate. By contrast, some consumer advocacy groups recommended that the notices should include a narrower foreclosure timeline. Some consumer advocacy groups also believed it was appropriate to make servicers accountable to their estimates, such as by prohibiting servicers from initiating foreclosure earlier than the timeline in the notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and consumer advocacy groups were also divided over whether the estimated foreclosure timeline would undermine the purpose of the early intervention notice. Several industry commenters expressed concern that a foreclosure timeline estimate could confuse borrowers into believing that the referral date is the last day for loss mitigation options whereas help may be available even after the foreclosure referral date. One of these commenters recommended that the Bureau add qualifying language to address concerns that a foreclosure timeline estimate could mislead borrowers into believing they had more time to take action to avoid foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups, on the other hand, believed that a more detailed notice about the foreclosure process could serve an educational function. One consumer advocacy group recommended provision of detailed, State-specific foreclosure timelines tailored to the borrower's residence. One coalition of consumer advocacy groups recommended that the foreclosure statement should provide more explanation of the steps occurring in the foreclosure process, such as a description of court procedures and a sheriff's sale that occur in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions; this group explained that borrowers are often confused about how foreclosure referrals are related to the actual sale of their home. This group of advocates also explained that information when foreclosure will start and end is also important in non-judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, where the foreclosure process can occur quickly and with fewer opportunities for borrowers to object. In addition, this group of advocates recommended that the Bureau should specify a minimum period of time between a missed payment and the date on which foreclosure may begin.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes at the outset that because the Bureau is adopting § 1024.41(f)(1) to delay foreclosure referrals until 120 days after a missed payment, there is less risk of borrower confusion about when foreclosure may begin. Section 1024.41(f)(1) is discussed in more detail below in the applicable section-by-section analysis. Nonetheless, while a single foreclosure deadline would minimize compliance issues around potentially inaccurate estimates, the Bureau is concerned that requiring foreclosure information in the written early intervention notice may cause borrower confusion and may possibly discourage borrowers from seeking early assistance. In addition, an explanation that a servicer will not initiate foreclosure until the 120th day of delinquency may suggest to some borrowers that they cannot submit a loss mitigation application after the initiation of foreclosure, which may not necessarily be the case. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1024.41(g).<footnote ref="148">Section 1024.41(g) generally provides that, if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application after a servicer has made the first foreclosure filing but more than 37 days before a scheduled or anticipated foreclosure sale, a servicer may not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale until a borrower is notified of the borrower's ineligibility for a loss mitigation options, the borrower rejects a loss mitigation offer, or the borrower fails to perform as agreed under an option.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>During consumer testing of the model clauses, participants had a mixed reaction to the foreclosure statement, which included an estimated timeline for when foreclosure may begin. The statement tested a timeline that explained foreclosure could occur 90-150 days after a missed payment. All participants understood before reading the statement that foreclosure was a process through which their lender could take their home if they did not make their mortgage payments.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With respect to the estimated timeline for when foreclosure may begin, some thought that the estimated timeline meant nothing would happen before that date, despite the fact that the clause stated that the process “may begin earlier or later.” While some participants appeared to be motivated to act quickly because of the foreclosure statement, others commented that the estimated timeline implied that it was less important to act immediately because there would be a period of time during which they would be safe from foreclosure. One participant felt strongly that if it were true that the foreclosure process could start in less than 90 days, then the reference to the 90 to 150 day time period should be removed from the clause because it was misleading.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not finalizing the proposed requirement that servicers notify borrowers about foreclosure in the written notice. While the Bureau agrees that the early intervention written notice could serve an educational function with regard to the foreclosure process, the Bureau believes a requirement to notify borrowers about the foreclosure process in the written early intervention notice requires further evaluation by the Bureau because of the risk that such a disclosure could be perceived as confusing or negatively by borrowers, and may discourage some borrowers from reaching out to their servicer promptly. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, during the Small Business Review Panel outreach, some small servicer representatives explained that information about foreclosure is typically not provided until after loss mitigation options have been explored;<footnote ref="149">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Final Report of the Small Business Review Panel on CFPB's Proposals Under Consideration for Mortgage Servicing Rulemaking,&lt;/em&gt; 31 (Jun, 11, 2012).</footnote>
            and during consumer testing, several participants indicated that the tone of the foreclosure statement seemed at odds with the tone of the rest of the clauses encouraging borrowers to resolve their delinquency as soon as possible. Further, the Bureau is concerned that, given the variation in State foreclosure processes, a prescriptive requirement to explain foreclosure may either result in explanations that are too generic to be useful or too complex to be easily understood. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Bureau is removing the proposed requirement that servicers provide information about the foreclosure process in the written early intervention notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not finalizing the requirement for servicers to provide a statement describing foreclosure in the written notice, the Bureau agrees that some borrowers would benefit from receiving information about foreclosure at the time of receiving information about loss mitigation options. Such information could help some borrowers understand their choices they face at the early stages of delinquency. The Bureau believes the requirements to include contact information for housing counselors and servicer personnel assigned under § 1024.40(a) will help address potential information shortcomings of the written notice. Pursuant to § 1024.40(b)(1)(iv), servicers must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicer continuity of contact personnel provide accurate information about the circumstances under which borrowers may be referred to foreclosure. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iv) or model clause MS-4(D), which contained language illustrating the foreclosure statement.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Contact Information for Housing Counselors and State Housing Finance Authorities</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39(b)(vi) would have required the written notice to include contact information for any State housing finance authority for the State in which the borrower's property is located, and contact information for either the Bureau list or the HUD list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With respect to contact information for homeownership counselors or counseling organizations, the Bureau proposed to require similar information pertaining to housing counseling resources that would be required on the ARM interest rate adjustment notice and the periodic statement, as provided in the Bureau's 2012 TILA Mortgage Servicing Proposal.<footnote ref="150">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; proposed Regulation Z &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1026.20(d) and 1026.41(d)(7) in the Bureau's 2012 TILA Mortgage Servicing Proposal.</footnote>
            For these notices, the Bureau did not propose that servicers include a list of specific housing counseling programs or agencies (other than the State housing finance authority, discussed below), but instead that servicers provide contact information for either the Bureau list or the HUD list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations. The Bureau solicited comment on whether the written early intervention notice should include a generic list to access counselors or counseling organizations, as proposed here, or a list of specific counselors or counseling organizations, as was proposed in the 2012 HOEPA Proposal.<footnote ref="151">The 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, which, among other things, implements RESPA section 5(c), which requires lenders to provide applicants of federally related mortgage loans with a “reasonably complete or updated list of homeownership counselors who are certified pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) and located in the area of the lender.” The list provided to applicants pursuant to this requirement will be obtained through a Bureau Web site Bureau or data made available by the Bureau or HUD to comply with this requirement.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau require that servicers provide a list of specific counselors or HUD-certified agencies, citing the need to protect borrowers against so-called “foreclosure rescue” scams, and one organization recommended that the Bureau require servicers to refer borrowers directly to specific counselors upon the borrower's request. Industry commenters expressed support for the proposed requirement to provide generic contact information for borrowers to access a list of counselors. One industry commenter was concerned that requiring servicers to provide a list of counselors would require frequent updating by servicers to ensure the accuracy of the notice. In addition, the commenter was concerned that providing a list of counselors could be construed as the servicer advocating for a particular counselor. One housing counseling organization and an industry commenter explained that some States already require that servicers provide a list of nonprofit housing counseling agencies at the time of sending a written foreclosure notice. The housing counseling organization recommended that the final rule require servicers to provide a list of HUD-approved nonprofit counseling agencies in the written notice, while the industry commenter was concerned about complying with overlapping requirements.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>During the fourth round of consumer testing in Philadelphia, all participants indicated they were likely to take advantage of the contact information contained in the notice, although they indicated they would try to contact their bank first.<footnote ref="152">During consumer testing, participants referred colloquially to their “bank.” The Bureau does not believe this reflects comprehension difficulties with respect to the party borrowers must contact. During testing when asked whether the terms “servicer” and “lender” were identical, participants indicated that they were not.</footnote>
            Several participants said that they would contact HUD<footnote ref="153">Macro tested a statement including HUD's housing counselor list and phone number because, at the time of testing, the Bureau did not have a web site containing this information. The Bureau believes consumers would have the same reaction if the Bureau's contact information were listed instead of HUD's.</footnote>
            or the State housing finance agency<footnote ref="154">At the time of testing, the Bureau tested clauses that included contact information for a State housing finance agency, as the Bureau would have required to be listed under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(vi).</footnote>

            if they were not satisfied with the assistance they got from their bank. One participant indicated that this contact information would be useful to help verify that information provided by the lender was accurate and followed legal guidelines.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the requirement substantially as proposed, renumbered as § 1024.39(b)(2)(v) from § 1024.39(b)(2)(vi). Section 1024.39(b)(2)(v) requires servicers to include in the written notice the Web site to access either the Bureau list or the HUD list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations, and the HUD toll-free telephone number to access homeownership counselors or counseling organizations.<footnote ref="155">The HUD list is available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm&lt;/em&gt; and the HUD toll-free number is 800-569-4287. The Bureau list will be available by the effective date of this final rule at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.consumerfinance.gov/.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            The Bureau is modifying the proposed requirement, which would have required servicers to list either the HUD telephone number or a Bureau telephone number. In the final rule, the Bureau is requiring servicers to list the HUD telephone number but not a Bureau telephone number because the Bureau believes the HUD telephone number that currently exists provides adequate access to approved counseling resources.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted in its proposal, the Bureau believes that delinquent borrowers would benefit from knowing how to access housing counselors because some borrowers may be more comfortable discussing their options with a third-party.<footnote ref="156">Some servicers have found that borrowers may trust independent counseling agencies more than they trust servicers. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Foreclosure Prevention: Improving Contact with Borrowers,&lt;/em&gt; Insights (June 2007) at 6, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.occ.gov/topics/community-affairs/publications/insights/insights-foreclosure-prevention.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            In addition, a housing counselor could provide a borrower with additional information about loss mitigation options that a servicer may not have listed on the written notice. The Bureau also believes the contact information to access the HUD or Bureau list would provide borrowers with access to qualified counselors or counseling organizations that could counsel borrowers about potential foreclosure rescue scams. While the Bureau agrees that borrowers may benefit from a list of specific counseling organizations or counselors, the Bureau also believes that there is value in keeping the content requirements in the written notice flexible to ensure the notice is able to accommodate existing requirements, such as State laws, that may overlap with the Bureau's requirements. The Bureau believes that providing borrowers with the Web site address for either the Bureau or HUD list of homeownership counseling agencies and programs would streamline the disclosure and present clear and concise information for borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition to information about accessing housing counselors, the Bureau proposed to require that the written notice include contact information for the State housing finance authority located in the State in which the property is located. In its proposal, the Bureau sought comment on the costs and benefits of the provision of information about housing counselors and State housing finance authorities to delinquent borrowers in the proposed written notice. The Bureau also sought comment on the potential effect of the Bureau's proposal on access to homeownership counseling generally by borrowers, and the effect of increased borrower demand for counseling on existing counseling resources, including demand on State housing finance authorities.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A State housing finance agency, an association of State housing finance agencies, and a large servicer recommended that the Bureau remove housing finance authority contact information from the written notice, citing resource limitations of State housing finance authorities. The large servicer expressed concern that borrowers would blame their servicer for directing them to State housing finance agencies that proved unable to provide assistance, or that such an experience would discourage borrowers from seeking other assistance. Two industry commenters also recommended that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to provide State housing finance authority contact information, citing the tracking burden associated with this requirement. One commenter explained that a phone number to access housing counselors (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> through a HUD or Bureau phone number or Web site) would provide borrowers with sufficient access to assistance. As an alternative, the industry commenter suggested that the Bureau host this information or that the Bureau simply include language that there may be State-sponsored programs in the borrower's State that could be helpful. Another servicer recommended that the written notice simply reference that assistance may be available through the State Housing Finance Authority and provide a telephone number that borrowers could call to learn more about them.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is omitting the proposed requirement to disclose State housing finance authority contact information in the written notice because the Bureau shares the concern of the State housing finance authorities that directing borrowers to specific State agencies may overwhelm their limited resources. The Bureau also understands that not all State housing finance authorities offer counseling services, which may cause confusion among delinquent borrowers directed to such entities. In addition, the Bureau believes providing contact information for housing counselors or counseling organizations through access to a HUD or Bureau Web site or telephone number will ensure borrowers have access to assistance. Accordingly, the Bureau is amending proposed paragraph (b)(2)(vi) to contain no subparagraphs and is renumbering it as paragraph (b)(2)(v) in light of the deletion of the proposed foreclosure statement. In addition, the Bureau is deleting the portion of model clause MS-4(E) containing language about State housing finance authorities.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>39(c) Conflicts With Other Law</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As noted above, industry commenters were concerned that the Bureau's proposed early intervention requirements could conflict with existing law. Several commenters requested guidance on whether servicers would be required to comply with the early intervention requirements if the borrower instructed the servicer to cease collection efforts, not to contact the borrower by telephone, or that the borrower refuses to pay the debt. Several of these commenters requested that the Bureau include an exemption in cases involving debt collection or bankruptcy law. One industry commenter requested that the Bureau clarify whether servicers would have immunity from claims of harassment or improper conduct under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>To address concerns about conflicts with other law, the Bureau has added subsection (c) to § 1024.39 to provide that nothing in § 1024.39 shall require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner otherwise prohibited under applicable law. The Bureau has added this provision to clarify that the Bureau does not intend for its early intervention requirements to require servicers to take any action that may be prohibited under State law, such as a statutory foreclosure regime that may prohibit certain types of contact with borrowers that may be required under § 1024.39. The Bureau has also added this provision to clarify that servicers are not required to make contact with borrowers in a manner that may be prohibited by Federal laws, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provisions. The Bureau has also added comment 39(c)-1 to address borrowers in bankruptcy. Comment 39(c)-1 provides that § 1024.39 does not require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case; and that, to the extent permitted by such law or court order, servicers may adapt the requirements of § 1024.39 in any manner that would permit them to notify borrowers of loss mitigation options. Through this comment the Bureau has not sought to interpret the Bankruptcy Code, but instead intended to indicate that servicers may take a flexible approach to complying with § 1024.39 in order to provide information on loss mitigation options to borrowers in bankruptcy to the extent permitted by applicable law or court order.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1024.39 Early Intervention Requirements for Certain Borrowers</title>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Background</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.39 would have required servicers to provide delinquent borrowers with two notices. First, proposed § 1024.39(a), would have required servicers to notify or make good faith efforts to notify a borrower orally that the borrower's payment is late and that loss mitigation options may be available, if applicable. Servicers would have been required to take this action not later than 30 days after the payment due date, unless the borrower satisfied the payment during that period. Second, proposed § 1024.39(b) would have required servicers to provide a written notice with information about the foreclosure process, housing counselors and the borrower's State housing finance authority, and, if applicable, information about loss mitigation options that may be available to the borrower. Servicers would have been required to provide the written notice not later than 40 days after the payment due date, unless the borrower satisfied the payment during that period. These two notices were designed primarily to encourage delinquent borrowers to work with their servicer to identify their options for avoiding foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>While a number of industry commenters supported the overall objective of encouraging communication between servicers and delinquent borrowers, many commenters, particularly small servicers, requested that the Bureau not issue regulations that are not required by the express provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, citing compliance burden and the potential for overwhelming and confusing borrowers. Some industry commenters were concerned that the breadth of the definition of “Loss mitigation options” would require servicers to offer options or take actions inconsistent with investor or guarantor requirements. One industry commenter suggested, as an alternative to early intervention, that all borrowers be required to receive education about mortgages earlier in the process, before they become delinquent. Another stated that the Bureau's early intervention requirements would be ineffective because borrowers would not open mail or respond to phone calls.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups were uniformly in favor of both an oral and written notice requirement. One consumer advocacy group explained that an oral and written notice requirement would help homeowners identify late payments quickly and engage in loss mitigation earlier to avoid foreclosure. Several consumer advocacy groups who submitted a joint comment stated that the Bureau was justified in proposing early intervention, explaining that early intervention is already an industry norm under GSE guidelines, the National Mortgage Settlement, and HAMP, which have standards for multiple phone calls and written notices at the early stages of a delinquency. These commenters also cited research that showed borrowers have a lower re-default rate the earlier they are reached in their delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, most consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau require servicers to provide more information about the foreclosure process and loss mitigation options than the Bureau had proposed to require. Many consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau require servicers to provide information about all loss mitigation options potentially available to borrowers through the proposed oral and written notices. One mortgage investor commenter supported the Bureau's policy goal of requiring servicers to engage more actively with delinquent borrowers about loss mitigation options. This commenter also recommended that the final rule require that servicers maintain adequate staffing levels with respect to delinquent loans, maintain frequent contact with borrowers to remind borrowers of available options, review them for such options, and provide a user-friendly and up-to-date Web site on which borrowers could locate servicer contact information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters questioned whether the Bureau's rules were necessary in light of recent State and Federal remediation efforts, such as the National Mortgage Settlement and various consent agreements with bank regulators. One credit union trade association believed that the Bureau's proposed requirements were too rigid and would be ineffective, while another indicated that the early intervention requirements would not present issues because many of its affiliated members would be able to modify their current procedures without much difficulty. However, other industry trade associations and a nonprofit servicer indicated that, while most servicers already perform some form of early intervention, their programs are not identical to the Bureau's proposal, and that compliance would require adjustments to or formalization of servicer policies and procedures that may not necessarily be suited to a borrower's particular circumstances. Several industry commenters expressed concern that the Bureau's rules overlap and could conflict with existing State and Federal law.<footnote ref="122">For example, one credit union trade association identified a Michigan law that generally requires that, before a foreclosing party proceeds to foreclosure, it must provide borrowers with a notice containing information about foreclosure avoidance options and housing counselors. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Mich. Comp. Laws 600.3205a.</footnote>
            With respect to addressing potential conflicts between the Bureau's rules and existing State and Federal law as well as existing industry practice, commenters identified a variety of ways the Bureau could provide relief, including by not adopting rules that exceed or otherwise conflict with existing requirements, providing safe harbors (such as by clarifying that compliance with existing laws and agreements satisfies 1024.39), adopting more flexible standards, providing exemptions, including a mechanism in the rule to resolve compliance conflicts, or broadly preempting State laws.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Trade associations, smaller servicers, credit unions, and rural creditors subject to Farm Credit Administration rules generally requested exemptions from the early intervention requirements, citing a “high-touch” customer service model, problems with internalizing compliance costs relative to larger servicers, and potential conflicts arising from complying with conflicting sets of rules. Small servicers and credit unions expressed concern that higher compliance costs would make it difficult to maintain high levels of customer service.<footnote ref="123">One nonprofit servicer requested that the Bureau clarify how the early intervention requirements would apply if, as the Bureau proposed, small servicers are exempt from the periodic statement requirement in Regulation Z.</footnote>
            A reverse mortgage trade association requested an exemption from the early intervention requirements because of the unique nature of reverse mortgage products and because the majority of reverse mortgages made in the current market are FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgages already subject to specific requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments submitted but continues to believe that rules governing early intervention are warranted. As the Bureau explained in its proposal, the Bureau believes that a servicer's delinquency management plays a significant role in whether the borrower cures the delinquency or ends up in foreclosure.<footnote ref="124">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Diane Thompson, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Foreclosing Modifications: How Servicer Incentives Discourage Loan Modifications,&lt;/em&gt; 86 Wash.

            For a variety of reasons, at least among the larger players, servicers have not been consistent in managing delinquent accounts to provide borrowers with an opportunity to avoid foreclosure. In addition, incentives remain that may discourage these larger servicers from addressing a delinquency quickly as servicers may profit from late fees.<footnote ref="125">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., The Need for National Mortgage Servicing Standards: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Hous., Transp., &amp;amp; Comm.

L. Rev. 755 (2011). The Bureau is aware that the GSEs and other programs, such as HAMP, align servicer incentives to encourage early intervention. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Fannie Mae, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Single-Family Servicing Guide,&lt;/em&gt; Part VII &amp;#167; 602.04.05 (2012); Freddie Mac, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide,&lt;/em&gt; Volume 2, Ch. 65.42 (2012); U.S. Dep't of Treasury &amp;amp; U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp;amp; Urban Dev., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Making Home Affordable Program Handbook,&lt;/em&gt; 106 (December 15, 2011). Through this rulemaking, the Bureau intends to make early intervention a uniform minimum national standard and part of established servicer practice.</footnote>
            The Bureau also explained that delinquent borrowers may not make contact with servicers to discuss their options because they may be unaware that they have options<footnote ref="126">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., Are There Government Barriers to the Housing Recovery?

            There is risk to borrowers who do not make contact with servicers and remain delinquent; the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure.<footnote ref="128">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; John C.

            By requiring early intervention with delinquent borrowers, the Bureau has sought to correct impediments to borrower-servicer communication so that borrowers have a reasonable opportunity to avoid foreclosure at the early stages of a delinquency. As the Bureau recognized in its proposal, not all delinquent borrowers may respond to servicer outreach or pursue available loss mitigation options. However, the Bureau believes that the notices will ensure, at a minimum, that covered borrowers have an opportunity to do so at the early stages of a delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule implements, among other things, RESPA section 5(c) requiring lenders to provide applicants of federally related mortgage loans with a list of homeownership counseling providers. Thus, borrowers will receive information to access counseling services at the time of application. In addition, the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule requires that applicants for “high cost” mortgages receive counseling prior to obtaining credit. While pre-mortgage counseling will help ensure borrowers understand the costs involved in obtaining a mortgage, borrowers who become delinquent may not know that they have options for avoiding foreclosure unless the servicer notifies them.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that private lenders and investors, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Federal agencies, such as FHA and VA, already have early intervention servicing standards in place for delinquent borrowers.<footnote ref="129">HUD and the VA have promulgated regulations and issued guidance on servicing practices for loans guaranteed or insured by their programs. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 24 CFR 203 subpart C (HUD); U.S. Hous. &amp;amp; Urban Dev., Handbook 4330.1 rev-5, Ch. 7; 38 CFR Ch. 1 pt. 36, Subpt.

Fannie Mae &amp;amp; Freddie Mac have established recommended servicing practices for delinquent borrowers in their servicing guidelines and align their modification incentives with the number of days the mortgage loan is delinquent when the borrower enters a trial period plan. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Fannie Mae, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Single-Family Servicing Guide,&lt;/em&gt; 700-1 (2012); Fannie Mae, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Outbound Call Attempts Guidelines&lt;/em&gt; (Oct. 1, 2011), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at https://www.efanniemae.com/home/index.jsp&lt;/em&gt; ; Fannie Mae, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Letters and Notice Guidelines&lt;/em&gt; (Apr. 25, 2012), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at https://www.efanniemae.com/home/index.jsp&lt;/em&gt; ; Freddie Mac, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. 2, Ch. 64-69 (2012).</footnote>
            However, servicers may vary as to how forthcoming they are in providing borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments with options other than to pay only what is owed. The Bureau's goal with respect to its early intervention requirements is to identify consumer protection standards that are now best practices but were not consistently applied during the recent financial crisis and to apply these across the market, subject to exemptions identified in § 1024.30(b) and the scope limitation of § 1024.30(c)(2), to ensure that servicers are providing delinquent borrowers with a meaningful opportunity to avoid foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of comments received on the proposal, the Bureau has revised the proposed early intervention requirements to provide servicers with additional flexibility. Proposed § 1024.39(a) would have required servicers to notify, or make good faith efforts to notify, delinquent borrowers orally that loss mitigation options, if applicable, may be available by the 30th day of their delinquency. Under the proposal, servicers that make loss mitigation options available to borrowers would generally have been required to notify delinquent borrowers of the availability of such options not later than the 30th day of their delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule does not require servicers to provide this notice to all borrowers and does not require servicers to inform borrowers of options that are not available from the owner or investor. Instead, under § 1024.39(a), servicers must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with a delinquent borrower by the 36th day of the borrower's delinquency. Live contact includes telephoning or conducting an in-person meeting with the borrower. In addition, under § 1024.39(a), promptly after establishing live contact, servicers must inform the borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options if appropriate. Among other changes, the final rule includes commentary that clarifies that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether such a notice is appropriate under the circumstances. Commentary to the final rule also provides a more flexible good faith efforts standard that would permit servicers to comply by encouraging the borrower through written or electronic communication to make contact with the servicer. These changes are intended to help ensure servicers make efforts to contact delinquent borrowers who would be interested in learning about loss mitigation options and, at the same time, avoid causing servicers to spend resources notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options the servicer has reason to believe would not benefit from being informed of such options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule includes a written notice requirement similar to the one proposed at § 1024.39(b), but the Bureau has sought to mitigate compliance burden without undermining the protection of an early written notice by extending the deadline for providing the notice from 40 to 45 days of a borrower's delinquency to align with other notices that servicers may already provide to borrowers at that time. The Bureau has sought to develop flexible early intervention requirements to accommodate existing practices and requirements to avoid servicers having to duplicate existing early intervention practices. For example, if servicers are required by other laws to provide a notice that includes the content required by § 1024.39(b)(2) and if servicers may provide such notice within the first 45 days of a borrower's delinquency, the Bureau does not believe servicers would need to provide each notice separately.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has further sought to accommodate existing practices by providing clarifying commentary to § 1024.39(b)(1) that servicers may combine notices that may already meet the content requirements of § 1024.39(b)(2) into a single mailing. In addition, comment 39(b)(2)-1 explains that the written notice contains minimum content requirements for the written notice and that a servicer may provide additional information that the servicer determines would be helpful or which may be required by applicable law or the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan. The Bureau has included this comment, in part, to accommodate similar notices that servicers may already be providing. Further, to assist with compliance, the Bureau has also developed model clauses, which the Bureau has tested with the assistance of Macro. A servicer's appropriate use of the model clauses will act as a safe harbor for compliance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau has designed its early intervention requirements to provide flexibility to servicers that already have early intervention practices in place or that are complying with external existing requirements, the Bureau acknowledges that some of the new requirements may not align perfectly with all existing practices. To address actual conflicts with State or Federal law, the Bureau has included new § 1024.39(c), which, as discussed in more detail below, provides that nothing in § 1024.39 shall require a servicer to make contact with a borrower in a manner that would be prohibited under applicable law. The Bureau believes this approach to conflicting laws is preferable to preempting other laws. Because § 1024.39 require servicers to proactively contact borrowers, the Bureau is concerned that preempting laws might override those that protect delinquent borrowers from certain contacts (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> debt collection laws).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is granting exemptions for small servicers as defined in 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4); servicers with respect to any reverse mortgage transaction as that term is defined in § 1024.31; and servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(b) above. The Bureau is further limiting the application of §§ 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30(c)(2) above.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not mandating that servicers maintain specific staffing levels to perform early intervention with delinquent borrowers, but the Bureau notes that, under § 1024.38, servicers must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of properly evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options. The Bureau is not requiring servicers to maintain a Web site for delinquent borrowers to provide early intervention information because the Bureau believes such a requirement may be burdensome for all servicers and is unnecessary in light of the written notice at § 1024.39(b), which includes contact information for servicer continuity of contact personnel assigned pursuant to § 1024.40(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to grant an exemption from the early intervention requirements with respect to borrowers who have ceased making payments for the past six months and have not contacted their servicer. To the extent loss mitigation options are available for such borrowers, the Bureau believes these borrowers should be so informed in accordance with § 1024.39(a) and (b). Further, the Bureau believes servicers should make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers who may be reluctant to reach out before taking action that may result in the loss of the borrower's home. In addition, the Bureau believes these borrowers would benefit from information about how to contact their servicer as well as information about how to access housing counseling resources.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>Legal Authority</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to implement § 1024.39 pursuant to authority under sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a) of RESPA. Violations of section 6 of RESPA are subject to a private right of action. Industry commenters, including the GSEs, industry trade associations, and several large bank servicers were concerned that a private right of action would result in uncertainty for servicers and could delay loss mitigation efforts and the foreclosure process if a borrower claimed it did not receive a timely notice required by the Bureau's rules. Commenters indicated that increased litigation costs would limit access to and increase the cost of credit to borrowers. One commenter was concerned that a private right of action would result in loss mitigation being perceived as a substantive right. Instead, commenters requested that the Bureau issue the early intervention and other loss mitigation provisions solely in reliance on RESPA section 19(a) authority.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered industry comments but continues to rely on RESPA section 6 authority as a basis for the Bureau's early intervention requirements under § 1024.39. The Bureau does not believe § 1024.39 will result in loss mitigation being treated as a substantive right because it sets forth procedural requirements only. As finalized, § 1024.39 does not require servicers to offer any particular loss mitigation option to any particular borrower. The live contact requirement under § 1024.39(a) requires servicers to notify borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options “if appropriate”; associated commentary clarifies that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether it is appropriate to inform borrowers of such options. The written notice requirement under § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) requires servicers to inform borrowers, “if applicable,” of examples of loss mitigation options available through the servicer. Nothing in § 1024.39 affects whether a borrower is permitted as a matter of contract law to enforce the terms of any contract or agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has taken steps to clarify requirements in the rule, which the Bureau believes will help avoid uncertainty for servicers and help minimize litigation risk and compliance costs arising from a private right of action associated with RESPA section 6. For example, the final rule omits the proposed oral notice requirement under proposed § 1024.39(a) and instead requires that servicers establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers and, promptly after establishing live contact, inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options “if appropriate.” Comment 39(a)-3.i explains that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether informing a borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances; the comment also includes illustrative examples to assist with compliance. While this guidance should provide servicers with some degree of certainty around compliance, the Bureau recognizes there may be limited situations that are less clear; in these cases, however, servicers could avoid compliance risk by informing borrowers of loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.ii explains that a servicer may inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options either through an oral or written communication. The final rule also provides servicers with more flexibility in satisfying the good faith efforts standard; servicers may demonstrate compliance by providing written or electronic communication encouraging borrowers to establish live contact with their servicer. In addition, with respect to the written notice under § 1024.39(b), the final rule includes model clauses and clarifies in commentary that servicers may provide additional information about loss mitigation options not included in the model clauses. Further, the final rule includes flexible minimum content requirements for the written notice that will assist servicers in accommodating existing disclosures and other related disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the risk of a private right of action will negatively impact access to, or cost of, credit. The requirements under § 1024.39 include clear procedural requirements as well as protections for a servicer's exercise of reasonable discretion. Further, the requirements have been implemented to reduce compliance burden and provide clear rules capable of efficient implementation by servicers, including through the use of model clauses. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the early intervention rules under § 1024.39 provide necessary consumer protections and that servicers are capable of providing such protections without negative consequences for borrowers, including with respect to access to, or cost of, credit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.39 pursuant to its authorities under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA. As explained in more detail below, the Bureau finds, consistent with RESPA section 6(k)(1)(E), that § 1024.39 is appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to help borrowers avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees and to facilitate review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. For the same reasons, § 1024.39 is authorized under section 6(j)(3) of RESPA as necessary to carry out section 6 of RESPA, and under section 19(a) of RESPA as necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including borrowers' avoidance of unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees and the facilitation of review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting § 1024.39 pursuant to its authority under section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial laws, including the purposes and objectives of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the Bureau believes that § 1024.39 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objectives under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information to make responsible decisions about financial transactions, and markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances. Consistent with section 1032(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the model clauses at appendix MS-4 have been validated through consumer testing.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Proposed 40(a)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) would have provided that no later than five days after a servicer has notified or made a good faith effort to notify a borrower to the extent required by proposed § 1024.39(a), the servicer must assign personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries, and as applicable, assist the borrower with loss mitigation options. Proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) further provided that if a borrower has been assigned personnel as required by § 1024.40(a)(1) and the assignment has not ended when servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan has transferred to a transferee servicer, subject to § 1024.40(c)(1) through (4), the transferee servicer must assign personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries, and as applicable, assist the borrower with loss mitigation options, within a reasonable time of the transfer of servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan. In support of the continuity of contact requirements with respect to the transfer of a borrower's mortgage loan, the Bureau reasoned that the transfer of a borrower's mortgage loan from one servicer to another should not negatively impact the borrower's pursuit of loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 would have explained that for purposes of responding to borrower inquiries and assisting the borrower with loss mitigation options, the term “borrower” includes a person whom the borrower has authorized to act on behalf of the borrower (a borrower's agent), and may include, for example, a housing counselor or attorney. The comment would have further explained that servicers may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if such person has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 reflects the Bureau's understanding that some delinquent borrowers may authorize third parties to assist them as they pursue alternatives to foreclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau sought to clarify that a servicer's obligation in proposed § 1024.40 extends to persons authorized to act on behalf of the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-2 would have clarified that for purposes of § 1024.40(a)(1), a reasonable time for a transferee servicer to assign personnel to a borrower is by the end of the 30-day period of the transfer of servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-2 reflects the Bureau's belief that a transferee servicer may require some time after the transfer of servicing to identify delinquent borrowers who had personnel assigned to them by the transferor servicer. The Bureau believed that 30 days is a reasonable amount of time for a transferee servicer to assign personnel to a borrower whose mortgage loan has been transferred to the servicer through a servicing transfer. The Bureau invited comments on whether a longer time frame is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i. would have explained that a servicer has discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented and reflected the Bureau's belief that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating the mortgage servicing industry may not be optimal, and thus servicers should be given flexibility to implement proposed § 1024.40 in the manner best suited to their particular circumstances. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.ii would have explained that § 1024.40(a)(1) requires servicers to assign personnel to borrowers whom servicers are required to notify pursuant to § 1024.39(a). If a borrower whom a servicer is not required to notify pursuant to § 1024.39(a) contacts the servicer to explain that he or she expects to be late in making a particular payment, the comment would have explained that the servicer may assign personnel to the borrower upon its own initiative. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-4 would have explained that proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) does not permit or require a servicer to take any action inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case to avoid any potential conflict between the continuity of contact requirements and the automatic stay. The Bureau, however, invited comment on whether servicers should be required to continue providing delinquent borrowers continuity of contact after borrowers have filed for bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.40(a)(2) to require a servicer to make access to the assigned personnel available via telephone. If a borrower contacted the servicer and did not receive a live response from the assigned personnel, proposed § 1024.40(a)(2) would have required that the borrower be able to record his or her contact information and that the servicer respond to the borrower within a reasonable time. Proposed comment 40(a)(2)-1 would have provided that for purposes of § 1024.40(a)(2), three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable time to respond. The Bureau intended comment 40(a)(2)-1 to function as a safe harbor because the Bureau believed in most cases, it would be reasonable to expect that borrowers receive a response within the proposed time frame. The Bureau invited comments on whether the Bureau should provide for a longer response time.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, consumer groups generally supported the Bureau's proposed continuity of contact requirements, but industry commenters urged the Bureau to make changes in various ways. With respect to proposed § 1024.40(a)(1), industry commenters overwhelmingly opposed the requirement that would have required a servicer to make contact personnel available to any borrower five days after a servicer has orally notified such borrower about the borrower's late payment in accordance with proposed § 1024.39(a). Commenters asserted that tying the assignment of contact staff to the oral notification requirement might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance because in most cases, borrowers who are delinquent for 30 days or less self-cure. The commenters additionally asserted that the diversion of resources would adversely impact borrowers who actually need loss mitigation assistance by diverting servicer resources unnecessarily. One state credit union association suggested that there might be implementation challenges because servicers' current systems might not be set up to assign personnel based on a borrower's payment status.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested alternative methods of assignment that they asserted would be more effective: (1) Delay assignment until borrowers become at least 45 days delinquent (the range was between 45 and 60 days); (2) permit servicers to rely on their internal policies and procedures to determine the timing of assignment; (3) require servicers to assign contact personnel to borrowers who request loss mitigation assistance, which could be demonstrated by either submitting a loss mitigation application or the first piece of documentation a servicer has requested from a borrower with respect to a loss mitigation application. Industry commenters who suggested the last alternative observed that limiting a servicer's obligation to assign contact personnel would be consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and thus would make compliance with the Bureau's proposed rule less costly to servicers who have already implemented systems changes to comply with the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to comments received on proposed § 1024.40(a)(2), one non-bank servicer expressed concern about whether proposed § 1024.40(a)(2) would have required servicers to track voicemail messages left in the voicemail box of individual staff members and urged the Bureau to change the requirement such that borrowers are transferred to available live representatives or require servicers to call borrowers back within some set amount of time. With respect to proposed comment 40(a)(2)-1, one national non-profit organization urged the Bureau to provide that a servicer may take five days to respond because it saw the three-day response time as a requirement that it could not meet because it is mostly staffed by volunteers. A non-bank servicer requested clarification whether the three-day response time is guidance or a requirement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Final 1024.40(a)</title>
                <analysisParagraph>For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1024.40 as a requirement that servicers maintain a set of policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve specified objectives. Accordingly, the Bureau is withdrawing § 1024.40(a)(1) and (2) because they are proposed as specific requirements. But, the objectives the Bureau is adopting in § 1024.40(a) largely draw from the specific requirements concerning assignment of personnel in proposed § 1024.40(a), unless otherwise noted below. As adopted, § 1024.40(a) requires a servicer to maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the following objectives: (1) Assign personnel to a delinquent borrower by the time a servicer provides such borrower with the written notice required in § 1024.39(b), but in any event, not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency; (2) make available to such borrower, via telephone, the assigned personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries and, as applicable, assist the borrower with available loss mitigation options until the borrower has made two consecutive mortgage payments in accordance with the terms of a permanent loss mitigation agreement without incurring a late charge; and (3) ensure that the servicer can provide a live response to a delinquent borrower who contacts the assigned personnel but does not immediately receive a live response.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After carefully considering industry commenters' concern that tying the assignment of contact personnel to the oral notification requirement in proposed § 1024.39(a) might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance, the Bureau has decided to delay the timing of the assignment of contact personnel to the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency, unless the servicer provides the written notice required by § 1024.39(b) beforehand. The Bureau believes that this change adequately addresses the concern of industry commenters that the proposal might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance. To the extent a servicer becomes obligated to assign contact personnel to a borrower before such borrower becomes 45-days delinquent, it would be because the servicer has determined that such borrower should be informed of the availability of loss mitigation options before day 45.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to make assignment and availability of contact personnel contingent on a borrower making a request for loss mitigation assistance. The Bureau believes that servicers have more information about the qualifications for various loss mitigation options than borrowers, and accordingly, the Bureau believes it is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA to require servicers to engage a borrower in communication that would facilitate reviewing a borrower for foreclosure avoidance options. The Bureau also disagrees that servicers would be unduly burdened by a continuity of contact provision that does not exactly align with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement. The Bureau observes that the National Mortgage Settlement requires a servicer to identify the contact personnel to a borrower after a borrower has requested assistance. The Bureau is not requiring that a servicer provide borrowers with identifying information about the contact personnel, just that contact personnel be available to borrowers to whom a servicer has provided loss mitigation information to answer borrower inquiries and assist borrowers with loss mitigation options, as applicable. The Bureau believes the Bureau's requirement is less burdensome than the terms and conditions of the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has made changes to proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 in response to general concerns expressed by several industry commenters about communicating with persons other than a borrower with respect to error resolution, information requests, and during the loss mitigation process. Industry commenters asserted that it would be costly to servicers to verify whether such persons are in fact authorized to act on a borrower's behalf. They also expressed concern regarding potential liability for inadvertent release of confidential information and violation of applicable privacy laws.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that requiring servicers to provide continuity of contact personnel to borrowers' agents is more costly than limiting the requirement to borrowers. The Bureau believes, however, that borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or in dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau believes that it is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA to permit such agents to communicate with the servicer on a borrower's behalf.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 is adopted as comment 40(a)-1 to clarify that a servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person who claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf and that such reasonable policies and procedures may require that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. The Bureau believes that this clarification adequately balances the duty of servicers to communicate with third parties authorized by delinquent borrowers to act on their behalf in pursuing alternatives to foreclosure and the compliance cost and potential liability asserted by industry commenters and described above. Further, the Bureau notes that this comment is similar to commentary appearing in §§ 1024.35, 36, and 39.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In adopting § 1024.40(a), the Bureau has added to comment 40(a)-1 clarification of what the term “delinquent borrower” means for purposes of § 1024.40(a). Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes it would be better to state clearly in § 1024.40(a) that the continuity of contact requirements in § 1024.40 only apply to delinquent borrower rather than setting forth a separate section in proposed § 1024.40(c) to the same effect. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 1024.40(c) and is instead moving the substance of proposed § 1024.40(c), which the Bureau has modified for reasons set forth below, into commentary as part of comment 40(a)-1 to explain the term “delinquent borrower.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i as comment 40(a)-2. Two GSEs and a credit union commenter asked the Bureau to move the clarification in proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i that a servicer may assign a team of persons to assist a borrower as required by proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) from commentary to rule text. The Bureau declines because the proposed clarification is an example of how a servicer may exercise discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate that the clarification remains in the commentary.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As adopted, comment 40(a)-2 additionally provides that a servicer may assign single-purpose or multi-purpose personnel. Single-purpose personnel are personnel whose primary responsibility is to respond to a delinquent borrower who meets the assignment criteria described in § 1024.40(a)(1). Multi-purpose personnel can be personnel that do not have a primary responsibility at all, or personnel for whom responding to a borrower who meet the assignment criteria set forth in § 1024.40(a)(1) is not the personnel's primary responsibility. The Bureau added this clarification to address comments by industry commenters expressing concern that some servicers do not have the capacity to dedicate staff members to assisting borrowers with loss mitigation options to the exclusion of other responsibilities. Comment 40(a)-2 further explains that when a borrower who meets the assignment criteria of § 1024.40(a) has filed for bankruptcy, a servicer may assign personnel with specialized knowledge in bankruptcy law to assist such borrowers in response to questions raised by industry commenters about whether the Bureau's continuity of contact requirement would allow servicers to reassign a borrower who has filed for bankruptcy to personnel with specialized knowledge and training in bankruptcy law. Because the Bureau is adopting this clarification in comment 40(a)-2, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-4, which, as explained above, was proposed to clarify the relationship between proposed § 1024.40 and bankruptcy law to address situations in which servicers transfer the borrower's file to a separate unit of personnel (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> personnel who are not part of the servicer's loss mitigation unit), or to outside bankruptcy counsel to comply with bankruptcy law). The Bureau is also not adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.ii because the final rule no longer ties the assignment of contact personnel to a servicer's provision of the oral notice that would have been required pursuant to proposed § 1024.39(a).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) would have required a transferee servicer to assign contact personnel to a borrower if the borrower had been assigned personnel by the transferor servicer, and the assignment had not ended at the time of the borrower's mortgage loan had been transferred. The Bureau became concerned that transferee servicers may try to evade compliance with the obligation to provide continuity of contact by asserting that this obligation is contingent upon whether the borrower has been assigned contact personnel by the transferor servicer. The Bureau believes that preventing a servicer's evasion of its continuity of contact obligation is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. The Bureau believes that finalized § 1024.40(a) makes it clear that a servicer's obligation to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to assign contact personnel to certain delinquent borrowers is not contingent upon whether the borrower was assigned such personnel by the borrower's previous servicer.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Proposed 40(b)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) to require a servicer to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer personnel the servicer makes available to the borrower pursuant to proposed § 1024.40(a) perform certain functions that the Bureau believed would facilitate servicers' review of a borrower for loss mitigation options. The functions would have been as follows: (1) Providing a borrower with accurate information about loss mitigation options offered by the servicer and available to the borrower based on information in the servicer's possession (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(A)), actions a borrower must take to be evaluated for loss mitigation options, including what the borrower must do to submit a complete loss mitigation application, as defined in proposed § 1024.41, and if applicable, what the borrower must do to appeal the servicer's denial of the borrower's application (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(B)), the status of the borrower's already-submitted loss mitigation application (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(C)), the circumstances under which a servicer must make a foreclosure referral (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(D)), and loss mitigation deadlines the servicer has established (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(E)); (2) accessing a complete record of the borrower's payment history in the servicer's possession, all documents the borrower has submitted to the servicer in connection with the borrower's application for a loss mitigation option offered by the servicer, and if applicable, documents the borrower has submitted to prior servicers in connection with the borrower's application for loss mitigation options offered by those servicers, to the extent that those documents are in the servicer's possession (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(A through (C)); (3) providing the documents in § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(B) through (C) to persons authorized to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options offered by the servicer if the servicer personnel assigned to the borrower is not authorized to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(iii)); and (4) within a reasonable time after a borrower request, provide the information to the borrower or inform the borrower of the telephone number and address the servicer has established for borrowers to assert an error pursuant to § 1024.35 or make an information request pursuant to § 1024.36 (proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(iv)). Proposed comment 40(b)(1)(iv) would have clarified that for purposes of § 1024.40(b)(1)(iv), three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable time to provide the information the borrower has requested or inform the borrower of the telephone number and address the servicer has established for borrowers to assert an error pursuant to § 1024.35 or make an information request pursuant to § 1024.36.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) reflected the Bureau's belief that having staff available to help delinquent borrowers is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that when a borrower at a significant risk of default reaches out to a servicer for assistance, the borrower is connected to personnel who can address the borrower's inquiries or loss mitigation requests adequately. The staff a servicer makes available to delinquent borrowers must be able to perform functions that are calibrated toward, among other things, facilitating the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Further, as discussed in the proposal, § 1024.40 was intended to work together with proposed §§ 1024.39 and 1024.41. For example, proposed § 1024.41 would have required a servicer to notify a borrower if the borrower has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application. Proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) would have addressed this duty by requiring the personnel assigned to the borrower to inform the borrower about the steps the borrower must take to complete his or her loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau additionally proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) based on the recognition that mortgage investors and other regulators have responded to breakdowns in borrower-servicer communication by requiring servicers to adopt staffing standards. The Bureau believed that the functions set forth in proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) would have complemented existing standards. The Bureau did not receive comments in response to proposed § 1024.40(b)(1), with the exception that two national consumer groups questioned whether proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would unnecessarily dilute a transferor servicer' responsibility to ensure it transfers all relevant borrower information and a transferee servicer's responsibility to ensure that it take possession of all such information because proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would have limited the transferred documents to ones in a transferee servicer's possession. The consumer groups also questioned whether § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would have conflicted with proposed § 1024.38(b)(4), which would have required servicers to transfer all of the information and documents relating to a transferred mortgage loan. The Bureau observes that the limitation was proposed because the Bureau did not believe a transferee servicer should be exposed to potentially costly litigation if the lack of access to documents is due to the fault of the transferor servicer. The Bureau observes that several of the proposed objectives with respect to providing information or accessing information would have been limited to circumstances where the information was in the servicer's possession. This proposed limitation was intended to be a safeguard to help servicers manage costs arising from the litigation risk that would have been created by the existence of civil liability for violations of proposed § 1024.40. But because the Bureau has decided to finalize § 1024.40 such that there will be no private liability for violations of the provision, the Bureau is not adopting the safeguard.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.40(b)(2) would have provided that a servicer's policies and procedures satisfy the requirements in § 1024.40(b)(1) if servicer personnel do not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to perform the functions set forth in § 1024.40(b)(1) where applicable. Proposed comment 40(b)(2)-1.i would have provided that for purposes of § 1024.40(b)(2), a servicer exhibits a pattern or practice of failing to perform such functions, with respect to a single borrower, if servicer personnel assigned to the borrower fail to perform any of the functions listed in § 1024.40(b)(1) where applicable on multiple occasions, such as, for example, repeatedly providing the borrower with inaccurate information about the status of the loss mitigation application the borrower has submitted. Proposed comment 40(b)(2)-1.ii would have explained that a servicer exhibits a pattern or practice of failing to perform such functions, with respect to a large number of borrowers, if servicer personnel assigned to the borrowers fail to perform any of the functions listed in § 1024.40(b)(1) in similar ways, such as, for example, providing a large number of borrowers with inaccurate information about the status of the loss mitigation applications the borrowers have submitted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that contact personnel may occasionally make a mistake and fail to perform a function enumerated in proposed § 1024.40(b)(1). Proposed § 1024.40(b)(2) reflects the Bureau's belief that the occasional mistake is not necessarily indicative of servicers not complying with the servicing obligation set forth in proposed § 1024.40(b)(1). Accordingly, just as the Bureau proposed the safe harbor in proposed § 1024.38(a)(2) for servicers for non-systemic violations of § 1024.38 to manage the costs arising from the litigation risk created by the existence of civil liability for violations of § 1024.38, the Bureau proposed a safe harbor in proposed § 1024.40(b)(2) for servicers for non-systemic violations of § 1024.40(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Both consumer groups and industry commenters opposed the safe harbor the Bureau proposed in § 1024.40(b)(2). Just as consumer groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the proposed safe harbor in proposed § 1024.38(a)(2) to reduce barriers to successful litigation and to ensure that the rule provides protection for more borrowers, they urged the Bureau to withdraw proposed § 1024.40(b)(2). Just as industry groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the pattern or practice private cause of action under § 1024.38(a)(2) to reduce significant litigation exposure, they urged the Bureau to do the same with respect to proposed § 1024.40(b)(2). Moreover, as is true in the general servicing policies and procedures context, the Bureau is concerned that the safe harbor in proposed § 1024.40(b)(2) would hamper the Bureau and other regulators in exercising supervisory authority and could preclude relief from being secured until there have been widespread or repeated incidents of consumer harm. Further, the safe harbor is no longer necessary because, as discussed above, the Bureau has decided to finalize § 1024.40 such that there will be no private liability for violations of the provision. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting § 1024.40(b)(2) and related comments 40(b)(2)-1.i and ii. Instead, the Bureau is only adopting § 1024.40(b)(1) as § 1024.40(b).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.40(b)(1) is largely adopted as § 1024.40(b)(1) through (3). In addition to changes that have been noted above, the Bureau has made technical changes to proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(B) (redesignated as § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)) to be consistent with changes to the language of § 1024.41, to clarify that the function of accessing the information set forth in proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii) (redesignated as § 1024.40(b)(2)) means retrieval, and to clarify that the retrieval must be done in a timely manner. The Bureau is also clarifying that “document” means “written information” for purposes of proposed § 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(B) (redesignated as § 1024.40(b)(2)(ii)).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1024.40 Continuity of Contact</title>
            <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Background.</em> As discussed above, this final rule addresses servicers' obligation to provide delinquent borrowers with access to servicer personnel to respond to inquiries, and as applicable, assist them with foreclosure avoidance options. Widespread reports of communication breakdowns between servicers and delinquent borrowers who present a heightened risk for default have revealed that one of the most significant impediments to the success of foreclosure mitigation programs is the inadequate manner by which servicer personnel at major servicers have provided assistance to these borrowers. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the problem was systemic. For example, Federal regulatory agencies reviewing mortgage servicing practices have found that “a majority of the [servicers examined] had inadequate staffing levels or had recently added staff with limited servicing experience.”<footnote ref="157">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Fed. Reserve Sys., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, &amp;amp; Office of Thrift Supervision, Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices, at 8 (2011).</footnote>
            The Bureau proposed § 1024.40 to establish requirements to ensure that there would be a baseline level of standards that would address the issue.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) would have provided that a servicer must assign personnel to respond to borrower inquiries and as applicable, assist a borrower with loss mitigation options no later than five days after a servicer has provided such borrower with the oral notice that would have been required by proposed § 1024.39(a). For a transferee servicer, proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) would have required such servicer to make the assignment within a reasonable time after the mortgage servicing right to a borrower's mortgage loan has been transferred to such servicer if the borrower's previous servicer had assigned personnel to such borrower as would have been required by proposed § 1024.40(a)(1) before the mortgage servicing right was transferred and the assignment had not ended when the servicing right was transferred. Proposed § 1024.40(a)(2) would have required a servicer to make access to assigned personnel available via telephone and would have set forth related requirements on what a servicer must do if a borrower contacts the servicer and does not receive a live response from the assigned personnel. Proposed § 1024.40(b) would have required a servicer to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the servicer personnel the servicer assigns to a borrower pursuant to proposed § 1024.40(a) perform certain enumerated functions. Proposed § 1024.40(c) would have set forth requirements with respect to how long the assigned personnel must be assigned and available to a borrower.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Although many servicers failed to adequately assist delinquent borrowers, the Bureau recognized that some servicers provide a high level of customer service to their borrowers both to ensure loan performance (because either they or one of their affiliates owned the loan) and maintain strong customer relationships (because they rely on providing borrowers with other products and services and thus have a strong interest in preserving their reputation and relationships with their customers). The Bureau believed that to the extent that a servicer's existing practices with respect to providing assistance to delinquent borrowers have been successful at helping borrowers avoid foreclosure, it was important that these practices be permitted to continue to exist within the framework of proposed § 1024.40. The Bureau sought to clarify the Bureau's intent by explaining in proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i that the continuity of contact provisions allowed a servicer to exercise discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received general comments about whether it was appropriate for the Bureau to regulate the manner by which servicer personnel at servicers provide assistance to delinquent borrowers. With one exception, consumer groups expressed support for proposed § 1024.40. One consumer group that identified itself as primarily serving Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander communities expressed concern that proposed § 1024.40 only appeared to address the initial assignment of servicer staff to assist delinquent borrowers. The commenter also urged the Bureau to mirror the more prescriptive approach of the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A number of consumer groups suggested that the Bureau add an additional requirement to require servicers to establish electronic loan portals to facilitate the exchange of documents related to a borrower's loan modification application. Consumer groups asserted that servicers' insistence that borrowers have not submitted requested documents remains a barrier to loan modification success and that the National Mortgage Settlement already requires the five largest servicers to develop online portals linked to a servicer's primary servicing system where borrowers can check the status of their first-lien loan modifications, at no cost to them.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally expressed agreement with the principle that servicers must have adequate staffing levels to meet the needs of delinquent borrowers and commended the Bureau for recognizing the importance of permitting successful servicing practices with respect to how servicers provide assistance to delinquent borrowers to continue to exist. But smaller servicers and rural creditors subject to Farm Credit Administration rules generally requested exemptions from the continuity of contact requirements.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Smaller servicers predicted that the continuity of contact requirements will bring about a significant increase in borrower communication, which they will have to respond by significantly increasing the size of their staff and making substantial changes to their servicing platforms. Smaller servicers asserted that these adjustments will increase their compliance costs and result in the reduction in the high quality of customer service they already provide to their customers. Rural lenders subject to Farm Credit Administration rules asserted that they should be exempted from the Bureau's continuity of contact requirements because they are already required to follow a highly prescriptive set of regulations when working with borrowers with distressed loans issued by the Farm Credit Administration. They expressed concern about potentially having to comply with inconsistent regulations and borrower confusion.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A national trade association representing the reverse mortgage industry sought a general exemption for reverse mortgages, asserting that continuity of contact requirements would be duplicative of existing HUD regulations that require servicers of home equity conversion mortgages (HECM) to assign specific employees to assist HECM borrowers and provide the information to HECM borrowers on an annual basis and whenever the assigned employees change.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to make changes to § 1024.40 where they contend the proposal is inconsistent with the National Mortgage Settlement because of the cost of potentially being required to comply with different standards. One non-bank servicer requested that the Bureau specify that compliance with § 1024.40 would provide a safe harbor from compliance with similar applicable law, including State law, the National Mortgage Settlement, HAMP guidelines, and investor requirements. Another non-bank servicer asserted that several of the functions the Bureau proposed to require continuity of contact personnel to perform under § 1024.40 would require servicers under some States' law to make available licensed loan originators to assist borrowers and that the Bureau should preempt such laws because servicers may not have an adequate number of licensed staff.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One bank servicer and one non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau could reduce any potential compliance burden with § 1024.40 if the Bureau limited a servicer's duty to comply with § 1024.40 to borrowers who are responsive to servicers' attempts to engage them in foreclosure avoidance options and who have not vacated their principal residences. One non-bank servicer urged the Bureau create an exemption from compliance with continuity of contact requirements with respect to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau has made a number of changes to § 1024.40. The Bureau has concluded that the best way to ensure that existing, successful servicing practices with respect to assisting delinquent borrowers be able to continue to exist would be to adopt proposed § 1024.40 as a requirement for servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieved specified objectives, and leave it to each servicers to implement its own policies and procedures calculated to achieve the desired results. Given the flexibility provided by § 1024.40 as finalized, the Bureau does not discern a need to provide servicers with express safe harbors or preemptions or a need to make § 1024.40 align exactly with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also declines to adopt the electronic portal requirement a number of consumers have urged the Bureau to impose on servicers. The Bureau agrees that servicers should, consistent with the purposes of RESPA, facilitate the exchange of documents related to a borrower's loan modification application and is adopting requirements in the final rule that would support this objective. For example, § 1024.38(b)(2)(iii) requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of providing prompt access to all documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation option to servicer personnel assigned to assist the borrower as described in § 1024.40. The Bureau believes that to fulfill this requirement, servicers must have policies and procedures for the use of reasonable means to track and maintain borrower-submitted loss mitigation documents. However, imposing on servicers a specific obligation to establish electronic portals would supplant other reasonable means to track and maintain borrower-submitted loss mitigation documents. As noted above, the Bureau expects to further consider the benefits of electronic portals, as well as requirements regarding electronic communication with servicers more broadly.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Further, for reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.30, the Bureau has decided that requirements set forth in the Bureau's discretionary rulemakings are generally not appropriate to impose on small servicers (servicers that servicers 5,000 mortgage loans or less and only servicers mortgage loans that either they or their affiliates own or originated), housing finance agencies, servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000, and servicers of reverse mortgage transactions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, for reasons set forth above, the Bureau has limited the scope of §§ 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence. But the Bureau declines to further limit the scope of § 1024.40 to “responsive borrowers” or to exclude borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. As discussed above, the purpose of the early intervention, continuity of contact, and loss mitigation procedure requirements is to ensure that a borrower who resides in a property as a principal residence have the protection of clear standards of review for loss mitigation options so that the borrower can be considered for an option that will assist the borrower in retaining the property and the owner or assignee in mitigating losses. The Bureau believes limiting the applicability of § 1024.40 to “responsive” borrowers introduces a notable degree of subjectivity that conflicts with this purpose. The Bureau additionally declines to create an exemption with respect to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy because the exemption would be too broad. A borrower could have filed for bankruptcy but still be eligible for loss mitigation assistance.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Legal Authority</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.40 pursuant to authority under sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a) of RESPA, and accordingly, like other rules issued pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 6 of RESPA, § 1024.40 would have been enforceable through private rights of action. But as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.40 as an objectives-based policies and procedures requirement. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.38, the Bureau believes that private liability is not compatible with objectives-based policies and procedures requirements. The Bureau has therefore decided to finalize § 1024.40 such that there will be no private liability for violations of the provision. Accordingly, the Bureau no longer relies on its authorities under section 6 of RESPA to issue § 1024.40. Instead, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.40 pursuant to its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA. The Bureau believes that the objectives-based policies and procedures set forth in § 1024.40 that regulate the manner by which servicer personnel provide assistance to delinquent borrowers are necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including avoiding unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, ensuring that servicers are responsive to consumer requests and complaints, and facilitating the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting § 1024.40 pursuant to its authority under section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial laws. Specifically, the Bureau believes that § 1024.40 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objective under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>41(a) Enforcement and Limitations</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(a) would have required any servicer that offers loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41. The purpose of this section was to clarify that the requirements in proposed § 1024.41 are applicable only to those servicers that are engaged in a practice, in the ordinary course of business, of evaluating loss mitigation options for their own portfolios or pursuant to duties owed to investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Further, proposed comment 41(a)-1 clarified that nothing in proposed § 1024.41 was intended to impose a duty on a servicer to offer loss mitigation options to borrowers generally or to offer or approve any particular borrower for a loss mitigation option. As set forth in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau did not intend to create a private right of action for borrowers to enforce, in private litigation, any requirements that are imposed by owners or assignees of mortgage loans (including investors or guarantors) on servicers to mitigate losses for such parties. Rather, the Bureau intended that borrowers could enforce the loss mitigation procedures against servicers to ensure that servicers complied with the appropriate procedural steps before completing the foreclosure process when a borrower had submitted a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>If a servicer did not evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business, the servicer would not have been subject to proposed § 1024.41. In proposed comment 41(a)-2, the Bureau set forth examples of practices that, by themselves, would not have been considered indicia that a servicer had opted to offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau notes, however, that the proposed definition of loss mitigation options in § 1024.31, however, was expansive, encompassing not just loan modifications, but also forbearance plans, short sale agreements, and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure programs. The Bureau believes that substantially all, if not all, servicers offer these loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocate commenters stated that the loss mitigation procedures should not be limited to mortgage servicers that offered loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. These commenters stated that the recent financial crisis has demonstrated that reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options has risen to the level of a standard servicer duty that should be expected of all mortgage servicers. Further, industry commenters did not take issue with the concept that engaging in loss mitigation should be considered a standard servicer duty. Rather, comments from industry focused instead on whether prescriptive loss mitigation requirements would adversely affect the manner in which servicers engage in reviews of borrowers for loss mitigation options. Specifically, a number of large banks and their trade associations stated that a private right of action for loss mitigation was a particular concern. These commenters indicated that borrowers should not be entitled to bring an action to enforce loss mitigation requirements set forth by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or a voluntary loss mitigation program (such as HAMP). In addition, the Bureau's outreach and additional analysis raised questions regarding whether the scope of the loss mitigation provisions should be limited to a borrower's principal residence consistent with other governmental initiatives.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Community banks, credit unions, and their trade associations commented that the loss mitigation procedures (and other rulemakings not specifically required by the Dodd-Frank Act) should exempt small servicers. These commenters also argued that the definition of small servicers should be large enough to cover most credit unions and community banks. A trade association for reverse mortgage lenders commented that reverse mortgage servicers should be exempt from the proposed rules. Further, four farm credit system institutions stated that they should be exempt because they are required to comply with distressed borrower regulations promulgated by the Farm Credit Administration in 12 CFR part 617. A nonprofit lender commented that bona-fide nonprofits should be exempt from the mortgage servicing rules.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has adjusted § 1024.41(a) in response to the public comments. First, the Bureau has revised § 1024.41(a) to eliminate the limitation on the loss mitigation procedures to only those servicers that offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau has not identified from the comments or outreach any servicers that did not offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by the Bureau and would not have been subject to § 1024.41 as proposed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that owners or assignees of mortgage loans should determine whether they will offer loss mitigation options and, if so, the Bureau does not believe an exemption from complying with the loss mitigation procedures should exist based on separate business practices of a servicer. Further, the Bureau believes that it is preferable that temporary or pilot programs should be addressed through clarifications regarding for which programs, if any, a servicer should evaluate a borrower's application, not by limiting the overall application of the loss mitigation procedures. Accordingly, § 1024.41(a) has been adjusted to require that servicers comply with the requirements of § 1024.41 without consideration of whether a servicer currently offers loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, for the reasons set forth above with respect to § 1024.30, the scope of § 1024.41 has been changed to limit the scope of the loss mitigation procedures to a borrower's principal residence. Third, for the reasons set forth above with respect to § 1024.30, the Bureau has exempted from the loss mitigation procedures requirements (1) small servicers (with the exception of § 1024.41(j)), (2) reverse mortgage transactions, and (3) “qualified lenders” that are required to comply with Farm Credit Administration regulations relating to distressed borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau observes that the loss mitigation procedures are issued, among other authorities, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 6 of RESPA. Violations of section 6 of RESPA are subject to a private right of action pursuant to section 6(f) of RESPA. Servicers may be liable to borrowers pursuant to section 6(f) of RESPA for failure to comply with the loss mitigation procedures in § 1024.41. The Bureau believes a private right of action for borrowers to enforce the loss mitigation procedures is necessary to ensure that individual borrowers have the necessary tools to ensure they receive the benefit of the loss mitigation procedures in their own individual circumstances. Further, the Bureau believes that the risk of a private right of action will not negatively impact access to, or cost of, credit. The requirements in § 1024.41 include clear procedural requirements and have been calibrated to avoid risks of litigation relating to owner or assignee contractual requirements, as discussed below. Further, the requirements in § 1024.41 are consistent with requirements already implemented by the GSEs, the National Mortgage Settlement, and certain State laws, with respect to certain servicers. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised § 1024.41(a) to reflect the effect of section 6(f) of RESPA with respect to a private right of action.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although servicers are required to comply with the procedural requirements of § 1024.41, the Bureau has clarified in response to inquiries raised by commenters that servicers are not required by the Bureau's rules to offer any particular loss mitigation option to any particular borrower. Nothing in § 1024.41 should affect whether a borrower is permitted as a matter of contract law to enforce the terms of any contract or agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Accordingly, the Bureau finalizes § 1024.41(a) by relocating the substance of proposed comment 41(a)-1 in the text of § 1024.41(a). Section 1024.41(a) provides that nothing in § 1024.41 imposes a duty on a servicer to offer any borrower any particular loss mitigation option. Further, § 1024.41(a) states nothing in § 1024.41 should be construed to permit a borrower to enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or provision of, any loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>41(b) Loss Mitigation Application</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(b) defined the term complete loss mitigation application and set forth requirements for servicers with regard to both complete and incomplete loss mitigation applications. Specifically, proposed § 1024.41(b)(1) stated that a complete loss mitigation application means a borrower's submission requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option for which a servicer has received all the information the servicer regularly obtains and considers in evaluating a loss mitigation application by the deadline established by the servicer. Proposed § 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives an incomplete loss mitigation application to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining information from a borrower to make the application complete. Further, proposed § 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives an incomplete loss mitigation application earlier than 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) before the deadline established by the servicer to notify the borrower that the application was incomplete, the documents and information necessary to make the application complete, and the date by which the borrower must submit such documents. The servicer would have been required to provide the notice within 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after receiving an incomplete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received numerous comments regarding these requirements. First, the Bureau received comments regarding the definition of a loss mitigation application and a complete loss mitigation application. A large bank servicer requested clarification regarding prequalification processes, including whether oral communications with borrowers should be considered a loss mitigation application. A non-bank servicer commented that defining a complete loss mitigation application as requiring all the information the servicer “regularly obtains” is both ambiguous and unduly limiting with respect to evaluations of borrowers in substantially different circumstances or subject to substantially different investor requirements. The commenter suggested instead that the Bureau define a complete loss mitigation application as a borrower's submission requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option for which a servicer has received all the information the servicer obtains and considers in evaluating a loss mitigation application for a particular loan type, investor, or other group of loans, as deemed appropriate by the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau received comments regarding servicer obligations upon receipt of a loss mitigation application. Specifically, four consumer advocacy groups stated that servicers should be required to review a loss mitigation application for completeness promptly upon receipt. Conversely, a trade association commented that five days is too short a time to evaluate a loss mitigation application, determine that it is incomplete, determine what additional documentation is needed, and generate a notice to the borrower. A financial industry trade association requested that the Bureau provide guidance in the form of examples of “reasonable diligence” to obtain information from borrowers. The commenter suggested that one example be that the servicer sends a letter or electronic communication to the borrower with a list of what information is needed and how the borrower can submit that information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Third, a non-bank servicer commented that the Bureau should create standard loss mitigation applications so that industry may align around similar loss mitigation strategies. Finally, a coalition of 60 consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should mandate that servicers provide borrowers that submit incomplete loss mitigation applications a reasonable amount of time to complete the applications.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has adjusted § 1024.41(b) in response to the public comments. First, the Bureau agrees with commenters that further clarification regarding the definitions of the term loss mitigation application and complete loss mitigation application is appropriate. Section 1024.31 defines a loss mitigation application to mean an oral or written request for a loss mitigation option that is accompanied by any information required by a servicer for evaluation for a loss mitigation option. This definition is intended to distinguish between inquiries regarding the availability of loss mitigation options and an actual request for an evaluation for a loss mitigation option. The Bureau intends the loss mitigation procedures to apply when servicers receive loss mitigation applications during oral communications with borrowers, including communications between the borrower and any contact personnel assigned to the borrower's mortgage loan account pursuant to § 1024.40.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The definition of a complete loss mitigation application (and, consequently, an incomplete loss mitigation application) has been designed similarly to the complete and incomplete application concepts underlying Regulation B. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1002.2(f), 1002.9(c). Thus, at a point in a conversation between a borrower and a mortgage servicer, if the borrower requests an evaluation for a loss mitigation option and provides information to the servicer that will be used in the evaluation of a loss mitigation application, the borrower has made a loss mitigation application, and the servicer, pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A), must review the application promptly to determine whether it is complete or incomplete.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>If a loss mitigation application is complete and has been submitted by an applicable deadline, the servicer must evaluate the loss mitigation application pursuant to the requirements in § 1024.41. Under § 1024.41(b)(1), a complete loss mitigation application means an application in connection with which a servicer has received all the information that the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower. The Bureau has removed the requirement that a loss mitigation application must include all the information the servicer regularly obtains and considers in evaluating loss mitigation applications. This change is intended to further the goal of providing servicers flexibility to determine the information required for any individual mortgage loan borrower's application for a loss mitigation option and require servicers to consider an application complete notwithstanding that the borrower has not submitted certain information that the servicer may regularly require but is irrelevant with respect to a particular borrower. Thus, under § 1024.41(b)(1), a loss mitigation application is complete when a servicer receives all information that a servicer requires from a borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.41(b)(1) requires a servicer to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining information to complete a loss mitigation application and to evaluate a complete loss mitigation application. Accordingly, a servicer is required to exercise reasonable diligence to follow up with borrowers to obtain any information the borrower has not submitted that is necessary to make the application complete and to ensure that the servicer timely receives any necessary third-party information, such as an automated valuation or consumer report. Contrary to requests from commenters, the Bureau declines to implement commentary that providing the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2) constitutes reasonable diligence for purposes of § 1024.41(b)(1). Rather, reasonable diligence is based on the circumstances, including the circumstances of any continuing discussions between a borrower and the contact personnel assigned pursuant to § 1024.40. Such contact personnel should have information regarding the status of a borrower's loss mitigation application and should work with borrowers to make any such loss mitigation application complete. The Bureau has added commentary to clarify this requirement as set forth below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added commentary to § 1024.41(b) to clarify the meaning of a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-1 to clarify that a servicer, consistent with the requirements of the investor or assignee with respect to a particular mortgage, has flexibility to establish application requirements for a loss mitigation option offered by an owner or assignee and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from borrowers applying for loss mitigation options. The Bureau agrees with the comments that servicers may require different application information for loss mitigation programs undertaken for different owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Different owners or assignees may establish widely varying criteria and requirements for loss mitigation evaluations, and servicers may require different forms and types of information to effectuate such programs. The Bureau believes the requirement that a complete loss mitigation application contain information required by servicers provides appropriate flexibility to servicers to determine application requirements consistent with the variety of borrower circumstances or owner or assignee requirements that servicers must evaluate and to ensure that individual borrowers are not obliged to provide information or documents that are unnecessary and inappropriate for a loss mitigation evaluation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added comments 41(b)(1)-2 and 41(b)(1)-3 in response to comments requesting clarity regarding prequalification programs and other feedback seeking clarification regarding informal communications between servicers and borrowers. As set forth above, the Bureau received a comment from a large bank servicer requesting clarification regarding prequalification programs. Further, in outreach, another large bank servicer requested clarification regarding whether the Bureau's regulations, and specifically, the error resolution and the loss mitigation procedures represented a policy of regulation of informal communication.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau has withdrawn the proposed requirements regarding oral error resolution and information request process with respect to §§ 1024.35-1024.36, the Bureau believes that the loss mitigation procedures should apply when a borrower orally requests evaluation for a loss mitigation option. One of the principal goals of the early intervention and continuity of contact requirements of the rule is to establish oral communications between servicers and borrowers; it would be inconsistent with that purpose to ignore these communications in determining whether a borrower has requested consideration for a loss mitigation option. Further, one of the purposes of the loss mitigation procedures is to provide accurate information to borrowers and to facilitate the evaluation of foreclosure avoidance options by creating uniform evaluation processes and ensuring that a borrower obtains an evaluation for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower. That purpose may be circumvented if the loss mitigation requirements focused only on written communications, and a servicer could steer a borrower into a specific loss mitigation option through oral communications. Consistent with the requirements set forth in Regulation B regarding applications for credit, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to implement requirements on servicers to treat oral communications that have sufficiently passed the point of inquiries as loss mitigation applications subject to the loss mitigation procedures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-2 to clarify when an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application. The Bureau recognizes there is substantial ambiguity in interpersonal communications but believes that loss mitigation applications should be considered expansively. For example, if a borrower indicates that the borrower would like to apply for a loss mitigation option and provides any information the servicer would evaluate in connection with a loss mitigation application, a borrower has submitted a loss mitigation application. Because a servicer must exercise reasonable diligence in making a loss mitigation application complete, the Bureau believes appropriate communication with a borrower that expresses an interest in a loss mitigation option is to clarify the borrower's intention regarding the submission and to obtain information from the borrower to make a loss mitigation application complete.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Not all communications regarding loss mitigation options will constitute loss mitigation applications. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-3 to illustrate circumstances where oral communications will not constitute a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(b)(1)-3.i states that a borrower calls to ask about loss mitigation options and servicer personnel explain the loss mitigation options available to the borrower and the criteria for determining the borrower's eligibility for any such loss mitigation option. In this example, only an inquiry has taken place. The borrower has not submitted information that would be evaluated in connection with a loss mitigation option. Comment 41(b)(1)-3.ii states that a borrower calls to ask about the process for applying for a loss mitigation option but the borrower does not provide any information that a servicer would consider for evaluating a loss mitigation application. A servicer that provides information regarding the process for applying for a loss mitigation application has not taken a loss mitigation application in this circumstance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-4 to indicate how a servicer should comply with its requirement to undertake reasonable diligence to obtain the information necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. For example, a servicer must request information necessary to make a loss mitigation application complete promptly after receiving the loss mitigation application. Comment 41(b)(1)-4.i provides that reasonable diligence requires contacting an applicant promptly to obtain information missing from a loss mitigation application, like an address or telephone number to verify employment. This obligation exists notwithstanding a servicer's obligation to provide a notice pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B). Further, comment 41(b)(1)-4.ii provides that reasonable diligence also includes reviewing documents that may have been included in connection with a servicing transfer to determine if a borrower previously submitted information or documents to a transferor servicer that may complete a loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-5 regarding circumstances where a servicer requires information that is not in the borrower's control. A loss mitigation application is complete when a borrower provides all information required from the borrower notwithstanding that additional information may be required by a servicer that is not in the control of a borrower. For example, if a servicer requires a consumer report for a loss mitigation evaluation, a loss mitigation application is considered complete if a borrower has submitted all information required from the borrower without regard to whether a servicer has obtained a consumer report that a servicer has requested from a consumer reporting agency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also adjusted the requirements in § 1024.41(b)(2) with respect to a servicer's obligation upon receipt of a loss mitigation application. The Bureau agrees with the comments it received that a servicer should be required to promptly evaluate a loss mitigation application to determine whether the application is complete or incomplete. Accordingly, § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A) requires a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application to determine promptly upon receipt whether such application is complete or incomplete. Further, under § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), a servicer must notify a borrower in 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) regarding whether the servicer has determined an application is complete or incomplete.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application to provide a notice to a borrower only in the event a loss mitigation application is incomplete. The Bureau recognizes, however, that a borrower that submits a complete loss mitigation application may not realize that such application has been considered complete and that an evaluation for a loss mitigation application is ongoing. Accordingly, § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) requires providing a notice to a borrower regardless of whether the application is complete or incomplete.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) further requires a servicer that determines a loss mitigation application is incomplete to notify the borrower of the additional documents and information the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete and the date by which the borrower must submit the additional documents and information to be reviewed. The notice to the borrower must also include a statement that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options. The Bureau has added this statement to the notice in connection with withdrawing proposed § 1024.41(j), discussed below, with respect to providing a loss mitigation application to servicers of other mortgage loan liens. Further, because of the added content of the notice and the requirements with respect to oral communications constituting loss mitigation applications, the Bureau has determined to withdraw the proposal that the notice required pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) could be provided orally. Rather, the Bureau has determined the notice must be provided in writing.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau finds that 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable amount of time for a servicer to comply with the requirements for an incomplete loss mitigation application. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, as well as the National Mortgage Settlement, require servicers to provide a substantially similar but, in some cases, more prescriptive, notice within 5 business days of receipt of an incomplete loss mitigation application.<footnote ref="176">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See United States of America&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; at Appendix A, at A-26, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com&lt;/em&gt; ; Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide, Vol. 2 &amp;#167; 64.6(d)(4) (2012); Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide &amp;#167; 205.07 (2012).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) to clarify how a servicer communicates to a borrower the deadline by which the borrower should submit a complete loss mitigation application. A servicer must state to the borrower that the borrower should submit documents needed to complete the application by the earliest remaining date of four potential options. The rule provides that a servicer must disclose the date a borrower should complete a loss mitigation application, rather than the date a borrower must complete a loss mitigation application, because the effect of the various timelines is that a borrower may miss the deadline communicated by the servicer but still be able to submit a complete loss mitigation application in the future (and thus a requirement that a borrower must complete an application by an earlier deadline may be inaccurate). However, a borrower should complete the application by the applicable deadline in order to incur the lowest application burden and to gain the benefit of the most consumer protections for the loss mitigation application. Further, the Bureau agrees with comments received from a number of servicers and their trade associations that it is appropriate to encourage earlier submission of loss mitigation applications by borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A servicer must state that the borrower should provide the documents and information by the earliest remaining date of: (a) The date by which any document or information already submitted by a borrower will be considered stale or invalid pursuant to any requirements applicable to any loss mitigation program available to the borrower; (b) the date that is the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency; (c) the date that is 90 days before a foreclosure sale; or (d) the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale. Dates in (b), (c), and (d) are designed to match the various scenarios set forth above with respect to the timing of the loss mitigation procedures. The date in (a) is meant to incorporate any internal servicer policy to ensure that borrowers do not submit documents beyond the date when documents and information previously provided are considered stale or invalid, which would frustrate the process of obtaining a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
          <analysisSection target="1024-41-c" notice="2013-01248" date="2013-02-14">
              <title>41(c) Evaluation of Loss Mitigation Applications</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(c) would have required that, within 30 days of receiving a complete loss mitigation application, a servicer must evaluate the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower and provide the borrower with a written notice stating the servicer's determination of whether it will offer the borrower a loss mitigation option. In the proposal, the Bureau stated that it was appropriate to require servicers to evaluate complete loss mitigation applications within 30 days because review of a loss mitigation application in 30 days is an industry standard, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further stated that it is appropriate to require a servicer to evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower rather than requiring borrowers to select options for which the borrower may be evaluated. A servicer is in a better position than a borrower to determine the loss mitigation programs for which a borrower may qualify. Requiring that a borrower select a loss mitigation option for which the borrower may be considered, or only evaluating a borrower for a few loss mitigation options, may cause a borrower to accept or reject an option without seeking evaluation for another option. This may lead to less effective programs, disparate outcomes for similarly situated borrowers, and longer timelines for effectuating loss mitigation options. Instead, the Bureau has proposed that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation programs available to the borrower. The Bureau believes that this approach will ensure that all borrowers receive fair evaluations for all options available to them and will be able to select options appropriate for their circumstances. In sum, owners or assignees of mortgage loans (including investors, guarantors, and insurers that establish criteria governing loss mitigation programs) retain the ability to manage loss mitigation programs to ensure that borrower eligibility and program administration is consistent with their requirements, while borrowers will be able to understand all potential options that may be available.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocate commenters supported the proposed requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower within 30 days. For example, one such commenter stated that the rule as proposed would add more transparency in the loss mitigation process, would enable borrowers to make a more informed decision on their loss mitigation options, and would actually reduce paperwork burdens on borrowers by eliminating the necessity of a borrower having to send duplicate and additional paperwork each time a borrower requested consideration for a different loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Conversely, industry commenters, including numerous large banks, credit unions, community banks, non-bank servicers, and their trade associations, generally opposed the requirement that a servicer review a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower within 30 days. These commenters generally believed that servicers should be permitted to follow investor waterfalls for foreclosure prevention options. These commenters stated that the volume of documents borrowers may be required to submit to effectuate a review of all loss mitigation options may be substantial. Further, industry commenters stated that the rule as proposed would require overly complicated and unclear communications with customers and those customers should be entitled to a communication only about the option for which they specifically applied.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters requested that the Bureau permit servicers to allow borrowers to choose between home retention and non-home retention options for evaluations. For example, a Federal agency stated that servicers should be able to separate borrowers for evaluation purposes based upon whether a hardship is temporary or permanent and, accordingly, whether a home retention or non-home retention option is appropriate. A law firm commented that servicers should be able to apply different evaluations for borrowers that indicate a preference for a home retention or non-home retention option. A small credit union and three community bank commenters stated that loss mitigation should be a flexible process and prescriptive requirements that servicers review for all options may reduce optionality in favor of a “one size fits all” process. Further, a credit union trade association stated that requiring credit unions to review for all loss mitigation options would be overly burdensome. One trade association requested that the requirement that a servicer be required to review for all loss mitigation options should be withdrawn because it is not required by the Dodd-Frank Act and because providing a notice of all options will result in appeals from borrowers seeking more attractive workout options.<footnote ref="177">Notably, a large bank servicer stated that the 30 day requirement should be waived if a servicer does not have delegated authority to approve loss mitigation options. The commenter's suggestion is contrary to the purposes of the loss mitigation procedures and the general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements (which require a servicer to establish policies and procedures for identifying with specificity the loss mitigation options that are available to borrowers and evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan).</footnote>
            Finally, a large bank servicer and a Federal agency requested clarification that a servicer is not required to provide borrowers with information about modifications that are not available to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is adopting § 1024.41(c) as proposed with minor modifications. Further, the Bureau is adopting the commentary to § 1024.41(c) with minor modifications. The requirements of proposed § 1024.41(c) are located within § 1024.41(c)(1). The Bureau has also added § 1024.41(c)(2) to implement requirements for offering loss mitigation options to borrowers that have not completed loss mitigation applications, which are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that owners and assignees of mortgage loans should have latitude to establish appropriate loss mitigation programs and the eligibility criteria for such programs. For example, if a servicer services mortgage loans for itself and for the GSEs, a servicer is only required to review a borrower whose mortgage loan is guaranteed by the GSEs for programs approved by the GSEs, pursuant to criteria established by the GSEs. The servicer is not required to review the GSE borrower for loss mitigation options the servicer implements for mortgage loans owned by the servicer or another investor, because such loss mitigation options are not available to the borrower and any such evaluation is unnecessary and futile. Further, the applicable owner or assignee has latitude to set forth any evaluation criteria the owner or assignee deems appropriate. If a loss mitigation option is only available for military servicemembers, a servicer has conducted a proper evaluation if it determines that the borrower is not a servicemember and, therefore, does not meet the eligibility criteria for the program. Similarly, to the extent eligibility criteria for pilot programs, temporary programs, or programs that are limited by the number of participating borrowers, would exclude a borrower from eligibility, a servicer is not obligated to evaluate the borrower for any such loss mitigation option as if such eligibility criteria did not exist. The owner or assignee of a mortgage loan has the freedom to establish or authorize any programs it deems appropriate and to establish or authorize the eligibility criteria for such programs that the owner or assignee deems appropriate; a servicer is only obligated to provide the borrower a notice stating the results of the servicer's review of the borrower's complete loss mitigation application for the programs established or authorized by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. To this end, the Bureau has clarified in § 1024.41(c)(1) that a servicer is required to evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Use of a “waterfall” as an eligibility criterion.</em> The Bureau believes the requirements in § 1024.41(c)(1) to evaluate a loss mitigation application for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower is not inconsistent with a determination by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options by using a “waterfall” method. A waterfall is simply an evaluation rule. For example, an owner or assignee may provide six loss mitigation programs for which borrowers should be evaluated. The owner or assignee may further provide that the programs should be evaluated in order from one through six and that if a borrower is offered a program evaluated higher in the order, the borrower will be denied for all other programs lower in the order. Thus, in this example, if a borrower were offered program two, the borrower would necessarily be denied for programs three through six as a consequence of the owner's or assignee's requirements. Nothing in the loss mitigation procedures dictates a result different than that obtained using a waterfall.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Evaluation for all loss mitigation options.</em> The requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, in combination with the notice requirements of § 1024.41(d)(1), is intended to enable a borrower (1) to understand the loss mitigation options for which the servicer has determined the borrower is eligible, (2) to understand the results of the servicer's evaluation of the borrower for any loan modification option, and (3) for any loan modification option, to obtain the reasons for the borrower's denial for a loan modification option. The impact of the requirement that a borrower receive an evaluation for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower is that the borrower may, by submitting a single application, receive a complete review and either obtain a loss mitigation option that a borrower may or may not have known was available or, pursuant to § 1024.41(d)(1), understand the reasons why the borrower is not eligible for a loan modification option. The Bureau does not believe that the requirements in § 1024.41(c)(1) will impair an investor's or guarantor's ability to implement or manage loss mitigation programs.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that the requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower will impose onerous application burdens on a borrower, require a servicer to provide confusing or unhelpful communications to borrowers, or frustrate borrowers that, in theory, may only wish to obtain an evaluation for a specific type of loss mitigation option. Loss mitigation options generally fall into two categories, those involving home retention (most notably loan modifications) and non-home retention options. Insofar as commenters are suggesting that different retention options carry with them different application requirements and that servicers should be free to consider borrowers sequentially for different options through separate application processes, the Bureau disagrees. With respect to home retention options, outreach with consumer advocates and industry participants has not indicated that there are significant differences in the information required for consideration for differing retention options offered by a single investor or assignee such that requiring consideration for all of these options at once will add burden to the consumer or servicer. Importantly, the National Mortgage Settlement states that “[u]pon timely receipt of a complete loan modification application, Servicer shall evaluate borrowers for all available loan modification options for which they are eligible * * * .”<footnote ref="178">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See United States of America&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; at Appendix A, at A-16, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Although it is true, as a large bank commenter stated, that the Bureau's requirements apply to all loss mitigation options and not just loan modification options, the Bureau does not believe that this additional requirement will add significant burden to consumers or servicers. The Bureau understands from outreach with servicers that most investors or guarantors do not permit a borrower to be evaluated for a non-home retention option (i.e., to walk away from a mortgage) unless a home retention option is not viable. Thus, in all events borrowers will be required to submit the financial and other information required for consideration of retention options and servicers will be required to obtain additional information about the borrower (such as a consumer report) and the property (such as an automated valuation). The Bureau is not persuaded that significant additional burdens are required to be able to consider a borrower for non-home retention options if the borrower is found not to be eligible for home retention options.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that industry commenters and trade associations are concerned that evaluation for non-home retention options may cause servicers to incur additional work and cost, including by obtaining a title search or an appraisal. The Bureau has added comment 41(c)(1)-3 to clarify that an offer of a non-home retention option may be conditional upon receipt of further information not in the borrower's possession and necessary to establish the parameters of a servicer's offer. For example, a servicer complies with the requirement for evaluating the borrower for a short sale option if the servicer offers the borrower the opportunity to enter into a listing or marketing period agreement but indicates that specifics of an acceptable short sale transaction may be subject to further information obtained from an appraisal or title search.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that significant consumer benefits will result from requiring that consumers be considered for all loss mitigation options in a single process. The Bureau understands that borrowers may incur more significant burdens in the current market as evaluations occur sequentially over time and borrower documents and information must be continuously updated to make such documents and information current. The requirements of § 1024.41(c)(1) will eliminate the need for borrowers to submit multiple applications for different loss mitigation options and will provide for more efficient compliance by servicers with the requirements of the rule. In addition, as set forth below with respect to § 1024.41(d), the Bureau believes providing information to borrowers on the result of their review for available loss mitigation options will assist consumers and is unlikely to create confusion.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau believes that a process that imposes the obligation on the borrower to identify the appropriate loss mitigation option is inappropriate. The selection of a loss mitigation option is complex and requires an understanding of the potential eligibility of a borrower when compared against the complex rule systems applied to evaluate such options. The differences among loss mitigation programs befuddle industry experts, much less borrowers attempting to evaluate such options while under the fear of foreclosure. The Bureau simply does not believe that permitting servicers to steer borrowers to apply for particular loss mitigation options, when the servicer has a far superior capacity to make the relevant determination, reasonably protects the borrower's interest. Rather, the Bureau believes a more reasonable default is for the party with the knowledge of all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, and the capability of evaluating the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, to carry the burden of evaluating the borrower for all loss mitigation options available from the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and to communicate the results of that review to the borrower. If the borrower is found to be eligible for more than one option, the borrower can then make a more informed choice of the options available <em data-original="E-03">after</em> the evaluation has occurred, not before; if the borrower is found to be eligible for only one option (as would likely be the case where the owner or assignee follows a waterfall) the borrower will at least receive information indicating why the borrower is being offered a particular option and not others and will, in certain circumstances, be able to seek further review from the servicer if the borrower believes that the waterfall has been misapplied.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, review for non-home retention options may provide a valuable sorting function to the short sale market. Currently, a borrower who has been denied a loan modification and who is attempting to complete a short sale may proceed with little guidance from a servicer regarding whether the borrower will be eligible for a short sale. A short sale involves identifying a potential purchaser and working to obtain funding and a transaction that may be acceptable to an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan even before a determination regarding whether an owner or assignee would potentially consider a short sale. By requiring an evaluation for non-home retention options simultaneously with the evaluation for home retention options, the Bureau creates a process by which a borrower that is denied a home retention option will be told whether the borrower is eligible for a non-home retention option, such as a short sale. Borrowers who are told that they are eligible for a short sale may better undertake the effort necessary to reach a viable sale, and may make the market for short sale transactions more efficient by obtaining servicer agreement to consider a short sale transaction. Further, concurrent evaluation reduces the risk that borrowers do not pursue options that may be available as a result of exhaustion with the loss mitigation process.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added commentary to § 1024.41(c)(1) to clarify a servicer's obligation to evaluate a complete loss mitigation application for all loss mitigation options available from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Comment 41(c)(1)-1 states that the conduct of a servicer's evaluation with respect to any loss mitigation option is in the discretion of the servicer. A servicer meets the requirements of § 1024.41(c)(1)(i) if the servicer makes a determination regarding the borrower's eligibility for a loss mitigation program. Consistent with § 1024.41(a), because nothing in section 1024.41 should be construed to resolve whether borrower can enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or provision of, any loss mitigation option, § 1024.41(c)(1) does not require that an evaluation meet any standard other than the discretion of the servicer. Accordingly, the Bureau intends that the requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan sets forth the procedure that must be followed by servicers but does not create, in itself, a requirement that a servicer conduct such evaluation in any particular manner. Accordingly, the Bureau does not intend to create a private right of action to enforce the guidelines of any owner or assignee's loss mitigation program, including any HAMP requirements or GSE requirements, as a consequence of this requirement. Servicers should take note, however, that, pursuant to § 1024.38, above, and independent of the requirements of § 1024.41, a servicer may be required to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of properly evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 41(c)(1)-2 states that a servicer should evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options for which a borrower may qualify based upon eligibility criteria applicable to each loss mitigation option, as established by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, a servicer services mortgage loans for two different investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Those investors or guarantors each have different loss mitigation programs. A servicer is only required to evaluate the borrower for loss mitigation options offered by the owner or assignee of a borrower's mortgage loan and is not required to evaluate a borrower for any other program implemented by a mortgage servicer for an owner or assignee that is different than the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Further, if a servicer services mortgage loans for an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that has established pilot programs, temporary programs, or programs that are limited by the number of participating borrowers, a servicer is only required to evaluate whether a borrower is eligible for any such program consistent with criteria established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, if an owner or assignee has limited a pilot program to a certain geographic area or to a limited number of participants, a servicer should evaluate the borrower in accordance with any such restrictions, which may include an owner or assignee's determination not to include the borrower in the pilot program or among the group of participants applying for a limited option.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>Evaluation of Incomplete Loss Mitigation Applications</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes it is appropriate to clarify the impact of the loss mitigation procedures when a borrower submits an incomplete loss mitigation application. As set forth above, the definition of a loss mitigation application is expansive. When a borrower begins the process by submitting a loss mitigation application, a servicer should be required to work with that borrower to make the loss mitigation application complete, and thereby assure the borrower receives the protections set forth in § 1024.41. Accordingly, § 1024.41(c)(2)(i) states that a servicer shall not evade the requirement to evaluate a complete loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, including, for example, by offering an individual loss mitigation option based upon an evaluation of borrower's incomplete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1 clarifies that § 1024.41(c)(2)(i) does not prohibit a servicer from offering a loss mitigation option to a borrower that has not submitted a loss mitigation application. Further, a servicer may offer a borrower that has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application a loss mitigation option, but only if the offer of the loss mitigation option is not based on an evaluation of the individual borrower's circumstances. Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1 provides, for example, that if a servicer offers trial loan modification programs to all borrowers that become 150 days delinquent without an application or consideration of any information provided by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application, the servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of section 1024.41 with respect to any such trial loan modification program for any borrower that has not submitted a loss mitigation application or that has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application. The example complies with § 1024.41(c)(2) because the offer of the loss mitigation option is based on a standard practice and not on an evaluation of any information or documents submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-2 clarifies that although a review of a borrower's incomplete loss mitigation application is within a servicer's discretion, and is not required by § 1024.41, a servicer may be required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(v), to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Such evaluation may be subject to requirements applicable to loss mitigation applications otherwise considered incomplete pursuant to § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that some borrowers may submit incomplete loss mitigation applications and may not submit the documents or information necessary to make those applications complete. The Bureau believes that the best approach for servicers to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41 is to work with borrowers to make incomplete loss mitigation applications complete and servicers have an obligation to undertake reasonable diligence in this regard. However, where such diligence has failed, the loss mitigation procedures should not serve as an impediment to working with borrowers that are not able to complete the loss mitigation application requirements. Accordingly, § 1024.41(c)(2)(ii) provides that notwithstanding § 1024.41(c)(2)(i), if a servicer has exercised reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application, but a loss mitigation application remains incomplete for a significant period of time under the circumstances without further progress by a borrower to make the loss mitigation application complete, a servicer may, in its discretion, evaluate an incomplete loss mitigation application and determine to offer a borrower a loss mitigation option. Any such evaluation and offer is not subject to the requirements of § 1024.41 and shall not constitute an evaluation of a single complete loss mitigation application for purposes of § 1024.41(i). The Bureau has further added comment 41(c)(2)(ii) to clarify the meaning of a significant period of time under the circumstances. Any such circumstances may include consideration of the relative timing of the foreclosure process. Thus, a delay of 10 or 15 days in providing documents or information to make a loss mitigation complete may be more significant if the period is close to a potential foreclosure sale than such period would be if it were to occur early in the foreclosure process, including, for example, in the time period that is less than 120 days of delinquency.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(d) would have required that servicers comply with additional obligations with respect to a denial of a borrower's loss mitigation application with respect to trial or permanent loan modification options. A servicer would have been required to provide any such borrower a written notice stating the specific reasons for the determination and inform the borrower of the right to appeal the servicer's determination pursuant to proposed § 1024.41(h). The notice would have included the deadline for filing the appeal and any requirements for pursuing the appeal, such as, for example, forms or documents the borrower must file in connection with the appeal process. Further, proposed comments 41(d)(1)-1 and 41(d)(1)-2 would have provided examples regarding the information that should be included in the specific reasons provided to the borrower in the notice when a borrower is denied a loan modification on the basis of an investor requirement or a net present value calculation. The Bureau stated that it believed such information would assist borrowers in providing appropriate and relevant information to servicers in connection with the appeal process. Further, such requirements were consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement.<footnote ref="179">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See United States of America&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; at Appendix A, at A-27, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>

              <analysisParagraph>Consumers and consumer advocacy group commenters generally supported the requirements in § 1024.41(d). One such commenter stated that the requirement would further the goal of protecting consumers against discriminatory servicing practices because the required notice would likely discourage those practices. A consumer advocacy group commented that the notification requirement should be expanded to all loss mitigation programs beyond loan modifications and a coalition of consumer advocacy groups commented that servicers should be required to provide specific information and documents about the investor denial to borrowers. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room were concerned that servicers misrepresented that investor requirements barred a loan modification when no such restriction existed and sought fuller disclosure in that regard.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters submitted various requests for clarification regarding § 1024.41(d). Two credit unions and their trade associations, as well as a consumer advocacy group, requested clarification regarding the impact of the required notification regarding a denial of a loan modification option with the adverse action notice required by Regulation B when a consumer report is used in connection with a denial for a loan modification option. Further, the GSEs requested clarification regarding whether the offer of an alternative loss mitigation option (such as a forbearance or repayment plan) constitutes a denial of a loss mitigation option. Finally, a financial industry trade association requested clarification regarding whether servicers could use the “check-the-box” model clauses adopted by the Making Home Affordable Program to communicate with borrowers regarding denials of loss mitigation options pursuant to § 1024.41(d).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.41(d) as proposed, with technical changes to clarify that the requirement applies to complete loss mitigation applications and that loan modification options refers to programs offered by the applicable owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. In light of the comments, the Bureau believes that adjustments to the commentary are warranted. The Bureau is adjusting comments 41(d)(1)-1 and 41(d)(1)-2 as set forth below, and adding comments 41(d)(1)-3 and 41(d)(1)-4.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, pursuant to § 1024.41(d), a servicer that denies a borrower's complete loss mitigation application for any trial or permanent loan modification option available from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan shall state in the notice provided to the borrower pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) the specific reasons for the servicer's determination for each such trial or permanent loan modification program; and, if applicable, that the borrower may appeal the servicer's determination for any such trial or permanent loan modification option, the deadline for the borrower to make an appeal, and any requirements for making an appeal. Importantly, § 1024.41(d) provides special rules for those loss mitigation options that involve loan modifications. With respect to those options, the servicer is required to provide the borrower with the specific reasons for denying the borrower for each trial or permanent modification for which the borrower was considered and, if applicable, notice of the borrower's right to appeal. However, under § 1024.41(d), a servicer is not required to disclose to a borrower a denial for a loss mitigation option that is not a loan modification program (for non-loan modification options, such denial is implicit in the servicer's failure to offer such a loss mitigation option).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to identifying the reasons for a servicer's denial of a borrower for a loan modification option, the Bureau recognizes the consumer frustration resulting from servicer statements that investor requirements or net present value tests bar a loan modification option when the proper application of such purported requirements or tests may or may not actually result in such a determination. To assist consumer understanding, and to effectuate the appeal process, the Bureau believes that servicers that deny a loan modification option on the basis of an investor requirement or net present value model must provide additional detail to support such statements. Accordingly, the Bureau has adjusted comment 41(d)(1)-1 to state that if a trial or permanent loan modification option is denied because of a requirement of an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the requirement that is the basis of the denial. A statement that the denial of a loan modification option is based on an investor requirement, without additional information specifically identifying the relevant investor or guarantor and the specific applicable requirement, is insufficient. However, where an investor or guarantor has established a waterfall and a borrower has qualified for a particular option on the waterfall, it is sufficient for the servicer to inform the borrower, with respect to other options further down the waterfall that the investor's requirements include the use of a waterfall and that a determination to offer an option on the waterfall necessarily results in a denial for any other options below the option for which the borrower has qualified, to the extent applicable for any such option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau has adjusted comment 41(d)(1)-2 to provide that if a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must include all the inputs used in the net present value calculation, rather than just the limited inputs identified in the proposed commentary.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also added comments to address the form of the notice required by § 1024.41(d). No specific format is required for the notice provided pursuant to § 1024.41(d). Accordingly, servicers may determine the appropriate form, so long as the form includes the content required pursuant to § 1024.41(d). Comment 41(d)(1)-3 clarifies that a servicer may combine other notices required by applicable law, including, without limitation, a notice with respect to an adverse action, as required by Regulation B (12 CFR 1002 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.</em>), or a notice required pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with the notice required pursuant to section 1024.41(d), unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, servicers may develop standard language and forms that are appropriate to comply with this section. The Making Home Affordable Program has promulgated model clauses that servicers operating pursuant to that program may use in communications with borrowers regarding denials of applicable loan modification options. Those clauses are set forth in Appendix A to the Making Home Affordable Program Handbook.<footnote ref="180">Making Home Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages, Version 4.0, August 17, 2012, available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/programs/docs/hamp_servicer/mhahandbook_40.pdf&lt;/em&gt; (last accessed January 18, 2012).</footnote>
            Without endorsing the use of those model clauses in any instance, the model clauses adopted by the Making Home Affordable Program may be appropriate for use in specific circumstances.<footnote ref="181">The model clauses set forth in Appendix A of the Making Home Affordable Program Handbook are not incorporated by reference in Regulation X and do not provide servicers a safe harbor pursuant to section 19(b) of RESPA.</footnote>
            A servicer is responsible for monitoring whether the use of the model clauses is accurate and appropriate for any individual borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, comment 41(d)(1)-4 clarifies that any determination not to offer a loan modification option, notwithstanding whether a servicer offers a borrower a different loan modification option or other loss mitigation option, constitutes a denial of a loan modification option. Thus, if a servicer offers a borrower a forbearance option or repayment plan after evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application, any such offer, without an offer of a loan modification option, constitutes a denial for a loan modification option and a servicer shall provide the disclosures required pursuant to § 1024.41(d) with respect to any loan modification program available to the borrower. Again, to the extent a waterfall was the basis for the determination, the disclosure may state, for example, that the investor's requirement do not permit a borrower to receive a loan modification offer if a determination is made that the borrower has the capacity to repay the mortgage with forbearance or repayment, along with an explanation of the reasons for the conclusion that the borrower can do so with a forbearance plan.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has adjusted the applicable timelines as discussed above. The proposed rule would have provided that a borrower must have no less than 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option. This requirement has been changed to set two stages of deadlines: (1) If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale, a borrower shall have at least 14 days to accept or reject the offer of a loss mitigation option, and (2) if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application less than 90 days but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale, a borrower shall have at least 7 days to accept or reject the offer of a loss mitigation option. As discussed above, the 14 day timeline requirement is consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and certain State law requirements. Further, the secondary 7-day timeline is designed to implement appropriate procedures for timing scenario 3, discussed above. Nothing in the rule would preclude a servicer who considers an application received less than 37 days before a foreclosure sale to offer the borrower a loss mitigation option and require a response in less than 7 days.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added § 1024.41(e)(2)(i), to set forth the general rule that a servicer may deem that a borrower that has not accepted an offer of a loss mitigation option within the deadlines established pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) to have rejected that offer. This general rule is subject to the exceptions provided in § 1024.41(e)(2)(ii) and (e)(2)(iii). This provision finalizes the provision previously set forth in proposed § 1024.41(e)(3).

            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that the requirement that a servicer consider a borrower that has made the first payment for a loss mitigation option to have accepted the option is infeasible as proposed. The Bureau finds persuasive the arguments made by commenters regarding the necessity of clear contractual arrangements, as well as, potential issues posed by various State law statutes of frauds. Accordingly, the Bureau has substantially modified, and separately enumerated, this requirement, which was previously set forth in proposed § 1024.41(e)(2), as § 1024.41(e)(2)(ii). Pursuant to § 1024.41(e)(2)(ii), and consistent with the requirement suggested by servicers and their trade associations, a borrower that does not comply with the servicer's requirements for accepting a trial loan modification plan, but submits the payments that would be owed pursuant to any such plan, shall be provided a reasonable period of time to fulfill any remaining requirements of the servicer for acceptance of the trial loan modification plan beyond the time period established pursuant to § 1024.41(e)(1).

              <title>41(e)(2)(iii) Interaction With Appeal Process</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that the requirement that a servicer permit a borrower to both accept an offer of a loss mitigation option and appeal the denial of a different loan modification option is infeasible as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau agrees that it is infeasible to require a servicer to implement a loss mitigation option, only to potentially have to back out of the implementation of such option and implement a different loss mitigation option after an appeal has been determined. Accordingly, the Bureau has modified this requirement and separately enumerated the requirement, which was previously set forth in proposed § 1024.41(e)(4), as § 1024.41(e)(2)(iii). Proposed § 1024.41(e)(4) is withdrawn.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to § 1024.41(e)(2)(iii), and consistent with the requirement suggested by a large bank servicer, if a borrower makes an appeal of a denial of a loan modification option pursuant to § 1024.41(h), the borrower's deadline for accepting a loss mitigation option offered pursuant to § 1024.41(c) shall be extended to 14 days after the servicer provides the notice required pursuant to § 1024.41(h)(4). Accordingly, a borrower will be able to have an appeal reviewed and receive the servicer's decision regarding the appeal before a borrower will be required to accept any offer of a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, if an appeal is granted, the borrower will have 14 days to determine whether to accept the loss mitigation option offered as a result of the appeal or any other previous offer made pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii). If an appeal is denied, the borrower will have 14 days to determine whether to accept an offer for another loss mitigation option previously offered pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii). A borrower may voluntarily determine to accept an offer of a loss mitigation option and withdraw an appeal at any time.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(e) would have imposed standards for when a borrower is considered to have accepted or rejected a loss mitigation option offered by a servicer. The proposal stated that a servicer may impose requirements on the manner in which a borrower must accept or reject a loss mitigation option, subject to standards for acceptance and rejection set forth in the rule. The proposed rule would have provided that a borrower must have no less than 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option. Further, the proposed rule would have clarified that if a servicer has not received a response from a borrower to an offer of loss mitigation after 14 days, the servicer may deem the borrower's lack of a response as a rejection of the loss mitigation option. A 14-day timeframe for a borrower to respond to an offer of a loss mitigation option is consistent with GSE requirements, the National Mortgage Settlement, certain State laws, and Federal regulatory agency requirements.<footnote ref="182">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See United States of America&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bank of America Corp.,&lt;/em&gt; at Appendix A, at A-17, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com&lt;/em&gt; ; Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide &amp;#167; 64.6(d)(5) (2012); Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide &amp;#167; 103.04 (2012); 2012 Cal.

Moreover, Fannie Mae servicing guidelines provide a servicer's review of a borrower's application for a loss mitigation option must not exceed 30 days and that if a servicer receives a borrower response package before 37 days prior to the foreclosure sale date, no delay in legal action is required, unless an offer is made and the foreclosure sale is within the borrower's 14-day response period. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 103.04, 107.01.02 (2012).</footnote>
            The proposed rule also would have provided that if a borrower does not satisfy the servicer's requirements for accepting a loss mitigation option, but submits the first payment that would be owed pursuant to any such loss mitigation option within the deadline established by the servicer, the borrower was to be deemed to have accepted the offer of a loss mitigation option. This presumption was intended to maintain consistency with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Numerous commenters, including large bank servicers, non-bank servicers, community banks, credit unions, their trade associations, and the GSEs objected to allowing a borrower to accept a loss mitigation option by submitting a payment. Two financial industry trade associations and a community bank indicated that compliance with the statute of frauds, as well as investor contracts, requires written acceptance of a loss mitigation option, and the lack of a written agreement would create unjustified risks for servicers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans. A non-bank servicer stated that allowing acceptance by payment would only work for trial loan modification plans, and then only if subject to future documentation. The commenter stated that written agreements must be required for permanent loan modifications, short sales, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreements, and longer term repayment plans.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, a large bank servicer, a credit union, and two industry trade associations commented that it would be impractical to allow a borrower to accept a loss mitigation offer while simultaneously appealing an offer of a loan modification option. A large bank servicer suggested instead that the time for accepting the loss mitigation option should be suspended until after an appeal has been considered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has revised § 1024.41(e) in response to the comments as set forth below.

              <title>41(f) Prohibition on Foreclosure Referral</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(f) would have required servicers to comply with the loss mitigation procedures by reviewing complete and timely loss mitigation applications before a servicer could proceed with a foreclosure sale. Timely applications included complete loss mitigation applications submitted within a deadline established by a servicers, which could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. By prohibiting servicers from proceeding to a foreclosure sale while a complete and timely loss mitigation application is pending, the proposed rule would have addressed one of the most direct consumer harms relating to concurrent evaluation of loss mitigation options and prosecution of foreclosure proceedings. The proposed rule also would have prohibited a servicer from moving forward with a foreclosure sale while the borrower was performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau received a significant number of comments from consumer advocacy groups regarding dual tracking of evaluation of loss mitigation options and foreclosure processing. These comments generally stated that borrowers should have the opportunity to be reviewed for a loss mitigation option before a servicer begins a foreclosure process. Further, consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments stating that although the Bureau's proposal would address harms resulting from a foreclosure sale, other harms to consumers relating to dual tracking were not addressed by the proposed rule. These included consumer harms resulting from participating in the foreclosure process, including confusion from receiving inconsistent and confusing foreclosure communications while loss mitigation reviews are on-going. Such confusion potentially may lead to failures by borrowers to complete loss mitigation processes, or impede borrowers' ability to identify errors committed by servicers reviewing applications for loss mitigation options that may have more beneficial consequences for borrowers as well as owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, borrowers may be negatively impacted because borrowers are responsible for accruing potentially unnecessary foreclosure costs while an application for a loss mitigation option is under review. These costs burden already struggling borrowers and may impact the evaluation for a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As stated above, consumer advocacy group commenters recommended that the Bureau restrict servicers from pursuing the foreclosure process as well as evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation on dual tracks. Twelve individual consumer advocacy groups as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups stated that the Bureau should require servicers to undertake loss mitigation evaluations, including loan modification reviews and offers, prior to beginning the foreclosure process. Further, three consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should create a defined pre-foreclosure period of 120 days before a borrower can be referred to foreclosure, and that servicers should perform a mandatory review of a borrower for loss mitigation options during this period.
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also addressed whether the Bureau should implement protections relating to dual tracking apart from the prohibition on foreclosure sale set forth in the proposal. Outreach with servicers and their trade associations, indicated general support for maintaining consistency among any “dual tracking” requirements established by the Bureau and the National Mortgage Settlement. A law firm commented that Bureau requirements with respect to “dual tracking” should model the National Mortgage Settlement. Notably, a community bank and its trade association commented that as a consequence of the Bureau's regulations on loss mitigation procedures, servicers may try to begin foreclosures as soon as possible after delinquency in order to preserve flexibility to comply with the loss mitigation procedures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed more fully in the opening of the discussion of § 1024.41, the Bureau is persuaded by the comments that the potential harm to consumers of commencing a foreclosure proceeding before the consumer has had a reasonable opportunity to submit a loss mitigation application or while a complete loss mitigation application is pending is substantial. The fact that the GSEs and the National Mortgage Settlement defer commencing foreclosure proceedings until a borrower has had a reasonable opportunity to apply for a loss mitigation option is further persuasive that such a restriction on the commencement of foreclosure proceedings would further the consumer protection purposes of RESPA and would not present a significant risk of unintended consequences.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further believes it is necessary and appropriate for borrowers, servicers, and courts to have a known early period during which a servicer shall not begin the foreclosure process. The Bureau also believes that a servicer should not be permitted to begin the foreclosure process when there is a pending complete loss mitigation application and believes that such a requirement, unless coupled with a restriction on when the foreclosure process can begin, might incentivize servicers to begin the foreclosure process earlier than would otherwise occur to avoid delay resulting from the submission of a complete loss mitigation application. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to implement the consumer protection purposes of RESPA by barring servicers from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process if a borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application before any such filing. The Bureau further believes it is necessary and appropriate to implement the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to bar servicers from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process if a borrower is not more than 120 days delinquent in order to provide the borrower sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau understands and intends that any such requirement will preempt State laws to the extent such laws permit filing of foreclosure actions earlier than after the 120th day of delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, § 1024.41(f) implements these prohibitions. First, pursuant to § 1024.41(f)(1), a servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless a borrower's mortgage loan obligation is greater than 120 days delinquent. Second, pursuant to § 1024.41(f)(2), if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application during the pre-foreclosure review period set forth in paragraph (f)(1) or before a servicer has made the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, a servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless the borrower is not eligible for any loss mitigation option (and any appeal is inapplicable or has been exhausted), has rejected all offers of loss mitigation options, or has failed to comply with the terms of an agreement on a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also added comment 41(f)(1)-1 to clarify the prohibition on making the first notice or filing required by applicable law. Per comment 41(f)(1)-1, the first notice or filing required by applicable law refers to any document required to be filed with a court, entered into a land record, or provided to a borrower as a requirement for proceeding with a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process. Such filings include, for example, a foreclosure complaint, a notice of default, a notice of election and demand, or any other notice that is required by applicable law in order to pursue acceleration of a mortgage loan obligation or sale of a property securing a mortgage loan obligation.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>41(g) Prohibition on Foreclosure Sale</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(g) would have required that if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application by a deadline established by a servicer that was no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale, the servicer may not proceed to foreclosure sale unless: (1) The servicer denies the borrower's application for a loss mitigation option and the appeal process is inapplicable, the borrower has not requested an appeal, or the time for requesting an appeal has expired; (2) the servicer denies the borrower's appeal; (3) the borrower rejects a servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option; or (4) a borrower fails to perform pursuant to the terms of a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau stated that it is appropriate to require that if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application by the deadline established by the servicer, a servicer should not proceed with a foreclosure sale until the servicer and borrower have terminated discussions regarding loss mitigation options. Further, the Bureau stated that it is appropriate to suspend a foreclosure sale when a borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. A servicer's basis for servicing a mortgage loan, and undertaking actions to collect on an unpaid obligation, emanates from the contractual relationship between the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the borrower. A servicer's determination to hold a foreclosure sale when a borrower is performing under an agreement that forestalls foreclosure violates the agreement entered into with the borrower. Additionally, it is already standard industry practice for a servicer to suspend a foreclosure sale during any period where a borrower is making payments pursuant to the terms of a trial loan modification. The Bureau stated in the proposal that prohibiting a servicer from proceeding with a foreclosure sale until termination of the loss mitigation discussion will eliminate the clearest harms to borrowers resulting from servicers' pursuit of loss mitigation and foreclosure proceedings concurrently.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 41(g)(4)-1 and 41(g)(4)-2 would have clarified the application of the borrower performance definitions with respect to short sales. As stated in the proposal, a short sale typically will include a listing or marketing period during which a servicer will agree to postpone a foreclosure sale in order to allow a borrower to market a property for a short sale transaction. The proposed comments stated that a borrower is considered to be performing under the terms of a short sale agreement, or other similar loss mitigation agreement, during the term of any such marketing or listing period, and any time subsequent to such periods, if a short sale transaction is approved by all relevant parties, and the servicer has received proof of funds or financing.
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry trade associations as well as consumer advocacy groups supporting a prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale while a loss mitigation application is pending or an appeal from a loan modification denial is pending. Numerous consumer advocate commenters also stated, as discussed above with respect to § 1024.41(f), that the Bureau should go further to bar servicers from beginning or continuing with a foreclosure process even before a foreclosure sale. Specifically, a consumer advocate stated that a servicer should be barred from proceeding to foreclosure judgment in a judicial foreclosure, not just from completing a foreclosure sale, because of the difficulty in delaying a foreclosure sale once a foreclosure judgment has been rendered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Conversely, a credit union trade association, a non-bank servicer, and an individual consumer stated that the Bureau should not implement regulations that may have the impact of further delaying the foreclosure process. An individual consumer indicated that regulations that delay foreclosure will reduce access to credit and disproportionately increase costs of credit for low and moderate income households and first time homebuyers. Further, a non-bank servicer stated that borrower action should not be required before a servicer can proceed to foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, a non-bank servicer requested clarification regarding application of the prohibition to a short sale. Specifically, the commenter requested clarification regarding whether a servicer can proceed with a foreclosure sale if a property does not sell during a listing or marketing period for a short sale transaction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau finalizes the rule as proposed with three adjustments. First, the Bureau has adjusted the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale to state that a servicer shall not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale. Second, the Bureau has adopted further clarification regarding the impact of the requirements on short sale transactions. Third, the Bureau has adjusted the timing of the requirement consistent with other changes to the timing of § 1024.41 generally, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes it is consistent with the purposes of RESPA, as well as with current market practice, to prohibit a servicer from completing the foreclosure process if a borrower has submitted a timely and complete application for a loss mitigation option until the servicer has completed the evaluation of the borrower for a loss mitigation option. In light of current market practice, the Bureau does not believe that § 1024.41(g) will have a substantial impact on expected foreclosure timelines. Significantly, the Bureau has structured the timelines for borrowers to submit complete loss mitigation applications, and for servicers to evaluate loss mitigation applications, consistently with the National Mortgage Settlement, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, and requirements currently imposed on servicers that service mortgage loans for the GSEs or government lending programs. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that the Bureau's requirements will substantially impact foreclosure timelines separate and apart from the baseline established as a result of current market practices. The Bureau also believes that avoiding the consumer harm caused by conducting a foreclosure sale before a servicer has completed an evaluation of a borrower for a loss mitigation option justifies any remaining concern regarding the potential impact on foreclosure timelines.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to clarify that the prohibition on conducting a foreclosure sale includes a prohibition that a servicer shall not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale. The final rule clarifies servicer obligations in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions and, moreover, is consistent with the requirements imposed on certain servicers under the National Mortgage Settlement.<footnote ref="183">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; National Mortgage Settlement at Appendix A, at A-18, available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding commentary to clarify the impact of this requirement on the foreclosure process. Comment 41(g)-1 clarifies the impact of the prohibition on moving for foreclosure judgment by dispositive motions. Specifically, comment 41(g)-1 states that the prohibition on a servicer moving for judgment or order of sale includes making a dispositive motion for foreclosure judgment, such as a motion for default judgment, judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, which may directly result in a judgment of foreclosure or order of sale. If a servicer has made any such motion before receiving a complete loss mitigation application, a servicer should make a good faith attempt to avoid the issuance of a judgment on any such motion prior to completing the procedures required by § 1024.41. In addition, comment 41(g)-2 clarifies how servicers may proceed with a foreclosure process. As stated in comment 41(g)-2, nothing in 1024.41(g) prohibits a servicer from continuing to move forward with a foreclosure process (assuming that the first notice or filing was made before a servicer received a complete loss mitigation application) so long as the servicer does not take an action that will directly result in the issuance of a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or a foreclosure sale. For example, if a servicer is required to engage in mediation or to make publications in a local paper, a servicer may proceed with any such requirements, so long as the applicable result of a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct of a foreclosure sale does not result from such action. The Bureau has also added comment 41(g)-3, which provides that a servicer is responsible for promptly instructing foreclosure counsel retained by the servicer not to proceed with filing for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or to conduct a foreclosure sale, in violation of § 1024.41(g) when a servicer has received a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also clarified the application of § 1024.41 with respect to loss mitigation applications submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale in comment 41(g)-4. Comment 41(g)-4 clarifies that although a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements in § 1024.41 with respect to a loss mitigation application submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale, a servicer is required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(v), to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options for which the borrower may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Such evaluation may be subject to requirements applicable to a review of a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also agrees that clarity is warranted regarding the impact of the requirements of § 1024.41(g)(3) on short sale transactions. The Bureau is finalizing comments 41(g)(3)-1 and 41(g)(3)-2, the substance of which was previously proposed as comments 41(g)(4)-1 and 41(g)(4)-2.<footnote ref="184">These comments had been identified as 41(g)(4)-1 and 41(g)(4)-2 in the proposal but have been relocated in light of a non-substantive adjustment to the numeration of § 1024.41(g).</footnote>
            Comment 41(g)(3)-1 provides that a borrower is deemed to be performing under an agreement on a short sale, or other similar loss mitigation option, during the term of a marketing or listing period. Further comment 41(g)(3)-2 states that a borrower should be deemed to have obtained an approved short sale transaction if a short sale transaction has been approved by all relevant parties, including the servicer, other affected lienholders, or insurers, if applicable, and the servicer has received proof of funds or financing, unless circumstances otherwise indicate that an approved short sale transaction is not likely to occur. The Bureau has revised comment 41(g)(3)-2 in light of the public comments to further provide that if a borrower has not obtained an approved short sale transaction at the end of any marketing or listing period, a servicer may determine that a borrower has failed to perform under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. Finally, the Bureau has adjusted the timing requirements for § 1024.41(g) consistent with the discussion above regarding timelines.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(h) would have required a servicer to establish an appeals process to review denials of complete loss mitigation applications for loan modifications. Pursuant to proposed § 1024.41(h), if a servicer reviewed an appeal and determined to offer a loss mitigation option, the servicer would have been prohibited from proceeding with a foreclosure sale unless the borrower rejects the offer of the loss mitigation option or fails to comply with terms of the loss mitigation option. If a servicer denied a borrower's appeal of a loss mitigation option, the servicer would have been permitted to proceed with a foreclosure sale.

              <analysisParagraph>The appeals process would have been limited to denials of loan modification options. The Bureau stated in the proposal that an appeal process for denials of loan modification options maintains consistency with existing appeals and escalation processes established under State law or Federal regulatory agency requirements. For example, the appeal processes established by the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights relate to denials of first lien loan modification denials.<footnote ref="185">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; National Mortgage Settlement, at Appendix A, at A-27, available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com; see also&lt;/em&gt; 2012 Cal.

            Moreover, loan modifications are some of the most complex loss mitigation programs with respect to the evaluation of borrowers, and the Bureau stated that loan modifications provide an appropriate scope for an appeal process. The Bureau requested comment regarding the appeal requirements, including the impact of the appeal process on small servicers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocates commented that the scope of the appeal process should be expanded beyond loan modifications to include appeals of denials for any loss mitigation option. A consumer advocate further stated that there should be transparent standards for appeals, requirements on the information that servicers must review, and disclosure to the consumer of the reasons an appeal was denied. A housing counselor supported the appeal process requirement but requested clarification regarding the timing of the deadlines. The commenter suggested using a postmark to determine when applicable timelines start.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>By contrast, industry commenters objected to the appeal process requirement. A credit union and a trade association stated that many investors, including the GSEs and government insurance programs, do not consider appeals and that requiring a second review is ultimately futile and wasteful. A law firm commented that the appeal process is unnecessary and overreaching because it is unreasonable to believe that servicers will not comply with current loss mitigation evaluation requirements. Further, the commenter stated that an appeals process will extend foreclosure timelines, which may ultimately harm the housing market without benefiting consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The GSEs commented that they also generally oppose an appeal process but emphasized that, in any event, an appeal process should be limited to a denial of a loan modification option and only where a loss mitigation application is submitted 90 days or more before a scheduled foreclosure sale. A Federal regulatory agency further commented that instead of a formal appeal process, the Bureau should provide a less formalized escalation process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Credit unions and their trade associations, as well as a community bank and a non-bank servicer, commented that the appeal process presents unique issues for small servicers. These commenters stated that small servicers could not implement the appeal process because small servicers generally have so few employees that it is not possible to assign a separate employee to handle an appeal. One trade association commented that, as a consequence, an appeal may be reviewed by staff that may not be appropriate to the task. A credit union and a credit union trade association also commented that supervisory personnel should be allowed to conduct appeals.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to require servicers to respond to appeals of denials for loan modification options. The Bureau's proposed requirement is consistent with other obligations imposed on servicers, including, as set forth above, obligations pursuant to the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Right. Consumers have consistently and forcefully complained that servicers have failed to review borrowers for loan modification options authorized by investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Significantly, consumers and consumer advocates dispute in many individual instances whether servicers have properly applied the requirements of the Making Home Affordable program and the loan modification review requirements of the National Mortgage Settlement. Further, the terms of loan modification program reviews and compliance are complex and the Bureau understands from outreach with investors and guarantors of mortgage loans that servicers continue to have difficulty conducting the evaluations for loan modification programs pursuant to the guidelines and programs established by those investors and guarantors. Considering these factors, the Bureau believes that, as with any complex and unique process, servicers may make mistakes in evaluating borrowers for loan modification options. The notice that the Bureau is requiring servicers provide borrowers to explain the reasons for the denial of a loan modification, which include inputs that may have been the basis for such denials, may help uncover such mistakes. Many of these mistakes can then be corrected if a servicer undertakes a second review where a borrower believes that such further review is warranted. Thus, the Bureau believes that borrowers may reasonably benefit from the opportunity to have an independent review at a servicer where the borrower believes a mistake was made in the evaluation of a loan modification option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau believes the scope and requirements of the appeal process as proposed are appropriate. The Bureau proposed limiting the scope of the appeal process to denials of loan modification options. Further, the appeal process would only have been available if a complete loss mitigation application was received 90 days or more before a scheduled foreclosure sale. These requirements are consistent with appeals processes set forth in the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and set an appropriate balance of processes that improve consumer protection when considered against burdens that may impact access and costs of credit for consumers. Although commenters focused on whether the process should be characterized as an “appeal” process or an “escalation” process, this semantic distinction does not affect the actual requirements that would be imposed on servicers. Essentially, if a borrower believes that a servicer made a mistake regarding the evaluation of a borrower for a loan modification option, the borrower can indicate that to the servicer. The servicer would be required to ensure that personnel other than those that made the initial determination review the borrower's evaluation and determine whether to offer the borrower a loss mitigation option. The Bureau also believes the timing of the loss mitigation procedures, including the appeal process, are clear. All such deadlines are based on when information is received or provided by a servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau believes that servicers should review borrower appeals and make a determination regarding whether the servicer shall offer the borrower a loss mitigation option, the Bureau declines to establish guidelines for appeals. As set forth above, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to allow investors or guarantors, including most notably the GSEs and FHA, to establish their own requirements and to determine the extent to which they want those requirements to be enforceable through private litigation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau finalizes § 1024.41(h) as proposed, with minor changes to reflect adjustments to the deadlines applicable to § 1024.41 generally, as discussed above, and certain non-substantive changes to clarify the text. Further, the Bureau finalizes comment 41(h)(3)-1 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>41(i) Duplicative Requests</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(i) would have clarified that a servicer is only required to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1024.41 for a single complete loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower. A servicer would not have been required to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1024.41 if a borrower had previously been evaluated for loss mitigation options for the borrower's mortgage loan account by that servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau stated that where servicing was transferred after the borrower received an evaluation on a complete loss mitigation application from the transferor servicer, the transferee servicer still may be required to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1024.41. The Bureau believes that when an investor or guarantor is transferring servicing to a new servicer, which may have been driven by an investor's or guarantor's determination that the new servicer can better achieve loss mitigation options with borrowers, borrowers should be able to renew an application for a loss mitigation option with the transferee servicer, subject to the applicable deadlines and requirements in proposed § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment regarding whether a borrower should be entitled to renewed evaluation for a loss mitigation option if an appropriate time period has passed since the initial evaluation or if there is a material change in the borrower's circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A consumer advocate coalition commented that servicers should be required to review a subsequent loss mitigation submission when a borrower has demonstrated a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances. Conversely, a trade association supported the Bureau's proposal stating that it would ensure that adequate time and resources are devoted to borrowers applying for the first time for a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A non-bank servicer stated concerns that requiring review of renewed applications would obstruct a servicer's ability to proceed with an inevitable foreclosure sale. The commenter indicated that renewed applications may not actually reflect a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances and may only constitute a strategic attempt to delay the foreclosure process. The commenter suggested that if a servicer is required to review a renewed loss mitigation application, a borrower should have a restricted time period for submitting such information and a servicer should only be required to comply with an expedited review process. Finally, after further consideration, the Bureau believed it appropriate to clarify the application of the loss mitigation procedures if servicing is transferred for a borrower's mortgage loan account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the requirements in § 1024.41 to a review of a single complete loss mitigation application. Specifically, the Bureau believes that a limitation on the loss mitigation procedures to a single complete loss mitigation application provides appropriate incentives for borrowers to submit all appropriate information in the application and allows servicers to dedicate resources to reviewing applications most capable of succeeding on loss mitigation options. Further, the Bureau is cognizant that the borrowers may pursue a private right of action to enforce the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 and significant challenges exist to determine whether a material change in financial circumstances has occurred and, if so, what procedures should be required. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing the rule as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees, however, that there is merit to providing protections for a borrower that has had a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances after a review of an initial loss mitigation application. Accordingly, as discussed above for § 1024.38(b)(2)(v), servicers are required to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. The Bureau understands from outreach that many owners or assignees of mortgage loans require servicers to consider material changes in financial circumstances in connection with evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options and servicer policies and procedures must be designed to implement those requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to clarify the application of the requirements of § 1024.41 when servicing for a mortgage loan has been transferred. As set forth in the proposal, a transferee servicer would have been required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41, notwithstanding whether a borrower has received a determination on a complete loss mitigation application from a transferor servicer. To the extent that an evaluation for a loss mitigation option is in process with a transferor servicer, but a borrower has not finalized an agreement on a loss mitigation option, the Bureau believes it is appropriate for a transferee servicer to comply with the loss mitigation procedures, including reviewing a borrower again for all available loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau, therefore, has added comments 41(i)-1 and 41(i)-2 to clarify a transferee servicer's obligations in connection with a servicing transfer for a borrower that has submitted a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(i)-1 provides that a transferee servicer is required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41 regardless of whether a borrower received an evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application from a transferor servicer. Further, comment 41(i)-1 states that documents and information transferred from a transferor servicer to a transferee servicer may constitute a loss mitigation application to the transferee servicer and may cause a transferee servicer to be required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41 with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account. Comment 41(i)-2 states that a transferee servicer must obtain documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application pending at the time of a servicing transfer, consistent with policies and procedures adopted pursuant to § 1024.38, and must continue the evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application to the extent practicable. Comment 41(i)-2 further provides that for purposes of § 1024.41(e)(1), 1024.41(f), 1024.41(g), and 1024.41(h), a transferee servicer must consider documents and information received from a transferor servicer that constitute a complete loss mitigation application for the transferee servicer to have been received by the transferee servicer as of the date such documents and information were provided to the transferor servicer. The purpose of this clarification is to ensure that a servicing transfer does not have the consequence of depriving a borrower of protections to which a borrower was entitled from the transferor servicer in accordance with the requirements of § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau finalizes § 1024.41(i) as proposed. The Bureau finalizes the comments to § 1024.41(i) to clarify the impact of the requirements in § 1024.41 in connection with servicing transfers.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>41(j) Other Liens (Withdrawn)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1024.41(j) would have required any servicer that receives a complete loss mitigation application to determine if any other servicers service mortgage loans that have senior or subordinate liens encumbering the property that is the subjection of the loss mitigation application within 5 days. If a servicer determines that any other servicers service a mortgage loan for the property, the servicer would be required to provide the loss mitigation application received from the borrower to the other servicer. This provision was intended to require servicers of other liens that were not the original recipient to become engaged in the loss mitigation evaluation process by requiring such servicers to apply the loss mitigation procedures to loss mitigation applications received from other servicers on behalf of the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Numerous commenters, including large banks, community banks, credit unions, their respective trade associations, the GSEs, a law firm, and a housing finance agency, objected to the proposed rule. These commenters stated that the proposed rule raises significant concerns regarding consumer welfare. First, the required transmittal of borrower personal information among servicers raises significant privacy concerns for borrowers. Second, borrowers that are current on other mortgage loans may be harmed by requiring information sharing among mortgage servicers. For example, a borrower that is current on a subordinate lien HELOC that is not fully utilized may find that the HELOC line has been frozen even though the borrower expects to need to draw on the additional credit that would have been available. Third, servicers would be required to undertake the expense of a title search to identify other liens, the costs for which would be passed on to a borrower, even though a borrower likely knows whether another lien and servicer exist.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters also stated that servicers could not reasonably comply with the proposed rule. Servicers indicated that they could not identify whether other mortgage liens exist from a title search within 5 days. A small credit union commented that credit unions lack the expertise, staffing, and training to ensure compliance with the requirement. Commenters also identified other operational problems, including delays and logistical problems identifying appropriate personnel to receive loss mitigation applications at other servicers, and problems relating to exchanging potentially proprietary information relating to collecting information for a loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters suggested different approaches for involving servicers of other mortgage liens in loss mitigation evaluations. A financial industry trade association suggested that the Bureau require servicers to inform borrowers that they may wish to contact a servicer for another mortgage loan to obtain an evaluation for a loss mitigation option. Another industry commenter suggested that the Bureau sponsor a database for exchanging lienholder information and submitting and storing borrower applications. Further, a consumer advocate coalition suggested that the Bureau implement requirements regarding re-subordination of a junior lien after a loan modification. Specifically, the commenter states that a servicer should be required to secure a re-subordination of a junior lien to a modified mortgage loan secured by a senior lien. The commenter further states that a servicer should be prohibited from rejecting a loan modification even where a title problem exists or where another lienholder refuses to re-subordinate its lien to a modified mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some of the most difficult loss mitigation situations for consumers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans involve properties secured by multiple mortgage liens. Loss mitigation options for such properties can be significantly impeded or delayed because of miscommunications, lack of coordination, and differing interests among servicers of senior and subordinate liens. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, when servicers hold a second lien that is behind a first lien owned by a different owner or assignee, one study has found a lower likelihood of liquidation and modification, and a higher likelihood of inaction by a servicer. Specifically, “liquidation and modification of securitized first mortgages are 60 percent [to] 70 percent less likely respectively and no action is 13 percent more likely when the servicer of that securitized first mortgage holds on its portfolio the second lien attached to the first mortgage.”<footnote ref="186">Sumit Agarwal &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et al., Second Liens and the Holdup Problem in First Mortgage Renegotiation&lt;/em&gt; (Dec. 14, 2011), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt; available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=2022501&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.41(j) to require servicers to coordinate on evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options. However, commenters have identified significant concerns with the requirement as proposed. For example, with respect to privacy concerns, the Bureau observed in the proposal that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as implemented by Regulation P did not require provision of an initial notice and opt-out in connection with providing the loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower to another servicer under the exception set forth in 12 CFR 1016.15(a)(7). However, notwithstanding that servicers may provide personal information to additional servicers pursuant to applicable law, the Bureau finds persuasive the concerns raised by servicers with respect to the potential privacy implications regarding the circulation of borrower personal information among servicers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of the comments, the Bureau has determined to withdraw the substance of proposed § 1024.41(j). The Bureau is requiring that a servicer inform a borrower in the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options. Although a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements that would have been implemented by proposed § 1024.41(j), the Bureau believes that borrowers should be aware of the potential complications to achieving a loss mitigation option in situations where multiple liens exist.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>41(j) Small Servicers</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As previously stated above, the proposed rule applied all of the loss mitigation provisions to small servicers. For the reasons previously discussed with respect to § 1024.30, the Bureau has concluded that the available evidence indicates that the concerns underlying the loss mitigation provisions arise in the context of larger servicers and that the benefits of applying all of these requirements to small servicers who service loans they or an affiliate own or originated may not be justified by the burdens on these small servicers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>There are, however, two elements of the loss mitigation rules that the Bureau believes should be applied across all servicers. First, new § 1024.41(j) states that a small servicer is required to comply with requirements similar to those in § 1024.41(f)(1) by not making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent. Second, a small servicer shall not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, if a borrower is performing pursuant to the terms of an agreement on a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has no reason to believe that any small servicers, servicing loans they or an affiliate owns or originated, in fact commence foreclosure before a borrower is at least 120 days delinquent or either commence a foreclosure process or conduct a foreclosure sale if a borrower is performing under an agreed-upon loss mitigation program. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes these protections, which are discussed in more detail above, are such essential standards that all borrowers should understand that they are entitled to protection from consumer harms relating to dual tracking notwithstanding the size of the servicer. The Bureau believes that imposing only these limited requirements on small servicers creates easily understood and clearly implemented consumer protections while appropriately calibrating the burdens that small servicers may incur.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1024.41 Loss mitigation procedures</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the Bureau's 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, and in part II above, there has been widespread concern among mortgage market participants, consumer advocates, and policymakers regarding pervasive problems with servicers' performance of loss mitigation activity in connection with the financial crisis, including lost documents, non-responsive servicers, and unwillingness to work with borrowers to reach agreement on loss mitigation options. In response, servicers, investors, guarantors, and State and Federal regulators have undertaken efforts to adjust servicer loss mitigation and foreclosure practices to address problems relating to evaluation of loss mitigation options. Specifically: (1) Treasury and HUD sponsored the Making Home Affordable program, which established guidelines for Federal government sponsored loss mitigation programs such as HAMP;<footnote ref="159">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;www.makinghomeaffordable.gov&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            (2) the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to align their guidelines for servicing delinquent mortgages they own or guarantee to improve servicing practices;<footnote ref="160">Press Release, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to Align Guidelines for Servicing Delinquent Mortgages (Apr. 28, 2011), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/21190/SAI42811.pdf&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; Comment letter submitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</footnote>
            (3) prudential regulators, including the Board and the OCC, undertook enforcement actions against major servicers, resulting in consent orders imposing requirements on servicing practices;<footnote ref="161">Press Release, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, NR 2011-47, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;OCC Takes Enforcement Action Against Eight Servicers for Unsafe and Unsound Foreclosure Practices&lt;/em&gt; (Apr. 13, 2011); Federal Reserve Board Press Release, Federal Reserve Issues Enforcement Actions Related to Deficient Practices in Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing (April 13, 2011), available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/enforcement/20110413a.htm&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>

            and (5) a number of States have adopted, and others continue to propose, regulations relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing, including requiring evaluation for loss mitigation options.<footnote ref="163">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; N.Y.

          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Many of these initiatives imposed a similar set of consumer protective practices on covered servicers with respect to delinquent borrowers. For example, the FHFA servicing alignment initiative, the National Mortgage Settlement, and HAMP all require servicers to review loss mitigation applications within 30 days.<footnote ref="164">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; National Mortgage Settlement at Appendix A, at A-26; Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide, Vol. 2 &amp;#167; 64.6(d)(5) (2012); Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide &amp;#167; 205.08 (2012); HAMP Guidelines, Ch. 6 (2011).</footnote>
            Further, the FHFA servicing alignment initiative and the National Mortgage Settlement require a servicer that receives an application for a loss mitigation option from a borrower before the 120th day of delinquency to postpone the referral of the borrower's mortgage loan account to foreclosure until the borrower has been evaluated for a loss mitigation option.<footnote ref="165">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; National Mortgage Settlement at Appendix A, at A-17, available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com&lt;/em&gt; (last accessed January 15, 2013).</footnote>

            <analysisParagraph>While these various initiatives are starting to bring standardization to significant portions of the market, none of them to date has established a set of consistent national procedures and expectations regarding loss mitigation procedures. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, observing that the mortgage servicing industry was unprepared and poorly structured to address the rapid increase in defaults and foreclosures, recommended that federal regulators establish national mortgage servicing standards to address structural vulnerability in the mortgage servicing market.<footnote ref="166">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Financial Stability Oversight Council, 2011 Annual Report (July 22, 2011), available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/FSOCAR2011.pdf&lt;/em&gt; (last accessed January 15, 2013).</footnote>
            Further, the GAO recommended that to the extent federal regulators create national servicing standards, such standards should address servicer foreclosure practices.<footnote ref="167">U.S. Government Accountability Office, Mortgage Foreclosures—Documentation Problems Reveal Need for Ongoing Regulatory Oversight (May 2011), available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/317923.pdf&lt;/em&gt; (last accessed January 15, 2013).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to these recommendations, the Bureau has developed these final rules to serve as national mortgage servicing standards. The Bureau believes that because so many borrowers are more than 90 days delinquent and in need of consideration for loss mitigation, because borrowers often are not able to choose the servicer of their mortgage loan, and because the manner in which loss mitigation is handled has such potentially significant impacts on both individual consumers and the health of the larger housing market and economy, establishing national mortgage servicing standards is necessary and appropriate to protect borrowers and achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. Such standards establish appropriate expectations for loss mitigation processes for borrowers and for owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Such standards also ensure that borrowers have a full and fair opportunity to receive an evaluation for a loss mitigation option before suffering the harms associated with foreclosure. These standards are appropriate and necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including facilitating borrowers' review for loss mitigation options, and to further the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure a fair, transparent, and competitive market for mortgage servicing.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, the Bureau has considered a number of different options for addressing consumer harms relating to loss mitigation. In general, the Federal government has at least three approaches to addressing loss mitigation: (1) Establishing processes to facilitate actions by market participants; (2) mandating outcomes of loss mitigation process (implicitly raising costs to market participants of pursuing foreclosure actions in violation of the mandated outcomes); or (3) providing subsidies to incent the desired outcomes.<footnote ref="168">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Patricia A. McCoy, Barriers to Home Mortgage Modifications During the Financial Crisis, at 4 (May 31, 2012).</footnote>
            Only options (1) and (2) were considered by the Bureau in light of resources and other factors. These present a stark choice: Whether to mandate processes that provide consumer protections without mandating specific outcomes or whether to mandate specific outcomes by establishing criteria for when such outcomes are required. For example, a requirement that a servicer review a completed loss mitigation application in a certain time period establishes a process requirement but does not impose upon the servicer a criterion for determining whether to offer a loss mitigation option. In contrast, a requirement that a servicer provide a loan modification when an evaluation of a loss mitigation application indicates that a loan modification may have a positive net present value would impose a substantive criterion. Mandating a methodology or set of assumptions for determining when a modification has a positive net present value would further constrain the investor's discretion in deciding under what circumstances to offer a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal included proposed procedural requirements for servicers to follow in reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options. Specifically, proposed § 1024.41 provided that servicers that make loss mitigation options available to borrowers in the ordinary course of business must undertake certain duties in connection with the evaluation of borrower applications for loss mitigation options. The proposal was intended to achieve three main goals: First, it was designed to provide protections to borrowers to ensure that, to the extent a servicer offers loss mitigation options, a borrower would receive timely information about how to apply, and that a servicer would evaluate a complete application in a timely manner. Second, it was designed to prohibit a servicer from completing a foreclosure process by proceeding with a foreclosure sale until a borrower and a servicer had terminated discussions regarding loss mitigation options.<footnote ref="169">Although there is a paucity of reliable data about the prevalence of problems resulting from proceeding with a foreclosure sale while loss mitigation discussions are ongoing, the Federal Reserve identified anecdotal evidence of these problems in 2008. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Larry Cordell &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et al., The Incentives of Mortgage Servicers: Myths and Realities,&lt;/em&gt; at 9 (Federal Reserve Board, Working Paper No. 2008-46, Sept. 2008).

For example, the NCLC conducted a survey of consumer attorneys to identify instances of foreclosure sales occurring while loss mitigation discussions were on-going. Per that survey, 80 percent of surveyed consumer attorneys surveyed reported an instance of an attempted foreclosure sale while awaiting a loan modification. National Consumer Law Center &amp;amp; National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Servicers Continue to Wrongfully Initiate Foreclosures: All Types of Loans Affected&lt;/em&gt; (Feb. 2012), available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/foreclosure_mortgage/mortgage_servicing/wrongful-foreclosure-survey-results.pdf&lt;/em&gt;. Further, a survey by the National Housing Resource Center stated that 73 percent of 285 housing counselors surveyed rate servicer performance in complying with dual tracking rules outlined in HAMP guidelines as &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;poor.&amp;#8221; National CAPACD Comment Letter, at 7. These surveys, while certainly not conclusive evidence of the prevalence of dual tracking or compliance with requirements imposed on servicers, indicate that concurrent loss mitigation and foreclosure processes continue to negatively impact borrowers.</footnote>
            Third, it was designed to set timelines for loss mitigation evaluation that could be completed without requiring a suspension of the foreclosure sale date in order to avoid strategic use of these procedures to extend foreclosure timelines.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau intended that the protections that were set forth in proposed § 1024.41 would have been augmented and supplemented by protections in other sections of the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal that addressed loss mitigation issues. In proposed § 1024.39, for instance, the Bureau proposed to implement obligations on servicers that would have required servicers to contact borrowers early in the delinquency process and to provide information to borrowers regarding loss mitigation options. In proposed § 1024.40, the Bureau proposed to implement obligations on servicers that would have required servicers, in certain circumstances to provide borrowers with contact personnel to assist them with the process of applying for a loss mitigation option. Such personnel would have been required to have access to, among other things, information regarding loss mitigation options available to the borrower, actions the borrower must take to be evaluated for such loss mitigation options, and the status of any loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower. Further, in proposed § 1024.38, the Bureau proposed to require that servicers implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options. Finally, in proposed § 1024.35, the Bureau proposed to permit a borrower to assert an error as a result of a servicer's failure to postpone a scheduled foreclosure sale when a servicer has failed to comply with the requirements for proceeding with a foreclosure sale. The Bureau believed that all of these protections, when implemented together, would have a substantial impact on reducing consumer harm.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment on all aspects of the proposal, and, in particular, whether focusing on the provision of procedural rights was the appropriate approach to addressing the consumer harm it had identified. The Bureau sought comment on whether there were additional appropriate measures that could be required to improve loss mitigation outcomes for all parties. The Bureau also sought comment on whether the proposed requirements ensured that consumers' timely and complete applications would receive fair and full consideration and ensured the predictability of outcomes for consumers as well as owners and assignees of mortgage loans. Finally, and as discussed further below, the Bureau sought comment on whether proposed § 1024.41 would have required servicers to undertake practices that conflicted with other Federal regulatory requirements or State law or may have caused servicers to undertake practices that might reduce the availability of loss mitigation options or access to credit.<footnote ref="170">With respect to investor or guarantor requirements that do not constitute Federal or State law, such as requirements of the GSEs, the Bureau observes that such entities may need to review and adjust their requirements in light of the consumer protections set forth in the final rules.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from numerous individual consumers, consumer advocates, as well as some servicers and industry trade associations in support of the Bureau's implementation of loss mitigation procedures. Although many of these commenters indicated specific areas where adjustments to the proposed requirements might be warranted, a number of commenters indicated that the loss mitigation procedures proposed by the Bureau would provide necessary and appropriate tools to assist consumers in receiving evaluations for loss mitigation options. Other commenters disagreed with the Bureau's proposed approach with respect to loss mitigation requirements. Numerous consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau's proposed requirements were inadequate to address consumer harm, and that the Bureau should more aggressively regulate loss mitigation activities. Conversely, the majority of industry participants and their trade associations commented that the proposed requirements were burdensome, unnecessary to address consumer harm, and could create an incentive for servicers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans to withdraw current loss mitigation practices.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups primarily commented on three main topics: (1) Mandating specific loss mitigation criteria; (2) addressing consumer harms relating to dual tracking of processes for pursuing foreclosures and evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation; and (3) appropriate timelines for the loss mitigation procedures. These topics are addressed in turn below. In certain circumstances, because the Bureau's approach to loss mitigation is not limited to the loss mitigation procedures set forth in § 1024.41, but involves a coordinated use of tools set forth in different provisions of the mortgage servicing rules (including the error resolution procedures in § 1024.35, the reasonable information management policies and procedures in § 1024.38, the early intervention requirements in § 1024.39, and the continuity of contact requirements in § 1024.40), the Bureau has implemented adjustments to other provisions in light of the comments received with respect to the loss mitigation procedures in § 1024.41 as discussed further below and in the discussions of the other sections as appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Mandating Specific Loss Mitigation Criteria</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments requesting that the Bureau mandate criteria for loss mitigation programs. For example, twelve individual consumer advocacy groups, as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups, commented that the Bureau's proposal to require loss mitigation procedures did not go far enough to protect consumers from harms relating to the loss mitigation process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many consumer advocate commenters set forth a list of goals that should be considered by the Bureau to guide the development of a fuller set of consumer protections relating to the loss mitigation process. These goals included: (1) The Bureau should mandate specific home-saving strategies, with affordable loan modifications ranked first and with an order of priority among types of modifications (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.</em> temporary or permanent interest rate reduction, extension of term, reduction of principal, <em data-original="E-03">etc.</em>); (2) the Bureau should require all servicers to offer affordable, net present value positive loan modifications to qualified homeowners facing hardship and should establish rules for determining what constitutes an affordable modification by establishing a maximum or target debt-to-income ratio;<footnote ref="171">One commenter added that servicers should be required to demonstrate that these models are accurate and do not result in discriminatory impacts.</footnote>
            (3) the Bureau should require that successful trial loan modifications must be automatically converted to permanent modifications by servicers;<footnote ref="172">The commenters indicated that they believed servicers unduly delayed conversion of trial modifications to permanent modifications and stated that homeowners should not bear the financial burden of undue delay in conversion of a trial modification to a permanent modification.</footnote>
            and (4) the Bureau should require servicers to notify homeowners regarding the status of evaluations for loss mitigation options in writing. Notably, one commenter stated that the Bureau should require that if a homeowner is ineligible for a loan modification option, a servicer should fully explore non-home retention options, such as cash-for-keys or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, with the homeowner before a foreclosure is filed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Mandatory loan modifications were addressed by a number of other comment submissions. A coalition of 60 consumer advocacy groups further commented that the Bureau should require loan modification programs similar to HAMP using a public and transparent net-present-value test mandated by the Bureau. One consumer advocacy group commented that a servicer should be required to offer loss mitigation when the servicer is a participant in a Federal, State, or private loss mitigation program or process. Further, one commenter stated that servicers should be prohibited from offering loss mitigation options that grossly deviate from standard industry practices. Finally, individual consumers that participated in a discussion of the proposed rules in connection with the Regulation Room project commented that the Bureau should mandate specific loan modification programs and requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, three consumer advocacy groups expressly stated that the Bureau should not mandate specific loan modification programs and requirements. Although these groups advocated that the Bureau should mandate that all servicers engage in loss mitigation procedures and “include loan modifications that reduce payments to an affordable level as one of the loss mitigation options generally available to borrowers,” these groups recommended against prescribing specific loss mitigation criteria, specified waterfalls or debt-to-income targets, or net present value models or assumptions. Rather, these groups stated that servicers should be given discretion to implement loss mitigation programs. These groups did urge, however, that servicers should be responsible for implementing loss mitigation programs consistent with the requirements imposed by owners or assignees of mortgage loans with respect to the administration of those programs.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast with consumer advocates, industry commenters stated that regulations concerning loss mitigation procedures will limit the availability of loss mitigation options and restrict the availability of credit. Specifically, a community bank, a credit union, and a non-bank mortgage lender commented that mandating outcomes would be a disincentive to offering loss mitigation programs. Further, these commenters indicated that such programs would be costly and burdensome to implement. Further, a number of servicers, their trade associations, and a law firm stated that allowing a private right of action for loss mitigation options would substantially increase costs for lenders, limit the offering of loss mitigation options, and more generally, restrict the availability of credit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments, the Bureau has decided to refrain at this time from mandating specific loss mitigation programs or outcomes. The Bureau continues to believe that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to implement required procedures for servicers' evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options and that this approach will maintain consumer access to credit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that mandating specific loss mitigation programs or outcomes might adversely affect the housing market and the ability of consumers to access affordable credit. Even in its current constrained state, the mortgage market generates approximately $1.4 trillion dollars in new loans.<footnote ref="173">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Laurie Goodman, Outlook and Opportunities U.S. RMBS Market (October 2012) (estimated originations through the first six months of 2012 were approximately $777 billion; originations for CY2011 were approximately $1.308 trillion). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; Mortgage Bankers Association, MBA Increases Originations Estimate for 2012 by Almost $200 Billion (May 24, 2012) &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/80910.htm.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            The mortgage market necessarily depends on a large number of creditors, investors, and guarantors who are willing to accept the credit risk entailed in mortgage lending. The market is constrained today at least in part because, in the wake of the financial crisis, private capital is largely unwilling to accept that risk without a government guarantee.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As with any secured lending, those who take the credit risk on mortgage loans do so in part in reliance on their security interest in the collateral. When a borrower is unable (or unwilling) to repay a loan, it is in the interest of those who own the loans to attempt to mitigate (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> reduce) their losses. There are myriad options, ranging from forbearance, to loan modification, to short sales, to foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to achieve that end. Further, there is a wide range of borrower situations regarding which the borrower and owner or assignee of the mortgage loan must make judgments as to the desirable options. And for any given situation with respect to a borrower's willingness and ability to pay, there are a large number of issues to resolve in determining how to structure a particular option, such as a forbearance plan, loan modification, or short sale.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that different creditors, investors, and guarantors have differing perspectives on how best to achieve loss mitigation based in part on their own individual circumstances and structures and in part on their market judgments and assessments. Community banks and credit unions with loans on portfolio may have a different viewpoint, for example, than large investors who purchased mortgage loans on the secondary market. Even government insurance programs adopt approaches that differ in material respects from each other, as well as from those programs implemented by the GSEs.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it can develop, at this time, rules that are sufficiently calibrated to protect the interests of all parties involved in the loss mitigation process and is concerned that an attempt to do so may have unintended negative consequences for consumers and the broader market. Loss mitigation programs have evolved significantly since the onset of the financial crisis and the Bureau is concerned that an attempt to mandate specific loss mitigation outcomes risks impeding innovation, that would allow such programs to evolve to the needs of the market. The Bureau further believes that if it were to attempt to impose substantive loss mitigation rules on the market at this time, consumers' access to affordable credit could be adversely affected. Creditors who were otherwise prepared to assume the credit risk on mortgages might be unwilling to do so, or might charge a higher price (interest rate) because they would no longer be able to establish their own criteria for determining when to offer a loss mitigation option in the event of a borrower's default. Investors in the secondary market might likewise reduce their willingness to invest in mortgage securities or pay less for securities at present rates (thereby requiring creditors to charge higher interest rates to maintain the same yield). The cost of servicing might increase substantially to compensate servicers for the burden of complying with prescribed criteria for evaluation of loss mitigation applications. Based upon these considerations, the Bureau declines to prescribe specific loss mitigation criteria at this time.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is implementing requirements, however, for servicers to evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to guidelines established by the owner or assignee of a borrower's mortgage loan. In order to effectuate this policy, the Bureau has created certain requirements in § 1024.38, with respect to general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements, and other requirements in connection with the loss mitigation procedures in § 1024.41. Pursuant to § 1024.38, servicers are required to maintain policies and procedures to achieve the objective of (1) identifying, with specificity, all loss mitigation options for which borrowers may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by an owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan and (2) properly evaluating a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options for which the borrower may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Further, in § 1024.41, the Bureau is implementing procedural protections for borrowers with respect to the process of obtaining an evaluation for loss mitigation options, as well as restrictions on the foreclosure process while a borrower is being evaluated for a loss mitigation option. Borrowers have a private right of action to enforce the procedural requirements in § 1024.41, as set forth in § 1024.41(a); borrowers do not, however, have a private right of action under the Bureau's rules to enforce the requirements set forth in § 1024.38 or to enforce the terms of an agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan with respect to the evaluation of borrowers for loss mitigation options. The Bureau believes this framework provides an appropriate mortgage servicing standard; servicers must implement the loss mitigation programs established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans and borrowers are entitled to receive certain protections regarding the process (but not the substance) of those evaluations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In reaching the conclusion not to impose substantive requirements on loss mitigation programs, such as eligibility criteria, or to mandate the outcomes of loss mitigation processes, the Bureau recognizes that there is abundant evidence that the current system is not producing a level of loan modifications and other foreclosure alternatives that best meets the interests of distressed borrowers, the communities that would be hurt by borrowers' loss of their homes, and owners or assignees of mortgage loans. To the extent that is the result of process failures by servicers—specifically, the lack of infrastructure to handle the flood of delinquent borrowers resulting from the financial crisis—the Bureau believes that it can best contribute to solving that problem through the rules it is adopting which, as previously discussed, will require servicers to establish policies and procedures governing servicer operations, to implement continuity of contact policies and procedures, to engage in early intervention with delinquent borrowers, and to comply with procedures regarding the evaluation of a borrower for loss mitigation options. Together, these requirements are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To the extent the failure of the current system to produce an optimal level of loss mitigation is the result of servicers pursuing their self-interest rather than the interest of their principals (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans), the Bureau is addressing that issue by requiring servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify all available loss mitigation options of their principals and properly consider delinquent borrowers for all such options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau observes that the vast bulk of delinquent mortgages today are owned or guaranteed by governmental agencies such as FHA or by the GSEs in conservatorship. Those agencies, and the FHFA as conservator for the GSEs, are accountable to the public for meeting their statutory responsibilities to borrowers and taxpayers. The Bureau believes these agencies are best situated to establish loss mitigation programs for their mortgage loans, to determine the extent to which they believe it appropriate to allow individual borrowers to enforce their loss mitigation rules, and to evaluate whether a borrower should be able to obtain judicial review of the decision of a servicer in an individual case to offer a loss mitigation option. If the Bureau were to effectively mandate such review, the Bureau fears that investors and guarantors might dilute the obligations they impose on servicers or the loss mitigation options they make available. Such a result would not serve the interests of consumer or the housing market. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined not to establish substantive criteria for review of loss mitigation programs at this time and not to make investor guidelines with respect to loss mitigation enforceable against servicers by borrowers through RESPA. The Bureau will continue to monitor developments in the market and work with the prudential regulators, as well as other Federal agencies, to assess collectively whether additional rules are necessary and appropriate to improve outcomes for all participants in the mortgage market.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not mandating specific loss mitigation criteria and, instead, is adopting a procedural approach, the Bureau is finalizing the loss mitigation procedures as proposed with significant adjustments, as set forth below, that are designed to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed procedures in light of the public comments. Such adjustments include, for example, expanding the scope of the loss mitigation procedures to apply to all servicers, not just servicers that offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business, adjusting the timelines for the loss mitigation procedures, and implementing protections for borrowers from the harms of dual tracking. Although the Bureau believes that substantially all, if not all, servicers offer loss mitigation options, as defined by the Bureau, in the ordinary course of business, the Bureau acknowledges, and agrees with, comments received from consumer advocates that requiring servicers to comply with the loss mitigation requirements notwithstanding their business practices better achieves the consumer protection purposes of RESPA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As set forth more fully below (and above with respect to § 1024.38), the Bureau is also making adjustments to other sections of the rule to address concerns raised by certain consumer advocate commenters related to loss mitigation. For example, § 1024.38 requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement the loss mitigation program requirements established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Such programs may require servicers to consider whether a borrower's material change in financial circumstances warrants further consideration of the availability of loss mitigation options and may require consideration of loss mitigation applications beyond the timelines required by the Bureau. Although the Bureau has determined not to adjust the loss mitigation procedures requirements in § 1024.41 to address such concerns, the Bureau has made adjustments to the requirements for servicers to adopt policies and procedures in § 1024.38, as set forth above, which has the effect of addressing such concerns.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>Restricting Dual Tracking</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule would have required servicers to comply with the loss mitigation procedures by reviewing complete and timely loss mitigation applications before a servicer could proceed with a foreclosure sale. Timely applications included complete loss mitigation applications submitted within a deadline established by a servicer, which could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. By prohibiting servicers from proceeding to a foreclosure sale while a complete and timely loss mitigation application is pending, the proposed rule would have addressed one of the most direct consumer harms resulting from concurrent evaluation of loss mitigation options and prosecution of foreclosure proceedings.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The comments from consumer advocacy groups regarding dual tracking set forth three distinct themes: (1) Borrowers should have the opportunity to be reviewed for a loss mitigation option before a servicer begins a foreclosure process, (2) borrowers should not receive inconsistent communications relating to, or incur costs for, continuing the foreclosure process when a loss mitigation review is underway, and (3) borrowers should receive the protection of required loss mitigation procedures closer in time to the date of a foreclosure sale than 90 days. The first two of these themes are addressed here and the third is addressed below with respect to timelines.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments stating that although the Bureau's proposal would address harms resulting from a foreclosure sale, other harms to consumers relating to dual tracking were not addressed by the proposed rule. These included consumer harms resulting from participating in the foreclosure process, including confusion from receiving inconsistent and confusing foreclosure communications, while loss mitigation reviews are on-going. Such harm potentially may lead to failures by borrowers to complete loss mitigation processes that may have more beneficial consequences for borrowers as well as owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, borrowers may be negatively impacted because borrowers are responsible for accruing foreclosure costs while an application for a loss mitigation option is under review. These costs burden already struggling borrowers and may impact the evaluation and ultimate outcome for a borrower for a loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>These commenters recommended that the Bureau restrict servicers from pursuing the foreclosure process and evaluating a borrower for loss mitigation options on dual tracks. For example, twelve individual consumer advocacy groups, as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups stated that the Bureau should require servicers to undertake loss mitigation evaluations, including loan modification reviews and offers, prior to beginning the foreclosure process. These commenters further stated that homeowners applying for loss mitigation options after a foreclosure has started should have their foreclosures paused while their files are reviewed, and if needed, appealed, in a timely fashion. Further, three consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should create a defined pre-foreclosure period of 120 days before a borrower can be referred to foreclosure. This period should also have a mandatory review of a borrower before proceeding with foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also addressed whether the Bureau should implement protections relating to dual tracking apart from the prohibition on foreclosure sale set forth in the proposal. Outreach with servicers and their trade associations indicated general support for maintaining consistency among any “dual tracking” requirements established by the Bureau and the National Mortgage Settlement. A law firm commented that the Bureau's requirements with respect to “dual tracking” should model the National Mortgage Settlement. Notably, a community bank and its trade association commented that, as a consequence of the Bureau's regulations on loss mitigation procedures, servicers may try to begin foreclosures as soon as possible after delinquency in order to evade the requirements of the Bureau's loss mitigation procedures and preserve flexibility in handling the foreclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded by the comments that the potential harm to consumers of commencing a foreclosure proceeding before the consumer has had a reasonable opportunity to submit a loss mitigation application or while a complete loss mitigation application is pending is substantial. The fact that the GSEs and the National Mortgage Settlement both prohibit servicers from commencing foreclosure for a specified period of time to afford a borrower a reasonable opportunity to apply for a loss mitigation option is further persuasive that providing borrowers with the same protection would advance the consumer protection purposes of RESPA and would not present a significant risk of unintended consequences.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, in light of the comments, the Bureau has determined to implement restrictions on dual tracking beyond those set forth in the proposal. These restrictions have three main components. First, the Bureau is prohibiting a servicer of a mortgage loan subject to § 1024.41 from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent. After a borrower is 120 days delinquent, a servicer may make the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless the borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application, in which case, the servicer must complete the review and appeal procedures set forth in § 1024.41 before starting the foreclosure process. If a borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option, such as a trial modification, the servicer may not commence the foreclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau is expanding and clarifying the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale. If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application by an applicable deadline, as discussed below, a servicer must complete the loss mitigation procedures before proceeding to a foreclosure judgment, obtaining an order of sale for the property, or conducting a foreclosure sale. As set forth below, the Bureau has clarified that proceeding to a foreclosure judgment includes filing a dispositive motion, such as a motion for a default judgment, judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, which may result in the issuance of a foreclosure judgment. If such a motion is pending when a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application, the servicer should take reasonable steps to avoid a ruling on such motion until completing the loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau is also finalizing the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale if a borrower is performing under a trial modification or other agreed upon loss mitigation option.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Third, as set forth below with respect to timelines, the Bureau is implementing procedures applicable to the evaluation of complete loss mitigation applications submitted by borrowers less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale, but 37 days or more before a foreclosure sale. These procedures expand the protections from the harms of dual tracking to borrowers that submit complete loss mitigation applications closer in time to a foreclosure sale. The Bureau received comments from consumer advocates in states with non-judicial foreclosure processes that operate on relatively short timelines indicating that consumers in such states may not benefit from the protections implemented by the Bureau. The Bureau agrees with these comments and is implementing protections on dual tracking that address different timing scenarios. The Bureau believes that such provisions are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring that consumers in all jurisdictions have an opportunity to submit a complete loss mitigation application and avoid certain of the harms resulting from dual tracking.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not, however, otherwise mandating a pause in foreclosure proceedings if a loss mitigation application is submitted after a foreclosure proceeding has been commenced. Once the foreclosure process is initiated, there are typically timelines for the steps that follow that are established by state law or, in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, by court rules or orders entered in individual cases. Those timelines and steps vary from state to state and even from case to case. Some of these timelines and steps have been implemented to ensure that consumers receive the benefit of disclosures or processes enacted by state law to assist consumers. So long as a servicer does not proceed with a dispositive motion in a foreclosure action, the Bureau does not believe that the benefits that might accrue to borrowers from mandating a pause in a foreclosure proceeding (which pause may last for up to 88 days under the timelines the Bureau is mandating for resolving loss mitigation applications) are justified by the disruption that might result to state court proceedings from a mandated pause and the risk of a loss mitigation application being submitted strategically to delay or derail the foreclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that requiring a pause in foreclosures while a complete loss mitigation application is being considered would create incentives for servicers to address such applications expeditiously. The Bureau believes, however, that the best way to address this issue is by mandating strict deadlines for review of a complete loss mitigation application, as the Bureau is doing, and providing for enforcement of those deadlines through private rights of action. The Bureau also recognizes that a pause could reduce costs to borrowers that would otherwise be incurred for the foreclosure process while a loss mitigation application is under review. However, so long as a servicer adheres to the timelines established by the Bureau, the Bureau does not believe that these costs are likely to be substantial.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Appropriate Timelines for the Loss Mitigation Procedures</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule would have required mortgage servicers to comply with the procedures set forth in proposed § 1024.41 with respect to a complete loss mitigation application that was received by a deadline established by a servicer, which deadline could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. In the proposal, the Bureau stated that a 90-day threshold set an appropriate line because a servicer who received a complete loss mitigation application 90 days before a foreclosure sale would have 30 days to review a borrower's application for a loss mitigation option, would be able to provide the borrower with 14 days to respond to the servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option and/or to file an appeal, would be able to consider any timely appeal during a subsequent 30 day period, and would be able to provide the borrower with an additional 14 days to respond to any offer of a loss mitigation option after an appeal. Thus, with the timeline set forth, a servicer would be able to complete the entire process within 88 days and a 90 day deadline could accommodate completing the process without rescheduling the foreclosure sale. Proposed comment 41(f)-1 would have clarified that where a foreclosure sale had not been scheduled, or where a foreclosure sale could occur less than 90 days after the sale is scheduled pursuant to State law, a servicer should establish a deadline that is no earlier than 90 days before the day that a servicer reasonably anticipates that a foreclosure sale will be scheduled.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although some servicers and a trade association indicated support for the 90 day maximum deadline, in general, commenters indicated substantial disagreement regarding the appropriate deadlines and framework for structuring timing requirements for reviewing loss mitigation applications. A substantial number of consumer advocacy groups objected to the underlying premise of the deadline requirement. In addition to establishing timeframes prior to a foreclosure referral, as discussed above, consumer advocacy groups stated that borrowers should be permitted to provide complete loss mitigation applications less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale and receive the protection of the procedures required by the Bureau. A housing counselor and three consumer advocacy groups indicated that the deadline should be extended until a maximum of 14 days before a foreclosure sale. Another consumer advocacy group stated that the deadline should be no more than 7 days before a foreclosure sale. These commenters further recommended postponing a foreclosure sale if an application received at least 14 days before a sale is still in the review process by 14 days before a sale to allow time for review and appeals. Further, consumer advocacy groups operating in states with non-judicial foreclosure processes with relatively short timelines stated that borrowers may not be able to benefit from the loss mitigation procedures established by the Bureau within the 90-day deadline set forth in the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Conversely, banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers, as well as their trade associations, objected to the proposed 90 day deadline requirement because it would purportedly provide too much time for borrowers to pursue loss mitigation applications. Two credit unions, two large banks, and two non-bank servicers objected to the 90 day deadline on the basis that the rules should encourage borrowers to seek assistance at the earliest possible time while the delinquency may be curable and allow the borrower to retain the home. A non-bank servicer stated that it appreciated the 90 day deadline but indicated that this deadline could be so far after an initial delinquency in certain jurisdictions that it may lead to a borrower submitting an application after so much time has passed that no option could reasonably assist the borrower with curing a delinquency. Further, a non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau implement staged timelines rather than requiring servicers to establish timelines that may be inconsistent with state law.<footnote ref="174">A large bank servicer also commented that in light of the incentives for the borrower, it should not be required to notify a consumer of a deadline so long as the communication with the consumer is not within 90 days of the foreclosure sale.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of the comments, the Bureau has reconsidered the proposed approach to timelines for the loss mitigation procedures and has made certain adjustments. The Bureau is persuaded that, however regrettable, some borrowers simply may not be prepared to come to terms with their situations and explore the availability of loss mitigation options until foreclosure is close at hand. The Bureau also is persuaded that it is necessary, and appropriate, to implement protections for consumers that apply for loss mitigation options closer in time to a foreclosure sale than 90 days. At the same time, the Bureau is cognizant that if applications received at the last moment were allowed to unduly delay a foreclosure from proceeding, there is a risk that the application process could be used tactically to stall foreclosure. Given that foreclosure timelines are already very long in many jurisdictions; given that the Bureau is implementing protections to mandate early communication with borrowers regarding loss mitigation options; and given that the Bureau is prohibiting servicers from proceeding to foreclosure unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent to ensure that borrowers have the opportunity to apply for loss mitigation options early in the delinquency timeline; the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to permit applications provided shortly before a foreclosure sale to delay the foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, as set forth below, instead of setting an overall deadline for the loss mitigation procedures, the Bureau is implementing timelines that provide different loss mitigation processes with differing levels of protection at certain stages of the foreclosure process. These requirements are: (1) Pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2), a servicer must comply with the requirements relating to acknowledgement of a loss mitigation application and notice of additional documents and information required to complete a loss mitigation application for any loss mitigation application received 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale; (2) pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1), a servicer must evaluate within 30 days any complete loss mitigation application received more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale; (3) pursuant to § 1024.41(e)(1), if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale, the servicer must provide the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option; if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale, the servicer must provide the borrower at least 7 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option; and (4) pursuant to § 1024.41(h)(1), a servicer must comply with the appeal process for any complete loss mitigation application received 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale. Applying these timelines together yields four timing scenarios depending upon when a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Scenario 1.</em> If a borrower is less than 120 days delinquent, or if a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent but the servicer has not made the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process, and a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, (2) must allow the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option, and (3) must permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to § 1024.41(h)(1). Further, for all loss mitigation applications received in this timeframe, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. The servicer may not make the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless these procedures are completed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Scenario 2.</em> If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application after a servicer has made the first notice or filing for a foreclosure process, but 90 days or more exist before a foreclosure sale, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, (2) must allow the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option, and (3) must permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to § 1024.41(h). Further, for all loss mitigation applications received in this timeframe, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. The servicer may not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, unless these procedures are completed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Scenario 3.</em> If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application after a servicer has made the first notice or filing for a foreclosure process, and less than 90 days, but more than 37 days, exist before a foreclosure sale, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, and (2) must allow the borrower at least 7 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option. The servicer is not required to permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to § 1024.41(h)(1). Further, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete only if the loss mitigation application was received 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale. The servicer may not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, unless these procedures are completed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Scenario 4.</em> None of the loss mitigation procedures apply to a loss mitigation application, including a complete loss mitigation application, received 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale. Servicers are required, however, pursuant to § 1024.38 to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. As set forth below, nothing in § 1024.41 excuses a servicer from complying with additional requirements imposed by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, the GSEs require servicers to engage in certain procedures to review loss mitigation applications submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale, and servicers may be required by the GSEs to comply with those requirements. The requirement to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan includes timelines established by any such owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Other Servicer Loss Mitigation Requirements</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As set forth above, the Bureau recognizes that servicers have many layers of requirements with which they must comply. These include requirements imposed by owners or assignees of mortgage loans, as well as requirements imposed by State law or pursuant to settlement agreements and consent orders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Notably, certain commenters requested clarification regarding the interaction between the proposed rules and certain existing servicing requirements. The GSEs commented that their processes allow reviews of loss mitigation applications closer in time to foreclosure than the 90 day timeline proposed by the Bureau and requested clarification regarding the impact of the proposed deadlines in the loss mitigation procedures and the GSE requirements. A non-bank servicer also requested clarification regarding the interaction of timelines imposed by the Bureau and existing State or local pre-foreclosure mediation requirements that may require a complete loss mitigation application package in advance of the mediation meeting.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In order to reduce burden to servicers and costs to borrowers, the Bureau has sought to maintain consistency among § 1024.41, the National Mortgage Settlement, FHFA's servicing alignment initiative, Federal regulatory agency consent orders, and State law mortgage servicing statutory requirements. In certain instances, each of these other sources of servicing requirements may be more restrictive or prescriptive than § 1024.41. That is intentional. Section 1024.41 establishes standard consumer protections and provides flexibility for Federal regulatory agency requirements, State law, or investor and guarantor requirements to impose obligations that may be more restrictive on servicers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Servicers should comply with the most restrictive requirements to which they are subject. For example, § 1024.41 imposes requirements with respect to complete loss mitigation applications received more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. This is consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and GSE requirements.<footnote ref="175">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; National Mortgage Settlement., at Appendix A, at A-19.</footnote>
            Notably, the National Mortgage Settlement and GSE requirements impose obligations to conduct an expedited loss mitigation evaluation for servicers with respect to loss mitigation applications received 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale (although in certain circumstances the servicer is not necessarily required to complete the review before foreclosure). Nothing in § 1024.41 prohibits or impedes a servicer from complying with these requirements and servicers may be required to comply with requirements that are more prescriptive than the regulations implemented by the Bureau. Indeed, as noted, § 1024.38 requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of evaluating borrower for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Similarly, if a servicer is required to proactively engage with a borrower to evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option prior to engaging in a mandatory mediation or arbitration process, § 1024.41 does not prohibit a servicer from obtaining a loss mitigation application before such process so long as the servicer complies with the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 with respect to such application.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Legal Authority</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau relies on its authority under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(C), 6(k)(1)(E) and 19(a) of RESPA to establish final rules setting forth obligations on servicers to comply with the loss mitigation procedures in § 1024.41. These loss mitigation procedures are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including by requiring servicers to provide borrowers with timely access to accurate and necessary information regarding an evaluation for a foreclosure avoidance option and to facilitate the evaluation of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Further, the loss mitigation procedures implement, in part, a servicer's obligation to take timely action to correct errors relating to avoiding foreclosure under section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA by establishing servicer duties and procedures that must be followed where appropriate to avoid errors with respect to foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau relies on its authority pursuant to section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial law, including the purposes and objectives of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the Bureau believes that § 1024.41 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objective under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe the rules to ensure that features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the terms of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Appendix MS-2—Model Form for Mortgage Servicing Transfer Disclosure</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Appendix MS-2 to part 1024 sets forth the format for the servicing transfer disclosure required pursuant to section 6(a)(3) of RESPA and proposed § 1024.33(b)(5). The Bureau proposed to revise the model form in appendix MS-2 to significantly reduce the length of the required disclosure to borrowers in connection with mortgage servicing transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting appendix MS-2 substantially as proposed, except as otherwise noted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In its proposal, the Bureau observed that, unless a transferor and transferee servicer coordinate to provide a consolidated disclosure, a borrower will receive substantially similar disclosures in the form of appendix MS-2 from both a transferor servicer and a transferee servicer. The Bureau is concerned that the volume of the disclosure may overwhelm borrowers, who will not focus on the information set forth in the form, while also imposing a burden on servicers to provide lengthy and unnecessary disclosures. Thus, the Bureau proposed to streamline the language of the model form to focus on only the elements of information that a borrower needs in connection with a mortgage servicing transfer, specifically (1) the date of the transfer, (2) contact information for the transferor servicer, (3) contact information for the transferee servicer, (4) applicable dates for when each of the servicers will begin or cease to accept payments, (5) the impact of the transfer on any insurance products and (6) a statement that the transfer does not otherwise affect the terms or conditions of the mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to remove significant discussion in the model form regarding the complaint resolution process and the borrower's rights pursuant to RESPA. Two consumer advocacy groups submitted comment requesting that the Bureau not remove information about a borrower's complaint resolution rights under RESPA. For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.33(b)(4) above, the Bureau is omitting language about complaint resolution from appendix MS-2.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's proposed amendments to appendix MS-2 also would have omitted language informing borrowers of the prohibition in RESPA section 6(d) (as implemented through current § 1024.21(d)(5)). Appendix MS-2 currently informs borrowers, in general, that pursuant to RESPA section 6, during the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by the borrower's old servicer before its due date may not be treated by the new loan servicer as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on the borrower. Upon further consideration, and in light of comment received with respect to the complaint resolution statement, the Bureau believes this information should be retained in appendix MS-2 because the Bureau believes information about misdirected payments is uniquely relevant to borrowers during a servicing transfer (unlike the complaint resolution statement, which the Bureau believes should be made available to borrowers in circumstances that do not necessarily depend on the transfer of servicing). Additionally, in light of its brevity, the Bureau does not believe its inclusion will significantly add to the length of the form. While the Bureau did not test this statement, the Bureau does not believe it is likely to cause confusion or present comprehension problems in light of its simplicity and because it includes language substantially similar to what appears in the current model form. Accordingly, the Bureau has retained the substance of the current statement about late payments and has omitted the prefatory language about a borrower's rights under RESPA section 6 with a more general statement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has amended existing language in the statement that explains that a payment received “before its due date” would not be treated as late to more accurately reflect the requirement in § 1024.33(c)(1). The language appearing in the model form now provides, “Under Federal law, during the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by your old servicer on or before its due date may not be treated by the new servicer as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on you.”
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Consumer testing.</em> To test consumer comprehension of the revised model form proposed by the Bureau, the Bureau contracted with Macro to conduct eight qualitative interviews during one round of consumer testing in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area on November 7, 2012. After reading the notice, all participants understood that they would have to send their payments to a different servicer after the date listed in the notice. All participants saw the contact information for both the transferor and transferee servicers. Most participants also understood the basic relationship between a lender and a servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>During this round of testing, the Bureau was interested in whether participants preferred a form that listed the transferor and transferee servicer contact information in a side-by-side fashion, as opposed to a vertical fashion, as the form proposed by the Bureau would have been formatted. The Bureau expected that listing the transferor and transferee servicers in a side-by-side fashion would enhance consumer comprehension of who the old and new servicers are. To test this, the Macro showed participants the original notice (Version A) and asked participants a series of questions to measure their understanding of the notice. Macro then showed participants a reformatted notice (Version B) and asked which version they preferred. All participants said they preferred Version B. They commented that the format of Version B was easier to read and understand, and that the current and new servicers were easier to identify at a glance.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing appendix MS-2 with substantially the same content as proposed. However, the Bureau has retained, with certain modifications discussed above, language in current appendix MS-2 about the treatment of payments during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer. The Bureau has also reformatted the model form to list the contact information for the transferor and transferee servicers in a side-by-side fashion.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Appendix MS–3—Model Force-Placed Insurance Notice Forms</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add appendix MS-3 to part 1024 to include four model forms that a servicer could use in connection with providing a borrower with information related to force-placed insurance that would have been required by proposed §§ 1024.37(c)(2), (d)(2)(i) and (ii), or (e)(2), as applicable. The Bureau observed in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal that the model forms underwent three rounds of consumer testing. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.37(c)(3), one large bank servicer commended the Bureau for proposing model forms that were thoughtfully designed. Having received no other comment on the design of the model forms, the Bureau is finalizing appendix MS-3 as proposed, except that the content of the model forms in appendix MS-3, as adopted, reflects changes the Bureau made with respect to the §§ 1024.37(c)(2), (d)(2)(i) and (ii), and (e)(2), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed related commentary to appendix MS-3. Proposed comment MS-3-1 would have explained that the model form MS-3(A) illustrates how a servicer may comply with § 1024.37(c)(2). Proposed comment MS-3-2 would have explained that the model form MS-3(B) illustrates how a servicer may comply with § 1024.37(d)(2)(i). Proposed comment MS-3 would have explained that the model form MS-3(C) illustrates how a servicer may comply with § 1024.37(d)(2)(ii). Proposed comment MS-3-4 would have explained that model MS-3(D) illustrates how a servicer may comply with § 1024.37(e)(2). Proposed comment MS-3-5 would have clarified that where the model forms MS-3(A), MS-3(B), MS-3(C), and MS-3(D) use the term “hazard insurance,” the servicer may substitute “hazard insurance” with, as applicable, “homeowners' insurance” or “property insurance.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed commentary. But upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that proposed comment MS-3-1 through 4 are not necessary because the title of each model form in appendix MS-3 already indicates the circumstances under which such model form is to be used. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment MS-3-5 as proposed, but renumbered as comment MS-3-1.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Appendix MS–4—Model Clauses for the Written Early Intervention Notice</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In the 2012 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Proposal, the Bureau proposed model clauses in new appendix MS-4 to illustrate the disclosures that would be required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(1). The Bureau developed the proposed model clauses to encourage the borrower to contact the servicer and provide information about loss mitigation options, foreclosure, and housing counselors. The Bureau developed the proposed clauses based on its own analysis and review of existing notices for delinquent borrowers, such as the HUD “Avoiding Foreclosure” pamphlet.<footnote ref="187">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 24 CFR 203.602; HUD Handbook 4330.1 rev-5, 7-7(G).</footnote>
            Several consumer advocacy groups supported the Bureau's decision to provide model clauses but recommended that the Bureau require standardized notices for all servicers because they were concerned that servicers are not consistent in the way they describe loss mitigation options. Industry commenters generally requested more flexibility in the way the notices are provided. Macro conducted one round of consumer testing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to assess consumer comprehension of the proposed early intervention model clauses. The Bureau also notes that Macro conducted three rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews to test disclosure forms for the Bureau's proposed ARM interest rate adjustment notices, which the Bureau is finalizing in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. The ARM interest rate adjustment notices contained clauses describing loss mitigation options and contact information to access housing counseling resources.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(A) illustrated how a servicer may provide its contact information and how a servicer may request that the borrower contact the servicer, as would have been required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(i) and (ii). Consumer testing indicated that all participants understood from this statement<footnote ref="188">The tested statement provided, “Please contact us. We may be able to make your mortgage more affordable. The longer you wait, or the further you fall behind on your payments, the harder it will be to find a solution.” This was followed by a sample servicer's address and contact information.</footnote>
            that if they were having trouble making their payments, they should contact their bank to see what options may be available.<footnote ref="189">Consumer testing of the servicing transfer notice, discussed above, during the Philadelphia round of testing indicated participants understood the distinction between their servicer and their lender and that this distinction did not present comprehension problems. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to comment MS-2.ii, servicers may freely substitute the words “lender” and “servicer” as appropriate.</footnote>

            Several participants specifically noticed the sentence stating that “The longer you wait, or the further you fall behind on your payments, the harder it will be to find a solution.” These participants said this sentence would make them more likely to contact their bank. Participants generally thought that this statement was similar to a separate statement illustrating how the servicer may inform the borrower how to obtain additional information about loss mitigation options, as would have been required under § 1024.39(b)(2)(iv), as illustrated in proposed MS-4(C).<footnote ref="190">The tested statement provided, “Call us today to learn more about your options and instructions for how to apply.”</footnote>
            Most participants responded positively to these statements and believed that their bank was reaching out towards a solution, although two participants thought that the statements could be more polite or resembled an advertisement rather than a communication from their bank. Separately, during the public comment process, one credit union commenter also noted that the tone in the model notices did not necessarily reflect the way it communicated with their borrowers and requested more flexibility with respect to how the notices are worded.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the clauses required under § 1024.39(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) may be combined into a single clause, as illustrated in Model MS-4(A) that the Bureau is adopting in the final rule. Both clauses in proposed MS-4(C) and MS-4(A) instruct borrowers to contact the servicer to discuss their options, and the statement instructing borrowers to contact their servicer to learn more about how to apply in proposed MS-4(C) is very closely related. The Bureau is not otherwise changing the phrasing of statements as proposed. Most testing participants reacted favorably to the proposed clauses, and the Bureau notes that servicers can make minor modifications to the sample clauses, pursuant to general comment MS-2 to appendix MS. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the model clauses are not required; they only illustrated how the required statements in § 1024.39(b)(2) can be provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Model MS-4(A) contains a bracketed clause stating, “The longer you wait, or the further you fall behind on your payments, the harder it will be to find a solution.” The Bureau has included this statement in brackets because it is optional, but the Bureau is including it as recommended language that the Bureau believes will help encourage borrowers to contact their servicer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau has omitted the clause stating “We may be able to make your mortgage more affordable” from proposed MS-4(A). During consumer testing, participants were concerned that the statement was potentially misleading. The Bureau does not believe this language is necessary to encourage delinquent borrowers to contact their servicer. That statement also appeared in proposed MS-4(B), illustrating proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) (brief description of loss mitigation options). The Bureau has deleted this clause in MS-4(B) for the same reason.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(B) illustrated how the servicer may inform the borrower of loss mitigation options that may be available, as would have been required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii). The proposed clauses in Model MS-4(B) illustrated four commonly offered examples: (1) Forbearance, (2) mortgage modification, (3) short-sale, and (4) deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(B), all participants understood the overall message of the statement—that if they were having difficulty making a mortgage payment, their bank may be able to offer options to help them. After reading the clauses, while participants generally could explain what a forbearance and a loan modification were, only approximately half of the participants could explain “short-sale” and “deed-in-lieu.” All but one of the participants understood the primary difference between options that would let borrowers remain in their homes (forbearance and mortgage modification) and options that would require that the borrower leave their home (short-sale and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure). All participants understood that the fact that they received this notice did not mean that they would necessarily qualify for these options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>During the public comment process, one large servicer requested clarification that servicers only be required to list loss mitigation options to the extent those options are available from the servicer. Another large servicer recommended that clauses illustrating deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and short sales include language noting that lenders may seek a deficiency obligation from the borrower, except in the case of bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not finalizing the Model Clauses proposed as Model MS-4(B). Instead, the Bureau is finalizing MS-4(B) by including clauses substantially similar to ones that the Bureau developed over the course of several rounds of consumer testing of the ARM disclosures contained in § 1026.20, which the Bureau tested prior to publication of the 2012 TILA Mortgage Servicing Proposal and that tested better than the options described in proposed MS-4. The Bureau recognizes that these examples of loss mitigation options may not necessarily accurately reflect a servicer's loss mitigation programs. Thus, comment MS-4-2 explained that the language in Model MS-4(B) is optional, and that a servicer may add or substitute any examples of loss mitigation options the servicer offers, as long as the information required to be disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. The Bureau noted in its proposal that if the servicer offered no loss mitigation options, a servicer may not include Models MS-4(B) and MS-4(C) because including those statements would be misleading.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment MS-4-2 clarifying appropriate use of model clause MS-4(B). The comment explained that Model MS-4(B) does not contain sample clauses for all loss mitigation options that may be available. Comment MS-4-2 also explained that the language in the model clauses contained in square brackets is optional, and that a servicer may comply with the disclosure requirements of § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) by using language substantially similar to the language in the model clauses, or by adding or substituting applicable loss mitigation options for options not represented in these model clauses, as long as the information required to be disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. The Bureau is adopting comment MS-4-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to industry concerns, the Bureau has also added language to comment MS-4-2 to explain that servicers may use clauses to illustrate options to the extent they are available. In addition, the Bureau has clarified that servicers may provide additional detail about the options, provided the information disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. This clarification responds to industry commenters' recommendation to clarify that servicers may explain that the discussion of certain options, such as a short sale, may require deficiency obligations from the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(D) illustrated how a servicer may explain foreclosure and provide the estimated number of days in which the servicer may begin the foreclosure process, as would have been required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v). During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(D), participants had mixed reactions to the foreclosure statement. Participants understood that this notice was intended to provide the consumer with a definition of the term “foreclosure” and to warn them that foreclosure could be a possibility in their future because of a missed payment. However, participants appeared to understand what foreclosure was even before reading this clause. Therefore, they did not appear to learn much from reading the first sentence of this clause.<footnote ref="191">“Foreclosure is a legal process a lender can use to take ownership of a property from a borrower who is behind on his or her mortgage payments.”</footnote>
            A few participants specifically commented that this sentence seemed out of place, because it was a definition rather than a statement specifically about their situation. The Bureau tested a hypothetical estimated 90-150 day timeframe for when foreclosure could occur. When asked when lenders could begin to pursue foreclosure, all participants referred to the 90 to 150 day timeframe in the clause, and understood that this time period would start from the due date of their missed payment. However, at least two participants mistakenly thought that the reference to this time period implied that the foreclosure process could not start sooner than 90 days after the missed payment, despite the fact that the clause states that the process “may begin earlier or later.”<footnote ref="192">This specific question was not asked of all participants, so it is not possible to estimate exactly how many of the participants might have had this misconception.</footnote>
            One participant felt strongly that if it was true that the foreclosure process could start in less than 90 days, then the reference to the “90 to 150 day” time period should be removed from the clause because it was misleading. For the reasons explained in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.39(b)(2) above, the Bureau has omitted the clauses in proposed MS-4(D) that illustrated how a servicer could explain foreclosure and provide the estimated number of days in which the servicer may begin the foreclosure process, as would have been required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(v).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(E) illustrated how the servicer may provide contact information for the State housing finance authority and housing counselors, as would have been required under proposed § 1024.39(b)(2)(vi). During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(E), all participants understood that the purpose of this message was to provide contact information for the Federal government agency identified in the clause.<footnote ref="193">Macro tested a statement including HUD's housing counselor list and phone number because, at the time of testing, the Bureau did not have a web site containing this information.</footnote>
            Contact information for accessing housing counseling resources was also tested during previous rounds of testing of the ARM interest rate adjustment notice. The Bureau is adopting in the final rule the clauses substantially as proposed setting forth contact information for either the Bureau or HUD Web site to access a list of housing counselor or counseling organizations, as well as the HUD telephone number to access the list of HUD-approved counselors. The Bureau is renumbering MS-4(E) as MS-4(C). For the reasons discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.39(b)(2), the Bureau is omitting contact information for State housing finance authorities.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Appendix MS</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Current appendix MS-1 to part 1024 contains a model form that a servicer could use in connection with providing a loan applicant, at the time of application, information about whether servicing of the loan such applicant is applying may be assigned, sold, or transferred at any time while the loan is outstanding, as required by current § 1024.21(b) and (c). Current appendix-MS-2 to part 1024 contains a model from that a servicer could use in connection with providing a borrower with information related to servicing transfers, as required by current § 1024.21(d)(1)(i). The Bureau proposed to modify the current model form that a servicer could use in connection with providing a borrower with information related to servicing transfers in current appendix MS-2. Additionally, the Bureau proposed adding four model forms that a servicer could use in connection with providing a borrower with information related to force-placed insurance that would have been required by proposed §§ 1024.37(c)(2), (d)(2)(i) and (ii), or (e)(2), as applicable, in proposed appendix MS-3 to part 1024, and adding five model clauses that a servicer could use in connection with providing delinquent borrowers with information about loss mitigation options, foreclosures, and housing counselors that would have been required by proposed § 1024.39(b) in proposed appendix MS-4 to part 1024. In adopting the final rule, the Bureau has organized current appendix MS-1, revised appendix MS-2, and new appendices MS-3 and 4 under the heading “Appendix MS.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed official commentary to provide general instructions on how to use model forms and clauses in appendix MS. Specifically, proposed comment 1 to appendix MS would have explained that appendix MS contains model forms and clauses for mortgage servicing disclosures, and that each such model form or clause is designated for use in a particular set of circumstances, as indicated by the title of such model form or clause. Proposed comment 1 to appendix MS would have additionally clarified that although a servicer is not required to use such model forms and clauses, a servicer that uses them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulations with regard to the disclosure requirements connected with such model forms and clauses. Proposed comment 1 to appendix MS would have explained that to use such forms and clauses appropriately, information required by regulation must be set forth in the disclosures. Proposed comment 2 to appendix MS would have explained that servicers may make certain changes to the format or content of the model forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable without losing the protection from liability so long as those changes do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses, and that servicers making revisions to that effect will lose their protection from civil liability. Proposed comment 2 to appendix MS also would have provided examples of changes that the Bureau considered acceptable changes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comments on the appropriateness of proposing official commentary to provide general instructions on how to use model forms and clauses in appendix MS to part 1024. No comments were received on either the substance of the proposed commentary or the appropriateness of using them to provide general instructions on how to use model forms and clauses in appendix MS to part 1024.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>17(k) Timely Payments</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Section 6(g) of RESPA establishes that if the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require a borrower to make payments to a servicer of the loan for deposit into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect to the property, the servicer shall make such payments from the borrower's escrow account in a timely manner as such payments become due. Existing § 1024.21(g) provides that the requirements set forth in § 1024.17(k) govern the payment of such charges. Existing § 1024.17(k)(1) provides that if the terms of a federally related mortgage loan require a borrower to make payments to an escrow account, a servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner (specifically, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty) unless a borrower's payment is more than 30 days overdue. Existing § 1024.17(k)(2) requires servicers to advance funds if necessary to make the disbursements in a timely manner unless the borrower's mortgage payment is more than 30 days past due. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, a servicer may seek repayment from a borrower for the deficiency pursuant to § 1024.17(f).</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed a new § 1024.17(k)(5) to expand the scope of these obligations with regard to continuing a borrower's hazard insurance policy. Specifically, proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) would have required that, notwithstanding § 1024.17(k)(1) and (2), a servicer must make payments from a borrower's escrow account in a timely manner to pay the premium charge on a borrower's hazard insurance, as defined in § 1024.31, unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Thus, proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) would have required a servicer to both advance funds to an escrow account and to disburse such funds to pay a borrower's hazard insurance notwithstanding that a borrower is more than 30 days delinquent.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The proposed requirement would not have applied where a servicer had “a reasonable basis to believe that such insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges” because the Bureau recognized that there were situations where timely payment by a servicer would not be sufficient to continue a policy that had already been canceled or was not renewed for other reasons, such as, for example, risks presented by the condition of the property.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed commentary to clarify the requirements in § 1024.17(k)(5). Specifically, the Bureau proposed to clarify in comment 17(k)(5)-1 that the receipt by a servicer of a notice of cancellation or non-renewal from the borrower's insurance company before the insurance premium is due provides a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Comment 17(k)(5)-2 would have provided three examples of situations in which a borrower's hazard insurance was canceled or not renewed for reasons other than the nonpayment of premium charges, including because the borrower cancelled the insurance policy, because the insurance company no longer writes the type of policy that the borrower carried or writes policies in the area where the borrower's property is located, or because the insurance company is no longer willing to maintain the borrower's individual policy to cover the borrower's property because of a change in risk affecting the borrower's property. Finally, proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3 would have clarified that a servicer that advances the premium payment as required by § 1024.17(k)(5) may advance the payment on a month-to-month basis, if permitted by State or other applicable law and accepted by the borrower's hazard insurance company.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) to protect consumers from the unwarranted force-placement of hazard insurance. Force-placed insurance generally provides substantially less coverage for a borrower's property at a substantially higher premium cost than a borrower-obtained hazard insurance policy, as discussed below in connection with § 1024.37. Section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act demonstrates that Congress was concerned about the unwarranted or unnecessary force-placement of hazard insurance for mortgage borrowers. Section 6(k) of RESPA, as amended by section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act, evinces Congress's intent to establish reasonable protections for borrowers to avoid unwarranted force-placed insurance coverage. Section 1024.17(k)(5), though articulated differently than the protections directly set forth in section 1463, draws directly from Congress's intent as set forth in section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect borrowers from the force-placement of hazard insurance in situations where such force-placement is unwarranted and can be avoided. When a servicer is receiving bills for the borrower's hazard insurance in connection with administration of an escrow account, a servicer who elects not to advance to a delinquent borrower's escrow account to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance, allowing that insurance to lapse, and then advances a far greater amount to a borrower's escrow account to obtain a force-placed insurance policy unreasonably harms a borrower. Section 1024.17(k)(5) implements the purposes of section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect borrowers from the unwarranted force-placement of insurance when a servicer does not have a reasonable basis to impose the charge on a borrower.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Further, considered as a whole, one of the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, is a requirement that servicers must have a reasonable basis for undertaking actions that may harm borrowers, including delinquent borrowers. Section 1024.17(k)(5) furthers this purpose by establishing that servicers may not unnecessarily obtain force-placed insurance in situations where such placement is not warranted, that is, when a servicer is able to maintain a borrower's current hazard insurance in force by advancing and disbursing funds to pay the premiums.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further reasoned that proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) would not increase burdens on servicers generally, because the Bureau understood that many servicers already advance hazard insurance premiums for borrowers with escrow accounts even if the borrowers' mortgage payments are more than 30 days past due. The Bureau also understands that the proposed requirement would benefit owners or assignees of mortgage loans by preventing the placement of costly and unnecessary force-placed insurance policies, the higher costs for which may be recovered from an owner or assignee in the event the property is liquidated.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on all aspects of the proposed escrow advance provision including on whether there should be additional limitations on a servicer's duty to advance funds. For instance, the Bureau sought comments on an alternative approach under which a servicer could not charge a borrower who has an escrow account established to pay hazard insurance for force-placed insurance unless those charges would be less expensive than the charges for reimbursing the servicer for advancing funds to continue the borrower's hazard insurance policy. The Bureau further requested comment regarding whether to require further that any such force-placed insurance policy protect the borrower's interest. In addition, the Bureau observed in the proposal that § 1024.17(k)(5) would only apply when a borrower has an escrow account established to pay hazard insurance, and also invited comments on whether a servicer should be required to pay the hazard insurance premiums on behalf of a borrower who has not established an escrow account to pay for such insurance. Finally, the Bureau further requested comment on whether a servicer should be required to ask such a borrower whether the borrower would consent to the servicer renewing the borrower's hazard insurance and, with the borrower's consent, be required to advance funds to pay such premiums.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and their trade associations varied significantly in their comments with respect to § 1024.17(k)(5). A number of commenters, including a force-placed insurance provider and two trade associations, stated that the proposed requirement was consistent with current industry practice and would not be onerous to implement. For example, one non-bank servicer indicated that it generally advanced funds to escrow and disbursed those funds to maintain hazard insurance so long as it viewed the advances as recoverable, notwithstanding the delinquency status of the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Numerous other servicers and their trade associations, however, objected to the requirement that a servicer timely disburse funds from escrow to pay hazard insurance for borrowers who are delinquent and further that servicers should advance funds to escrow accounts that would then be disbursed to pay hazard insurance. Some industry commenters indicated that force-placed insurance is the appropriate means for insuring a property for a borrower that has not paid for hazard insurance. For example, a national trade association representing property and casualty insurers stated that the inclusion of limitations on force-placed insurance in section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act recognized that an appropriate role exists for force-placed insurance. Some commenters indicated that the procedures for obtaining force-placed insurance, specifically notices provided to borrowers, spur borrower action to communicate with servicers and to obtain insurance. These commenters believe that the threat of forced placement of insurance causes borrowers to obtain hazard insurance to avoid force-placed insurance. If the threat is effective, they argue, servicers should not have to advance funds to escrow accounts for delinquent borrowers. One commenter, a force-placed insurance provider, urged the Bureau to first evaluate the effectiveness of the notices and procedures required by the Dodd-Frank Act before adopting a final rule requiring a servicer to advance funds for borrowers whose mortgage payments were more than 30 days overdue. Finally, one commenter hypothesized that the proposed requirement was intended as a step toward potential future actions by the Bureau to eliminate the force-placed insurance product market.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some servicers and their trade associations questioned the Bureau's authority to require servicers to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. These commenters stated that (1) the Bureau does not have the authority to impose the requirement because it is not specifically set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, (2) section 6(g) of RESPA only applies to insurance required pursuant to the terms of a federally related mortgage loan, whereas the duty to advance funds appeared to apply even for insurance not required by the terms of the loan, and (3) the requirement was an unnecessary exercise of the Bureau's authority to impose additional obligations on servicers pursuant to sections 6(k)(1)(E) and 19(a) of RESPA. Commenters further objected that the requirement to advance funds would require a servicer to provide funds to maintain coverage obtained by a borrower that exceeded the coverage required by the lender, including, for example, coverage for borrower possessions or coverage beyond hazards the lender required to be covered.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some servicers and their trade associations further stated that the requirement to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance would have adverse consequences for servicers, borrowers, and the insurance market. With respect to potential impact on servicers, some commenters indicated that the proposed requirement would create a disincentive to establish escrow accounts. These commenters also indicated that borrowers may incorrectly presume that servicers will advance to escrow accounts for delinquent borrowers to pay all escrow obligations, not just hazard insurance. Further, a credit union trade association commented that requiring disbursements for hazard insurance may deplete funds that may be available to pay other escrow obligations, such as tax liabilities. A commenter stated that a servicer may be responsible for a loss if a hazard insurance provider to whom it has advanced payments denies coverage because a property is vacant and is excluded from coverage; in such a situation, the commenter said that force-placed insurance is necessary because it would cover the loss.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some servicers stated that borrowers may be unjustly enriched at the expense of their servicers by cancelling hazard insurance and obtaining for themselves refunds of premiums that were paid by their servicers. Although the Bureau had attempted to address this concern, which also was raised during the Small Business Review Panel, through proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3, servicers disagreed on the solution. Importantly, one state banking association stated that the risk of moral hazard and unjust enrichment was mitigated by proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3, which permitted the servicer to advance and disburse on a month-to-month basis, while another small bank commenter stated that the Bureau's comment permitting advancing on a month-to-month basis would increase its servicing costs because it would be paying a borrower's insurance twelve times per year.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>With respect to potential impact on borrowers, several commenters suggested that the proposal would result in an increase in incidents of a borrower being double-billed for hazard insurance. These commenters incorrectly interpreted the proposal to require a servicer to pay to maintain coverage even though the borrower had decided to cancel the insurance and pay a new insurer directly. These commenters stated that borrowers may be harmed because borrowers would be responsible for duplicative hazard insurance costs, whereas a borrower would be entitled to a refund for overlapping force-placed insurance, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>With respect to impacts on the insurance market, a number of commenters who are not insurance providers asserted that insurance providers generally view seriously delinquent borrowers as higher insurance risks compared to other borrowers. These commenters expressed concern that the Bureau's proposal could potentially mask this risk because the servicer would be required to advance premiums, even if a borrower is seriously delinquent. One commenter requested that the Bureau state that servicers may inform an insurance provider that a borrower is delinquent. In that regard, a commenter urged the Bureau to provide a form that servicers may provide to insurance providers stating that a lender is paying some identified portion of a borrower's insurance premium due to a deficiency in the borrower's escrow account.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Small banks and credit unions, as well as their trade associations and other small non-bank servicers, indicated that the impact of proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) would be particularly acute for small servicers. These commenters indicated that small servicers typically have different practices with regard to force-placed insurance than large servicers. Outreach with small servicers indicated that in certain circumstances, such servicers may not require borrowers to maintain insurance coverage, may self-insure, or may impose charges for collateral protection plans that may be less costly than advances to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance coverage. Further, commenters asserted that small servicers may be more significantly impacted by the cost of the funds required to be advanced to borrower escrow accounts.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Certain commenters requested clarification regarding whether a servicer would be entitled to recoup any required advances and whether a servicer may be liable to a borrower for failing to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. Further, commenters requested clarification that advancing funds is only required if the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan requires the borrower to maintain hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Finally, one credit union commenter requested that the Bureau exempt servicers of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) from the proposed requirement in § 1024.17(k)(5) to advance funds. The commenter asserted that HELOCs are largely in the subordinate-lien position and requiring a servicer of HELOCs to advance would generally be needless costly to such servicers because servicers servicing liens in the first position would also be advancing payment.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received numerous comments from consumers and consumer advocacy groups with respect to proposed § 1024.17(k)(5). These commenters strongly supported all aspects of proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) as set forth in the proposal. These commenters generally stated, however that the Bureau should go farther than the proposal and implement requirements regarding advances and disbursements to maintain hazard insurance for delinquent borrowers that do not have escrow accounts.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Commenters significantly disagreed regarding the merits of requiring advances and disbursements to maintain hazard insurance of borrowerswithout escrow accounts. A number of consumer advocacy group commenters contended that the Bureau should make no distinction between homeowners that have escrow accounts and those that do not. Certain state attorney general commenters suggested instead that the Bureau should require a servicer, prior to force-placing insurance, to ask for a borrower's consent to renew voluntary coverage and to advance funds for the premium if the borrower gives consent to the creation of an escrow account. Industry commenters were nearly uniformly opposed to requiring servicers to advance funds for the hazard insurance premiums of borrowers who have not escrowed for hazard insurance, citing most often the impracticality for servicers to reinstate a lapsed policy without any gap in coverage.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.17(k)(5) as proposed with adjustments to address pertinent issues raised by the comments. Specifically, the Bureau is not requiring that a servicer advance funds to, or disburse funds from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance in all circumstances. Rather, the Bureau had adjusted the requirement in § 1024.17(k)(5)(i) to provide that a servicer may not obtain force-placed insurance unless a servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance is paid in a timely manner. Thus, for example, a servicer of a mortgage loan, including a HELOC, is not required to disburse funds from an escrow account to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance, so long as the servicer does not purchase force-placed insurance.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to § 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(A), a servicer is unable to disburse funds if the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Further, § 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(B) states that a servicer is not considered unable to disburse funds solely because an escrow account contains insufficient funds. Section 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(C) makes clear that a servicer may seek repayment from a borrower for funds advanced to pay hazard insurance premiums. Finally, the Bureau has determined to exempt small servicers, that is, servicers that service less than 5,000 mortgage loans and only service mortgage loans owned or originated by the servicer or an affiliate so long as any force-placed insurance purchased by the small servicer is less costly to a borrower than the amount that would be required to be disbursed to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage.See§ 1024.17(k)(5)(iii). The Bureau is not implementing any requirement that a servicer advance funds to pay for a hazard insurance policy for a borrower that does not have an escrow account.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a servicer should not obtain force-placed insurance when a servicer is able to make disbursements from an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. As set forth above, unless a policy has been cancelled for reasons other than nonpayment, a borrower's delinquency should not cause a servicer to take actions (or make omissions) that would lead to the cancellation of the borrower's voluntary insurance policy and the potential replacement of that policy with a more expensive (and less protective) force-placed insurance policy. The Bureau acknowledges that in certain circumstances, force-placed insurance is necessary. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not prevent a servicer from obtaining force-placed insurance, subject to the requirements in § 1024.37, when such a policy is appropriate, including, for instance, where a borrower's hazard insurance policy has been cancelled for reasons other than non-payment. In that situation, a servicer may impose a charge on a borrower for a force-placed insurance policy consistent with the requirements in § 1024.37. However, as set forth above and in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe imposition of a charge for force-placed insurance is appropriate where a hazard insurance policy has not been cancelled and a servicer is able to disburse funds from an escrow account to maintain the borrower's preferred hazard insurance policy in force.<footnote ref="63">


              Notably, the National Mortgage Settlement includes a similar protection for borrowers.See e.g., National Mortgage Settlement: Consent AgreementA-37 (2012),available at http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com. (stating that “For escrowed accounts, servicer shall continue to advance payments for the homeowner's existing policy, unless the borrower or insurance company cancels the existing policy.”).

          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is therefore adopting § 1024.17(k)(5) in reliance on section 6(k)(1)(E) of RESPA, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations that are appropriate to carry out the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. The Bureau has additional authority pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of RESPA to establish any requirements necessary to carry out section 6 of REPSA, including section 6(g) with respect to administration of escrow accounts, and has authority pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA to prescribe such rules and regulations, and to make such interpretations, as may be necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. The Bureau also has authority to establish consumer protection regulations pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act. A consumer protection purpose of RESPA is to help borrowers avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, and further, the amendments to section 6(k) of RESPA in section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act evince Congress's intent to establish reasonable protections for borrowers to avoid unwarranted force-placed insurance coverage. Section 1024.17(k)(5) furthers these purposes and is therefore an appropriate regulation under section 6(j) and 6(k)(1)(E) and section 19(a) of RESPA.<footnote ref="64">

              The Bureau notes that regulations established pursuant to section 6 of RESPA are subject to section 6(f) of RESPA, which provides borrowers a private right of action to enforce such regulations.
            </footnote>

          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that § 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse consequences on servicers, borrowers, or the insurance market. With respect to impacts on servicers, § 1024.17(k)(5) does not create significant disincentives to maintain escrow accounts for borrowers. Escrow accounts encourage borrowers to budget for costs of homeownership and to provide funds regularly to servicers to be used to pay those costs, including for insurance, taxes, and other obligations. Lenders include escrow requirements in mortgage contracts because the use of such an account reduces risk to an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Servicer also generally benefit from an escrow account both as a result of the improved performance of mortgage loans and also because of the opportunity to earn a return on funds held. Further, servicers manage the impact of an obligation to make advances to escrow accounts by ensuring that advances may be recouped from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan in the event a property is foreclosed upon and liquidated. In the absence of § 1024.17(k)(5), a servicer that obtains force-placed insurance might advance a greater amount of funds for the force-placed insurance policy and would seek to obtain repayment of those funds either from a borrower or ultimately from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan if a property is foreclosed upon and liquidated. For these reasons, the Bureau is not persuaded that § 1024.17(k)(5) creates an incentive that would materially affect whether servicers offer escrow accounts to borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>With respect to the ability of servicers to use funds in an escrow account topay obligations other than hazard insurance, the Bureau recognizes, of course, that escrow account funds are fungible and that payment of hazard insurance necessarily requires expending funds that would have been available for payment of other escrowed obligations, including tax obligations. Servicers, on behalf of owners or assignees of mortgage loans, currently manage this risk by advancing funds to escrow accounts to pay such obligations and seeking repayment from borrowers or ultimately from proceeds payable to the owners or assignees of mortgage loans. No contrary practice is required here. Further, such a practice does not create any new or enhanced risk for servicers. Further, the Bureau has clarified in § 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(C) that servicers may seek repayment of advances unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. Servicers, as well as owners and assignees of mortgage loans, are capable of managing risks arising from other escrow account obligations by advancing funds to pay any such obligations as appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that § 1024.17(k)(5) presents a material risk to servicers from borrowers cancelling policies, receiving refunds, and, thus, becoming unjustly enriched at the expense of a servicer. A borrower that is current on a mortgage loan obligation but anticipates a future delinquency could engage in the same type of behavior during a period of an escrow account deficiency. Commenters have not demonstrated that such actions typically occur. Further, the Bureau has mitigated this risk by finalizing comment 17(k)(5)(ii)(C)-1, which provides that servicers may, but are not required to, advance payment on a month-to-month basis. Because such advancement is not required on a month-to-month basis, servicers may determine not to undertake that schedule for advances if it would impose greater costs on servicers with respect to maintaining a borrower's hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded that requiring servicers to disburse funds for hazard insurance for borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue will create incentives for borrowers not to make mortgage loan payments or to fund escrow accounts. Nothing in § 1024.17(k)(5), nor Regulation X generally, prevents servicers from charging borrowers late fees or reporting borrower failures to pay to a consumer reporting agency. These consequences to borrowers provide appropriate disincentives from obtaining the far more limited benefit of non-cancellation of a hazard insurance policy.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded, however, by the comment that hazard insurance coverage may not provide similar protections as force-placed insurance. Many hazard insurance policies contain exclusions from coverage for properties that are vacant. In these circumstances, losses may not be covered by insurance for vacant properties. Delinquent borrowers may have a higher incidence of abandoning properties as vacant. Accordingly, the Bureau has adjusted § 1024.17(k)(5)(ii) to provide that a servicer may be considered unable to disburse funds from escrow to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance policy if the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe the borrower's property is vacant.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that § 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse impacts on borrowers. The only borrower harm asserted by servicers and their trade associations is that the requirement will lead to an increase in double-billing when a borrower cancels hazard insurance and obtains a new policy for which the borrower pays the insurer directly. The commenters provide no reason to believe that borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue are more likely to cancel hazard insurance and pay insurance directly than borrowers that are current on a mortgage loan obligation or less than 30 days overdue. Further, if a servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower has cancelled a hazard insurance policy, a servicer is not required to disburse funds to pay for the hazard insurance policy. Finally, when a borrower has cancelled a policy, an insurance company is unlikely to credit the amounts paid by a servicer toward that policy after the date of cancellation.<footnote ref="65">

              Notably, as discussed further below, the risk of double-billing when a servicer is paying toward a policy that was currently in place is markedly different than the risk presented by a requirement that a servicer obtain or renew a previously cancelled policy, which would exist if a servicer were required to disburse funds to obtain a policy for a borrower that does not have an escrow account.
            </footnote>

          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau does not believe that § 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse impacts on the insurance market. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not, as commenters state, mask any risks presented by a borrower that is more than 30 days overdue on a mortgage loan obligation. Nothing in § 1024.17(k)(5) prevents a servicer from reporting a borrower's payment history to a consumer reporting agency, and an insurance provider could, to the extent permitted by applicable law, obtaining borrower information it deems relevant to underwriting insurance, including a consumer report. In addition, if insurers are harmed by insuring borrowers who are delinquent on their mortgage loans, they face that same harm already for borrowers that do not have escrow accounts and pay hazard insurance premiums directly to their insurers. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not present a different category of risk in that regard. With respect to one commenter's request that the Bureau issue a form for lenders and servicers to provide to insurance providers stating that a servicer is paying some identified portion of a borrower's insurance premium due to a deficiency in the borrower's escrow account, the Bureau declines. To the extent applicable law permits a lender or servicer to communicate such information to an insurance provider, the lender or servicer should not need the Bureau to develop a form for the communication.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that special treatment is warranted with respect to “small servicers” as defined in § 1026.41(e)(4). As explained in the section by section discussion of § 1024.30(b) and in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau has identified a class of servicers, referred to as “small servicers” and defined by the combination of the number of loans they service and the servicer's relationship to those loans that sets those servicers apart. With respect to the requirements set forth in § 1024.17(k)(5), outreach with small servicers indicates that small servicers' practices with respect to obtaining force-placed insurance tend to be less costly to borrowers than those utilized by larger servicers. For example, the Bureau understands that small servicers often obtain force-placed insurance in the form of collateral protection policies. The charges passed through to borrowers for such coverage, if any, may be less expensive than the costs of either maintaining a borrower's hazard insurance coverage or purchasing an individual force-placed insurance policy. At the same time, requiring such servicers to continue the borrower's hazard insurance in force, which may require advancing funds to the borrower's escrow, could cause these servicers to incur incremental expenses which, because of their size, would be burdensome for them. Because of this difference in practices, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to reduce the restrictions applicable to small servicers with respect to borrowers that have escrow accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau has exempted small servicers from the restriction in § 1024.17(k)(5)(i) and1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(B), so long any force-placed insurance that is purchased by the small servicer is less costly to a borrower than the amount that would be required to be disbursed to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage. The Bureau believes this partial exemption sets an appropriate balance of effectuating consumer protections for borrowers with escrow accounts and considerations that may be unique to small servicers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments received, the Bureau has also determined not to require servicers to continue hazard insurance policies and advance premium payments for borrowers who have not escrowed for hazard insurance. The Bureau understands the concern of the consumer groups that commented, but the Bureau is persuaded that it would generally be impracticable for servicers to renew the hazard insurance coverage obtained by a non-escrowed borrower without creating a significant risk of double-billing and/or a gap in coverage. For example, although the Bureau does not find concerns about double-billing of borrowers persuasive with respect to situations in which insurance coverage is being paid via disbursement from an escrow account, the Bureau is concerned that a substantially different situation results where the borrower is making direct payments and a policy is allowed to lapse due to non-payment. In those cases, it is far more likely that a consumer may have switched insurance providers without notifying the servicer, and requiring a servicer to obtain a new policy (or to reinstate a previously cancelled policy) may result in borrower harm through the purchase of duplicative insurance and double-billing of a borrower. Further, when a borrower does not have an escrow account, the servicer may not have notice before a policy lapses, and no ability to maintain the policy in continuous force. Were the Bureau to impose a duty on the servicer to pay for hazard insurance in such circumstance, such a duty would not necessarily be to maintain a current policy in force. Rather, the duty could well be to reinstate a lapsed policy or to obtain a new policy on behalf of the borrower to replace the cancelled policy. Requiring a servicer to obtain a new insurance policy on behalf of a borrower that did not have an escrow account to pay for hazard insurance may be burdensome and complex, and may not be justified. Accordingly, the Bureau declines at this time to impose requirements to obtain insurance for borrowers that do not have escrow accounts but will continue to monitor the impact of the requirements set forth in § 1024.37 with respect to force-placed insurance for any such borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Two consumer groups submitted joint comments urging the Bureau to amend current § 1024.17(k)(1) so that a servicer would be required to make timely disbursements with respect to any escrowed charge, not just hazard insurance, so long as the borrower's escrow account contained sufficient funds to do so. These consumer groups asserted that there is no reason to maintain the limitation for disbursements to borrowers that are less than 30 days overdue with respect to escrow obligations other than hazard insurance. For example, the commenters stated that the failure of a servicer to pay tax obligations in a timely manner would harm a borrower, and suggested that finalizing § 1024.17(k)(5) in isolation could cause borrower confusion because borrowers may not understand that the rule applies only to hazard insurance.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands the commenters' concern with respect to the impact on borrowers if an escrowed charge is not paid, but declines to amend § 1024.17(k)(1) as part of this rulemaking. Section 1024.17(k)(5), as adopted, is only a restriction on servicers' ability to obtain force-placed insurance. If a servicer will not be purchasing force-placed insurance, the servicer is not subject to the provisions of § 1024.17(k)(5). For example, a servicer that does not require a borrower to maintain insurance is not required to disburse funds to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage other than as required pursuant to § 1024.17(k)(1). Because the Bureau is not imposing a blanket obligation to advance funds to escrow to pay hazard insurance premiums, the Bureau does not believe that it would be appropriate to impose such an obligation with respect to other payments to be made from escrow. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to amend § 1024.17(k)(1) as suggested.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Finally, as discussed above, the Bureau requested comments on an alternative approach to § 1024.17(k)(5), which would have added language to § 1024.37 to provide that if a borrower has an escrow account established for hazard insurance, a servicer could not charge the borrower for force-placed insurance unless the force-placed insurance obtained by a servicer was less expensive to the borrower, for comparable coverage, than would be the servicer's advancing funds to continue the borrower's hazard insurance policy. The Bureau further requested comments on whether § 1024.37 should additionally require that force-placed insurance purchased by a servicer under these circumstances protect a borrower's interests.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>One large force-placed insurance provider asserted that the proposed alternative is neither necessary or realistic because proposed § 1024.17(k)(5) reflects general industry practice and because the cost of force-placed insurance is invariably more expensive to the borrower than the servicer advancing funds to continue a borrower's hazard insurance policy. On the other hand, another large force-placed insurance provider and a national trade association expressed a preference for the alternative compared to proposed § 1024.17(k)(5). These commenters preferred, however, that the alternative be placed in § 1024.17(k), and not in § 1024.37, because they believed that this alternative should only limit a servicer's force-placement of insurance in situations where an escrowed borrower's hazard insurance was canceled due to a servicer's failure to disburse funds to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance. Commenters further expressed a variety of views concerning how the scope of comparable coverage would be determined. While industry commenters acknowledged that the industry standard is to obtain force-placed coverage equal to the replacement cost of the property, two national trade associations and a large force-placed insurance provider argued that servicers must be given flexibility to determine coverage levels. In contrast, another large force-placed insurance provider suggested that the Bureau should require coverage at replacement cost value.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments received on the alternative, the Bureau believes that the alternative proposal's requirement regarding comparable coverage would add unnecessary complexity to the regulation. Whether a borrower may or may not benefit from any particular coverage level is dependent on the individual circumstances of the borrower. Further, differences between coverage provided for homeowners' insurance and force-placed insurance make a comparability determination and complex and difficult process. The Bureau declines to adopt the alternative proposal with respect to obtaining comparable coverage.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.17(k)(5), as adopted, however, is informed by the alternative and the comments received in response to the alternative. The Bureau has adjusted the requirement in§ 1024.17(k)(5), consistent with the alternative, to reflect that a servicer's ability to disburse funds to maintain hazard insurance coverage serves as a restriction on the servicer's purchasing force-placed insurance coverage. Thus, a servicer is not required in all instances to disburse funds to maintain hazard insurance coverage for borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue; instead, a servicer may not obtain force-placed insurance coverage unless the servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account pursuant to § 1024.17(k)(5). Further, the exemption for small servicers in § 1024.17(k)(5)(iii) provides that a small servicer may obtain force-placed insurance, even if the small servicer is not unable to disburse funds from a borrower's escrow account, so long as the cost to the borrower is less than the amount the small servicer would need to disburse to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance, without consideration of the specific policy coverage provisions.</analysisParagraph>

In addition to these specific comments, the Bureau is adopting five comments of general applicability to the Bureau's official interpretations of Regulation X. Comment I-1 provides that the official Bureau interpretations in supplement I to part 1024 is the primary vehicle by which the Bureau issues official interpretations of Regulation X, and that good faith compliance with the official Bureau interpretations affords protection from liability under section 19(b) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment I-2 provides that request for an official interpretation shall be in writing and addressed to the Associate Director, Research, Markets, and Regulations, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. The requests shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts concerning the issue, including copies of all pertinent documents. Except in unusual circumstances, such official interpretations will not be issued separately but will be incorporated in the official commentary to this part, which will be amended periodically. No official interpretations will be issued approving financial institutions' forms or statements. This restriction does not apply to forms or statements whose use is required or sanctioned by a government agency.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment I-3 provides that unofficial oral interpretations may be provided at the discretion of Bureau staff. Written requests for such interpretations should be sent to the address set forth for official interpretations. Unofficial oral interpretations provide no protection under section 19(b) of RESPA. Ordinarily, staff will not issue unofficial oral interpretations on matters adequately covered by this part or the official Bureau interpretations. The Bureau proposed I-1 through I-3 in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal. Having received no comments on proposed I-1 through I-3, the Bureau adopts I-1 through I-3 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment I-4 to provide instructions on rules of construction applicable to the comments set forth in Supplement I to Part 1024—Official Bureau Interpretations. Comment I-4 provides that: (1) lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including, but not limited to,” “among other things,” “for example,” or “such as”; and (2) throughout the commentary, reference to “this section” or “this paragraph” means the section or paragraph in the regulation that is the subject of the comment. The Bureau is also adopting comment I-5 to explain that each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that the comment interprets and that the comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. Although the Bureau did not propose comments I-4 and I-5, the Bureau believes that adopting these comments in the final rule promotes the proper use of commentary the Bureau has set forth in Supplement I to part 1024.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1024.5 Coverage of RESPA</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to redesignate § 1024.13 as § 1024.5(c). Section 1024.13, “Relation to State laws,” sets forth rules regarding the relationship of the requirements in RESPA and Regulation X to requirements established pursuant to State law. In the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau divided Regulation X into subparts and § 1024.13 was located in new “Subpart B—Mortgage Settlement and Escrow Accounts.” However, the provisions of § 1024.13(a) are intended to apply with respect to all of Regulation X. Because § 1024.13 applies for all sections of Regulation X, the Bureau proposed to redesignate § 1024.13 as § 1024.5(c), located within “Subpart A—General Provisions.” Further, the Bureau proposed to remove and reserve § 1024.13.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further proposed to add commentary for proposed § 1024.5(c) to make clear that Regulation X does not create field preemption. Since issuing the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau had received inquiries as to whether Regulation X's mortgage servicing rules result in preemption of the field of mortgage servicing regulation. The Bureau had addressed this question in the preamble to the final rule, stating that “the Final Servicing Rules generally do not have the effect of prohibiting State law from affording borrowers broader consumer protection relating to mortgage servicing than those conferred under the Final Servicing Rules.”<footnote ref="16">78 FR 10706 (Feb. 14, 2013).</footnote>
          The preamble further stated that, although “in certain circumstances, the effect of specific requirements of the Final Servicing Rules is to preempt certain limited aspects of state law” in general, “the Bureau explicitly took into account existing standards (both State and Federal) and either built in flexibility or designed its rules to coexist with those standards.”<footnote ref="17">Id. (specifically identifying the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights).</footnote></analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau continued to receive questions on this issue, the Bureau believed it was appropriate to propose commentary to clarify the scope of proposed § 1024.5(c) and expressly address concerns about field preemption. Consistent with the preamble to the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, proposed comment 5(c)(1)-1 stated that State laws that are in conflict with the requirements of RESPA or Regulation X may be preempted by RESPA and Regulation X. Proposed comment 5(c)(1)-1 stated further that nothing in RESPA or Regulation X, including the provisions in subpart C with respect to mortgage servicers or mortgage servicing, should be construed to preempt the entire field of regulation of the covered practices. This proposed addition to the commentary was meant to clarify that RESPA and Regulation X do not effectuate field preemption of States' regulation of mortgage servicers or mortgage servicing. The comment also made clear that RESPA and Regulation X do not preempt State laws that give greater protection to consumers than do these federal laws.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment regarding the addition of the proposed commentary, including whether further clarification regarding the preemption effects of RESPA and Regulation X was necessary or appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Numerous consumer and community groups provided similar comments supporting the proposed changes to the Regulation X preemption provision. These commenters supported the relocation of the preemption provision to § 1024.5(c) in the General Provisions subpart and the addition of comment 5(c)(1)-1. Many of these consumer and community groups further suggested that the regulatory text itself be changed to replace the phrase “settlement practices” with language more clearly inclusive of servicing activities. Several also requested that an example be included with comment 5(c)(1)-1 showing that a state law more protective of consumers will not be preempted by Regulation X.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry commenters supported the proposed changes to the Regulation X preemption provision. One trade association suggested that the Bureau should promote uniform servicing standards to help create certainty in the market. Another industry commenter stated that the current regulation covered the situation sufficiently and the proposed guidance was unnecessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two trade associations stated that the Bureau was narrowing the existing preemption provision to reduce the likelihood of preemption. One opposed the idea that state laws more protective of consumers are not preempted, and so opposed the inclusion of the comment. The other stated that the preemption provision for mortgage servicing transfers functions statutorily as a general preemption of mortgage servicing.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters pointed out that the statute and regulation use the word “inconsistent” when explaining which state laws may be preempted, while the proposed comment uses the more common term “conflict” to describe the situation. They suggested that the comment also use the term “inconsistent” to avoid confusion.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The relocation of the preemption provision and the guidance in proposed comment 5(c)(1)-1 were not intended to change the current preemption regime under Regulation X and the Bureau does not believe that they do so. The sentence in the regulation that consumer and community groups urged the Bureau to change simply replicates text in RESPA section 18. Therefore the Bureau does not believe that a change to that sentence would be appropriate. Comment 5(c)(1)-1 provides the Bureau's official interpretation of that regulatory language. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the relocation of the preemption provision and the addition of the comment are necessary and appropriate to eliminate any confusion as to how the preemption provision operates. In addition, the Bureau believes that the comment is sufficiently clear and does not consider an example to be necessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts the amendments as proposed, but changes the word “conflict” in the comment to “inconsistent” to avoid confusion.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>35(c) and 36(b) Contact Information for Borrowers To Assert Errors and Information Requests</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend the commentary to § 1024.35(c) and § 1024.36(b) with respect to disclosure of the exclusive address (a servicer may designate an exclusive address for the receipt of notifications of errors and requests for information) when a servicer discloses contact information to the borrower for the purpose of assistance from the servicer. Section 1024.35(c), as adopted by the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, state that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit a notice of error to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.35. Comment 35(c)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer. Similarly, § 1024.36(b) states that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit information requests to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.36. Comment 36(b)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that comments 35(c)-2 and 36(b)-2 could be interpreted more broadly than the Bureau had intended. Section 1024.35(c) and comment 35(c)-2, as well as § 1024.36(b) and comment 36(b)-2, are intended to ensure that servicers inform borrowers of the correct address for the borrower to use for purposes of submitting notices of error or information requests, so that borrowers do not inadvertently send these communications to other non-designated servicer addresses (which would not provide the protections afforded by §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36, respectively). If interpreted literally, the existing comments would require the servicer to include the designated address for notices of error and requests for information when <em data-original="E-03">any</em> contact information, even just a phone number or web address, for the servicer is given to the borrower. The Bureau did not intend that the servicer be required to inform the borrower of the designated address in all communications with borrowers where any contact information whatsoever for the servicer is provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 35(c)-2 to provide that, if a servicer establishes a designated error resolution address, the servicer must provide that address to a borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with an <em data-original="E-03">address</em> for assistance from the servicer. Similarly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 36(b)-2 to provide that, if a servicer establishes a designated information request address, the servicer must provide that address to a borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with an <em data-original="E-03">address</em> for assistance from the servicer.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry as well as consumer groups addressing these proposed clarifications. Industry commenters supported limiting the locations where the designated address is required, but asserted that the requirement was still overbroad and unclear as to when the designated address must be provided. These commenters expressed concern that they would have to provide the designated address on every letter that included a return address or an address in the letterhead. The commenters also stated this would be unduly burdensome as it would require significant programming costs. Commenters further stated this would create problems for borrowers by causing cluttered, confusing documents leading borrowers to incorrectly send other things to the designated address (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a borrower may send a payment to the designated address, leading to a delay in payment processing). Finally, commenters stated the proposed clarification could create conflicts with other regulations, such as the force-placed insurance letters, which include an address but do not allow additional information to be included. Industry commenters generally suggested the designated address be required only in a specific subset of contexts: the initial designation letter, the periodic statements and coupon book, the servicer's Web site, and loss mitigation documents.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters expressed concern that borrowers will not be informed of their rights. Such commenters objected to a decision the Bureau made, in the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, to eliminate the requirement that a servicer receiving a transferred loan include information on the error resolution procedures in its notice to the borrower about the transfer. Such commenters suggested that information on the error resolution and information request rights should be included on each periodic statement.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting revised versions of proposed comments 35(c)-2 and 36(b)-2. The Bureau notes that the proposal only addressed when the designated address must be provided, and that comments about providing borrowers information about the general procedures to submit error notifications or information requests are beyond the scope of the proposed changes to the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded that the proposed language of “an address for assistance” might not have fully addressed the concerns of the provision being overbroad, as the proposed language could have been interpreted to require the designated address on every document from the servicer that contains a return address. The Bureau is further persuaded by the concern that borrowers could have been confused and incorrectly sent items that did not concern error resolution to the designated address. To require the designated address on every piece of written communication that includes a return address would be unduly burdensome and not in the best interests of the borrower. Thus, under the final rule, the designated address need be included in only a specific subset of contexts, specifically (1) the written notice, required by § 1024.35(c) and § 1024.36(b) if a servicer designates an exclusive address; (2) any periodic statement or coupon book required pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41; (3) any Web site maintained by the servicer in connection with the servicing of the loan; and (4) any notice required pursuant to §§ 1024.39 or 1026.41 that includes contact information for assistance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While servicers will not specifically be required to provide the designated address in contexts other than those described in the amended comments, the Bureau notes that a servicer remains subject to the requirement in § 1026.38(b)(5) to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer informs the borrower of the procedures for submitting written notices of error and information requests. Further, as discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of section 38(b)(5), the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3 clarifying a servicer's obligation to ensure borrowers are informed of the designated address. The Bureau believes this the final rule will best balance practical considerations with the need to notify borrowers of the designated address.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>38(b)(5) Informing Borrowers of the Written Error Resolution and Information Request</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Procedures</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the section-by-section discussion of §§ 1024.35(c) and 1024.36(b), the Bureau is amending comments 35(c)-2 and 36(b)-2 to clarify in what contexts the designated address for notices of error or requests for information must be provided. The finalized comments clarify that, if a servicer designates such an address, that address must be provided in any notice required pursuant to §§ 1024.39 or 1024.41 that includes contact information for assistance. The Bureau notes that servicers may provide borrowers in delinquency with different addresses for different purposes. For example, a servicer may provide a borrower with the designated address for asserting errors, and a separate address for submission of loss mitigation applications. To mitigate the risk of a borrower sending a notification of error to the wrong address (and thus not triggering the associated protections), the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.35 sets out certain procedures a servicer must follow when a borrower submits a written notice of error. These procedures provide important protections to borrowers who in are in delinquency (as well as at other times). Specifically, the procedures in § 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) require a servicer to take certain actions before a scheduled foreclosure sale if a borrower asserts certain errors.<footnote ref="22">Section 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) requires that, if a borrower asserts an error related to a servicer making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process in violation of § 1024.41(f) or (j), or related to a servicer moving for foreclosure judgment or order of sale or conducting a foreclosure sale in violation of § 1024.41(g) or (j), the servicer must comply with the requirements of the error resolution procedures prior to the date of a foreclosure sale, or within 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error, whichever is earlier.</footnote> These protections are only triggered if a borrower submits a written notice of error to the designated address (assuming the servicer has designated such an address). Thus, the Bureau believes it is important that borrowers asserting errors send the notice of error to the proper address.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that existing provisions do address ensuring the borrower is aware of the procedures required to trigger the error resolution protections. Section 1024.38(b)(5) requires a servicer to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers of the written error resolution and information request procedures. The Bureau acknowledges that a borrower in delinquency who is working with a continuity of contact representative and submitting documents related to loss mitigation may be confused about where to submit notices asserting errors. If such a borrower were to orally report the assertion of the error to the continuity of contact representative, comment 38(b)(5)-2 explains that § 1024.38(b)(s) would require servicers to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to notify a borrower who is not satisfied with the resolution of the complaint of the procedures for submitting a written notice of error. However, the Bureau is concerned that, if borrowers were to submit written assertions of an error to the addresses where they were submitting loss mitigation documents, such borrowers may believe they have properly followed the procedures, but in fact would not have triggered the protections under § 1024.35.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address this concern, in connection with the clarification above on the contexts in which the designated address must be provided, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3. The new comment clarifies a servicer's obligation pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(5) by stating that a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that if a borrower submits a notice of error to an incorrect address that was given to the borrower in connection with submission of a loss mitigation application or the continuity of contact pursuant to § 1024.40, the servicer will ensure the borrower is informed of the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in § 1024.35, including the correct address. Alternatively, the servicer could redirect notices of error that were sent to an incorrect address to the designated address established pursuant to § 1024.35(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend the commentary to § 1024.35(c) and § 1024.36(b) with respect to disclosure of the exclusive address (a servicer may designate an exclusive address for the receipt of notifications of errors and requests for information) when a servicer discloses contact information to the borrower for the purpose of assistance from the servicer. Section 1024.35(c), as adopted by the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, state that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit a notice of error to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.35. Comment 35(c)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer. Similarly, § 1024.36(b) states that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit information requests to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.36. Comment 36(b)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that comments 35(c)-2 and 36(b)-2 could be interpreted more broadly than the Bureau had intended. Section 1024.35(c) and comment 35(c)-2, as well as § 1024.36(b) and comment 36(b)-2, are intended to ensure that servicers inform borrowers of the correct address for the borrower to use for purposes of submitting notices of error or information requests, so that borrowers do not inadvertently send these communications to other non-designated servicer addresses (which would not provide the protections afforded by §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36, respectively). If interpreted literally, the existing comments would require the servicer to include the designated address for notices of error and requests for information when <em data-original="E-03">any</em> contact information, even just a phone number or web address, for the servicer is given to the borrower. The Bureau did not intend that the servicer be required to inform the borrower of the designated address in all communications with borrowers where any contact information whatsoever for the servicer is provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 35(c)-2 to provide that, if a servicer establishes a designated error resolution address, the servicer must provide that address to a borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with an <em data-original="E-03">address</em> for assistance from the servicer.

Section 1024.35(g)(1)(iii)(B) provides that a notice of error is untimely if it is delivered to the servicer more than one year after a mortgage loan balance was paid in full.

        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to replace the references to “the date a mortgage loan balance is paid in full” with “the date the mortgage loan is discharged.” The proposal noted that this change would address circumstances in which a loan is terminated without being paid in full, such as a loan that was discharged through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure without full satisfaction of the underlying contractual obligation. Further, the proposal stated that this change also would align more closely with § 1024.38(c)(1), which requires a servicer to retain records that document actions taken with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account only until one year after the date a mortgage loan is “discharged.”</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau believes the requirement to resolve errors and respond to information requests should last over the same timeframe as the obligation to retain records. The Bureau believes it would be impractical to require a servicer to resolve errors and provide information at a time when Regulation X no longer requires the servicer to retain the relevant records. Conversely, the Bureau believes the servicer should be responsible to correct those records during the period when Regulation X does require a servicer to retain records, if necessary, and provide borrowers information from the records. Further, the Bureau believes the use of the term “discharged” is appropriate, especially given that the term is already used in the timing of the record-retention requirement. For purposes of the Bureau's mortgage servicing rules, as opposed to bankruptcy purposes, a mortgage loan is discharged when both the debt and all corresponding liens have been extinguished or released, as applicable. The Bureau believes a borrower should have the benefit of the error resolution, information request, and record retention provisions so long as a debt <em data-original="E-03">or</em> lien remains because only after both have been eliminated will there be no further possibility of a borrower needing to seek servicing information or to assert a servicing error.

      <title>41(b)(2)(i) Requirements</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend the commentary to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i) to clarify servicers' obligations with respect to providing notices to borrowers regarding the review of loss mitigation applications. Section 1024.41(b)(2)(i) requires a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale to review and evaluate the application promptly and determine, based on that review, whether the application is complete or incomplete.<footnote ref="23">A “complete loss mitigation application” is defined in § 1024.41(b)(1) as “an application in connection with which a servicer has received all the information the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower.”</footnote> The servicer then must notify the borrower within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays) that the servicer acknowledges receipt of the application, and that the servicer has determined that the loss mitigation application is either complete or incomplete. If an application is incomplete, the notice must state the additional documents and information that the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete. In addition, servicers are obligated under § 1024.41(b)(1) to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete an incomplete application, which may require, when appropriate, the servicer to contact the borrower and request such information as illustrated in comment 41(b)(1)-4.i.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Following publication of the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from industry stakeholders requesting guidance or clarification regarding how this provision may apply in instances where a servicer determines that additional information from the borrower is needed to complete an evaluation of a loss mitigation application after either (1) the servicer has provided notice to the borrower informing the borrower that the loss mitigation application is complete, or (2) the servicer has provided notice to the borrower identifying other specific information or documentation necessary to complete the application and the borrower has furnished that documentation or information. As these stakeholders noted, servicers sometimes must collect additional information from borrowers, the need for which may not have been apparent at the point of initial application, in order to process the application and satisfy the applicable investor requirements. In these situations, a borrower may have submitted the documents and information identified in the initial notice, resulting in an application that is facially complete based on the servicer's initial review, but the servicer, upon further evaluation, determines that additional information is required to evaluate the borrower for a loss mitigation option pursuant to requirements imposed by an investor or guarantor of a mortgage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed additional commentary to address these concerns. As the Bureau explained in the June 2013 Proposal, the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) is intended to provide the borrower with timely notification that a loss mitigation application was received and either is considered complete by the servicer or is considered incomplete and that the borrower is required to take further action for the servicer to evaluate the loss mitigation application. The Bureau was conscious of concerns that servicers have unnecessarily prolonged loss mitigation processes by incomplete and inadequate document reviews that lead to repeated requests for supplemental information that reasonably could have been requested initially, and so the Bureau designed the rule to ensure an adequate up-front review. At the same time, the Bureau did not believe it would be in the best interest of borrowers or servicers to create a system that leads to borrower applications being denied solely because they contain inadequate information and the servicer believes it may not request the additional information needed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau therefore proposed three provisions to address these concerns. First, the Bureau proposed new comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-1, which would have clarified that, notwithstanding that a servicer has informed a borrower that an application is complete (or notified the borrower of specific information necessary to complete an incomplete application), a servicer must request additional information from a borrower if the servicer determines, in the course of evaluating the loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower, that additional information is required.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau proposed new comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2, which would have clarified that, except as provided in § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) (the Bureau's third proposed new provision, discussed below), the protections triggered by a complete loss mitigation application in § 1024.41 would not be triggered by an incomplete application. An application would have been considered complete only when a servicer has received all the information the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower, even if an inaccurate § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice had been sent to the borrower. The Bureau noted that the proposed clarifications would not have allowed servicers deliberately to inform borrowers that incomplete applications are complete or to describe the information necessary to complete an application as something less than all of the necessary information. Servicers are required under § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A) to review a loss mitigation application to determine whether it is complete or incomplete. In addition, servicers are subject to the § 1024.38(b)(2)(iv) requirement to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objectives of identifying documents and information that a borrower is required to submit to complete an otherwise incomplete loss mitigation application, and servicers are obligated under § 1024.41(b)(1) to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete an incomplete application. Thus, the proposed clarifications were intended to address situations where servicers make bona fide mistakes in initially evaluating loss mitigation applications.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, as described more fully below, the Bureau proposed new § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) to require that, if a servicer creates a reasonable expectation that a loss mitigation application is complete, but later discovers information is missing, the servicer must treat the application as complete for certain purposes until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the loss mitigation application. The Bureau believed the proposed rule would mitigate potential risks to consumers that could arise through a loss mitigation process prolonged by incomplete and inadequate document reviews and repeated requests for supplemental information. The Bureau believed these new provisions would provide a mechanism for servicers to correct bona fide mistakes in conducting up-front reviews of loss mitigation applications for completeness, while ensuring that borrowers do not lose the protections under the rule due to such mistakes and that servicers have incentives to conduct rigorous up-front review of loss mitigation applications.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry as well as consumer groups addressing the proposed provisions addressing a facially complete application. Commenters were generally supportive of the Bureau addressing situations where a servicer later discovers additional information is required to evaluate an application that is complete according to the terms of the notice the servicer sent the borrower. Commenters generally agreed that a strict rule that prevents servicers from seeking additional information when needed would result in unnecessary denials of loss mitigation to the borrower and that encouraging communication from the servicer to the borrower will improve loss mitigation procedures for the borrower. However, some commenters expressed the view that the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules were sufficient in this regard and that revisions at a date so close to implementation are counterproductive to institutions trying to implement the rule.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed further below in connection with § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), the Bureau is adopting amendments that achieve largely the same effect as the proposal in addressing situations where a servicer requires additional information to review a facially complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau believes, as it suggested in the proposal, that there is little value in requiring a servicer to evaluate a loss mitigation application when the servicer has determined certain items of information are missing. The Bureau is therefore adopting comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-1, which clarifies that if, a servicer determines, in the course of evaluating the loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower, that additional information is required, the servicer must promptly request the additional information from the borrower. The comment also references § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), a new provision that sets forth requirements and procedures for a servicer to follow in the event that a facially complete application is later found by the servicer to require additional information or documentation to be evaluated. See the discussion of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) in the section-by-section analysis below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2, which would have provided that protections triggered by a “complete” loss mitigation application would not be triggered by a facially complete application— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> where the servicer informs the borrower that the application is complete, or the borrower provides all the documents and information specified by the servicer in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice as needed to render the application complete. The Bureau continues to believe that certain protections must be provided to borrowers who have submitted all the missing documents and information requested in the 1026.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, even if a servicer later determines additional information is necessary. However, the Bureau has been persuaded by commenters that argued a borrower who submits all the documents requested in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice (if any) should receive the protection the rule affords to borrowers at the time the borrower submits those documents. In accordance with this approach, proposed comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2 has not been finalized.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(b)(2)(ii) Time Period Disclosure</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend the § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) time period disclosure requirement, which requires a servicer to provide a date by which a borrower should submit any missing documents and information necessary to make a loss mitigation application complete. Section 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) requires a servicer to provide in the notice required pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) the earliest remaining of four specific dates set forth in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii). The four dates set forth in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) are: (1) The date by which any document or information submitted by a borrower will be considered stale or invalid pursuant to any requirements applicable to any loss mitigation option available to the borrower; (2) the date that is the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency; (3) the date that is 90 days before a foreclosure sale; and (4) the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In general, many of the protections afforded to a borrower by § 1024.41 are dependent on a borrower submitting a complete loss mitigation application a certain amount of time before a foreclosure sale. The later a borrower submits a complete application, and the closer in time to a foreclosure sale, the fewer protections the borrower receives under § 1024.41. It is therefore in the interest of borrowers to complete loss mitigation applications as early in the delinquency and foreclosure process as possible. However, even if a borrower does not complete a loss mitigation application sufficiently early in the process to secure <em data-original="E-03">all</em> the protections possibly available under § 1024.41, that borrower may still benefit from some of the protections afforded. Borrowers should not be discouraged from completing loss mitigation applications merely because they cannot complete a loss mitigation application by the date that would be most advantageous in terms of securing the protections available under § 1024.41. Accordingly, the goal of § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) is to inform borrowers of the time by which they should complete their loss mitigation applications to receive the greatest set of protections available, without discouraging later efforts if the borrower does not complete the loss mitigation application by the suggested date. The Bureau notes § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) requires servicers to inform borrowers of the date by which the borrower <em data-original="E-03">should</em> make the loss mitigation application complete, as opposed to the date by which the borrower <em data-original="E-03">must</em> make the loss mitigation application complete.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed, based on communications with consumer advocates, servicers, and trade associations, that the requirement in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) may be overly prescriptive and may prevent a servicer from having the flexibility to suggest an appropriate date by which a borrower should complete a loss mitigation application. For example, if a borrower submits a loss mitigation application on the 114th day of delinquency, the servicer would have to inform him or her by the 119th day that the borrower should complete the loss mitigation application by the 120th day under the current provision. A borrower is unlikely to be able to assemble the missing information within one day, and would be better served by being advised to complete the loss mitigation application by a reasonable later date that would afford the borrower most of the benefits of the rule as well as enough time to gather the information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to these concerns, and in accordance with the goals of the provision, the Bureau proposed to amend the requirement in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii). Specifically, the Bureau proposed to replace the requirement that a servicer disclose the earliest remaining date of the four specific dates set forth in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) with a more flexible requirement that a servicer determine and disclose a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the documents and information necessary to make the loss mitigation application complete. The Bureau proposed to clarify this amendment in proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1, which would have explained that, in determining a reasonable date, a servicer should select the deadline that preserves the maximum borrower rights under § 1024.41, except when doing so would be impracticable. Proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 would have clarified further that a servicer should consider the four deadlines previously set forth in § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) as factors in selecting a reasonable date. Proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 also would have clarified that if a foreclosure sale is not scheduled, for the purposes of determining a reasonable date, a servicer may make a reasonable estimate of when a foreclosure sale may be scheduled. This proposal was intended to provide appropriate flexibility while also requiring that servicers consider the impact of the various times, and the associated protections, set forth in § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry as well as consumer groups addressing these proposed provisions. Industry commenters appreciated the extra flexibility offered by the proposal, but expressed concern about the complexity of selecting a date. Such commenters noted that different servicers might have different estimates of what should be a reasonable time for otherwise similarly situated borrowers, and differences in state law might also cause two apparently similar borrowers to receive different notices. Additionally, these commenters expressed concern that ambiguity in what is “practical” increases the risk of litigation. These commenters suggested either a simpler rule, under which the application should be complete by the earlier of 30 days after the borrower submitted the incomplete application or the 38th day before a scheduled foreclosure sale (an approach taken by HAMP), or that the Bureau provide additional guidance for determining what is impractical. Finally, commenters expressed concern about borrower confusion, stating that borrowers will not understand the significance of the various dates.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups expressed concern that if servicers have discretion about how to inform borrowers when they should complete their applications, servicers will misguide borrowers and cause them to complete applications too late to receive all the protections that could have been available under the rule. Additionally, some consumer groups expressed the view that this whole issue would be avoided if the loss mitigation protections were triggered by an initial application package, defined as a specific subset of documents required for loss mitigation, rather than a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending the text of § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) to require that the related notice must include a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the missing information. Additionally, the Bureau is adopting an revised version of proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 to clarify what is a reasonable date to include in a notice sent pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B). Similar to the proposal, final comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 states that, in determining a reasonable date, a servicer should select the date that preserves the maximum borrower rights possible under § 1024.41 (and provides the four milestones originally in the regulation text), except when doing so would be impracticable to permit the borrower sufficient time to obtain and submit the type of documentation needed. The final comment has been amended to state further that, generally, it would be impracticable for a borrower to obtain and submit documents in less than seven days.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposed rule, the Bureau has structured this provision so that borrowers receive information that encourages them to submit a complete application in time to receive the most protections possible under the rule, while not discouraging borrowers who miss this time from later submitting an application to receive a subset of the protections. Because some of the protections are triggered by the submission of a complete loss mitigation application when a certain amount of time remains before a scheduled foreclosure sale, the protections decrease the later a borrower submits an application. Thus, the Bureau declines to adopt a rule that simply suggests the borrower complete the application within 30 days because such a rule will not meet the intended purposes of the provision.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also understands that a borrower may not understand the significance of certain milestones, and may be confused if presented by a list of different dates. This is the very reason the rule requires the servicer to provide a single date by which the borrower should complete the application—it removes the burden from the borrower of calculating the different timelines and attempting to determine by when they should complete their application.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does appreciate the challenges of determining what would be impracticable, thus the Bureau has added language to the commentary explaining that generally it would be impracticable for a borrower to obtain and submit documents in less than seven days. The Bureau notes this is a minimum number of days, and that a servicer may extend this timeline if it believes the borrower would need more time to gather the information. The Bureau believes this approach gives servicers guidance as to what is impracticable, while allowing some flexibility for servicers to address situations where additional time would be required for the borrower to submit particular types of missing information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, while the final rule does not permit servicers to estimate foreclosure sale dates in other contexts, such as for purposes of determining whether a borrower will be granted an appeal right when no foreclosure sale has actually been scheduled, the Bureau believes it appropriate to allow servicers to estimate a foreclosure sale date for the narrow purpose of this provision. The Bureau notes that servicers may have information about when a foreclosure sale is likely to be scheduled and that allowing a servicer to use this information in determining the time by which a borrower should complete the application would provide the most useful date for borrowers. Thus, the Bureau includes this provision in the comment adopted by this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that some consumer groups suggested loss mitigation protections should be triggered by an initial application package, defined as a specific subset of documents required for loss mitigation, rather than a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau notes that while such an approach has been used in other loss mitigation programs, such a modification to the loss mitigation provisions of § 1024.41 is beyond the scope of the proposed changes to the rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(c)(1)(ii)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) to state explicitly that the notice this provision requires must state the deadline for accepting or rejecting a servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option, in addition to the requirements currently in § 1024.41(d)(2) to specify, where applicable, that the borrower may appeal the servicer's denial of a loan modification option, the deadline for doing so, and any requirements for making an appeal. As described in the proposal, the Bureau intended that the § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) notice would specify the time and procedures for the borrower to accept or to reject the servicer's offer, in accordance with requirements specified in § 1024.41(e). Indeed, § 1024.41(e)(2)(i) provides that the servicer may deem the borrower to have rejected the offer if the borrower does not respond within the timelines specified under § 1024.41(e)(1). Further, under § 1024.41(e)(2)(ii) and that the servicer must give the borrower a reasonable opportunity to complete documentation necessary to accept an offer of a trial loan modification plan if the borrower does not follow the specified procedures but begins making payments in accordance with the offer by the deadline specified in § 1024.41(e)(1). Commenters did not have any objections to the proposed provision, and the Bureau is adopting this provision as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(d) Denial of Loan Modification Options</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to move the substance of § 1024.41(d)(2), a provision addressing disclosure of information on the borrower's right to appeal, to § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii). As a conforming amendment, the Bureau proposed to re-codify § 1024.41(d)(1) as § 1024.41(d) and to re-designate the corresponding commentary accordingly. The Bureau is finalizing these provisions as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to clarify the requirement in § 1024.41(d)(1), re-codified as § 1024.41(d), that a servicer must disclose the reasons for the denial of any trial or permanent loan modification option available to the borrower. The Bureau believed it was appropriate to clarify that the requirement to disclose the reasons for denial focuses on only those determinations actually made by the servicer and does not require a servicer to continue evaluating additional factors after the servicer has already decided to deny a borrower for a particular loss mitigation option. Thus, when a servicer's automated system uses a program that considers a borrower for a loan modification by proceeding through a series of questions and ends the process if the consumer is denied, the servicer need not modify the system to continue evaluating the borrower under additional criteria. For example, suppose a borrower must meet qualifications A, B, and C to receive a loan modification, but the borrower does not meet any of these qualifications. A servicer's system may start by asking if the borrower meets qualification A, and on the failure of that qualification end the analysis for that specific loan modification option. If a servicer were required to disclose all potential reasons why the borrower may have been denied for that loan modification option (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> A, B, and C), it would need to consider a lengthy series of hypothetical scenarios: for example, if the borrower had met qualification A, would the borrower also have met qualification B? The Bureau did not intend such a requirement, which it believes would be unnecessarily burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau instead intended to require only the disclosure of the actual reason or reasons on which the borrower was evaluated and denied. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend § 1024.41(d) to require that a denial notice provided by the servicer must state the “specific reason or reasons” for the denial and also, where applicable, disclose that the borrower was not evaluated based on other criteria. The notice would not be required to list such criteria. The Bureau believed that this additional information will help borrowers understand the status of their application and the fact that they were not fully evaluated under all factors (where applicable). The Bureau also proposed new comment 41(d)-4 stating that, if a servicer's system reaches the first issue that causes a denial but does not evaluate borrowers for additional factors, a servicer need only provide the reason or reasons actually considered. The Bureau believed this proposed amendment would appropriately balance potential concerns about compliance challenges with concerns about informing borrowers about the status of their applications and about information that is relevant to potential appeals.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from both industry and consumer groups addressing the proposed modifications. Commenters were generally in favor of this revision to the rule, and agreed it would be unduly burdensome for servicers to construct systems to consider hypothetical scenarios solely for the purpose of compiling a complete list of all potential denial reasons. One industry commenter suggested that the denial reasons disclosed be limited to “primary” or “initial” reasons. One consumer group expressed concern that the proposed revision would allow servicers to avoid disclosing the factors used in the net present value analysis.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in the proposal, the Bureau is finalizing the rule as proposed. The Bureau declines to modify the rule to require only the “initial” or “primary” reasons as suggested by some commenters because the Bureau believes these terms are unclear. The Bureau also disagrees with commenters that suggested that the modification to the rule allows a servicer to evade disclosure of a factor used in an NPV analysis. The rule requires servicers to disclose the basis for the denial, so if a servicer denies a borrower for a loan modification option based on an NPV analysis, that servicer must disclose the factors used in the analysis. However, if a servicer denies a borrower a loan modification option on other grounds, it would be unduly burdensome for the servicer to disclose factors that would have been used, had the servicer done a NPV analysis.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(f) Prohibition on Foreclosure Referral</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>First Notice or Filing</title>
        <analysisParagraph/>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1024.41(f) prohibits a servicer from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless a borrower's mortgage loan is more than 120 days delinquent. A servicer also is prohibited from making such a notice or filing while a borrower's complete loss mitigation application is being evaluated. In response to numerous questions received by the Bureau about the meaning of the phrase “first notice or filing,” the Bureau proposed to redesignate comment 41(f)(1)-1 as comment 41(f)-1, and then revise it to clarify what actions § 1024.41(f) would prohibit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the proposed comment would have stated that whether a document is considered the first notice or filing is determined under applicable State law. Under the proposal, a document that would be used as evidence of compliance with foreclosure practices required pursuant to State law would have been considered the first notice or filing. Thus, a servicer would have been prohibited from sending such a notice or filing such a document during the pre-foreclosure review period or during the review period for a complete loss mitigation application. Documents that would not be used in this fashion would not have been considered the first notice or filing. The proposed comment would have stated expressly that this prohibition does not extend to activity such as attempting to collect the debt, sending periodic statements, sending breach letters, or any other activity during the pre-foreclosure review period, so long as such documents would not be used as evidence of complying with requirements applicable pursuant to State law in connection with a foreclosure process.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledged that, under the proposed interpretation, if a State law mandates a notice to a borrower of the availability of mediation as a prerequisite to commence foreclosure, such notices would be considered the “first notice or filing” for purposes of § 1024.41. The Bureau also recognized that existing State foreclosure processes often can be lengthy. The proposed comment sought to balance protecting consumers and encouraging communication between borrowers and servicers by providing borrowers sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application without the stress and costs of foreclosure, but also permitting servicers to communicate with borrowers to respond promptly to requests. However, recognizing potential practical difficulties for servicers as well as borrower protection concerns that could arise from chilling early communications provided for borrowers under State law, the Bureau sought comment on the best way to establish a workable rule that clearly identifies what is prohibited, while balancing these goals.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received substantial comments from trade associations, individual servicers including credit unions, the GSEs, some State governments, and two consumer advocacy groups, which generally disagreed with the proposed “evidence of compliance with State law” standard and asked the Bureau to reconsider the scope of the prohibition. Numerous commenters, including trade organizations, the GSEs, individual servicers and credit unions, asserted that the proposed comment would cause significant delays in the foreclosure process, especially where the first notice or filing would be followed by lengthy periods mandated by State law before actual initiation of court proceedings or establishing a foreclosure sale date. These commenters asserted that the proposal would have prohibited often lengthy processes from starting until after 120 days of delinquency have passed. For example, commenters noted that Massachusetts requires its own notice and opportunity to cure process that may take up to 150 additional days before foreclosure is filed. Thus, if the notice beginning that cure process is deemed the “first notice” for purposes of the prohibition on foreclosure referral (as it would have been under the proposal), foreclosure proceedings may be delayed until the 270th day of delinquency. One industry commenter raised concerns that such delays would impact compliance with regulatory capital requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters expressed substantial concerns with the proposal's use of the phrase “evidence of compliance with State law.” These commenters asserted that the phrase is vague, and that State law may often require proof of compliance with the mortgage contract's terms, which may include the sending of general default notices not expressly required by statute. The commenters indicated servicers would have difficulty understanding what documents were prohibited and likely would be discouraged from sending any early communications to borrowers if they later must use such document to show compliance with applicable State law.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, State governments, and some consumer advocates indicated that the proposal likely would delay notices required under State-mandated pre-foreclosure programs. As these commenters noted, under the proposal such notices likely would constitute “evidence of compliance with State law” and thus would be prohibited until after the 120th day of delinquency. These commenters also asserted that such programs complement the Bureau's early intervention rule and that there is substantial benefit to borrowers in receiving these notices early in their delinquencies. For example, many statutory notices require that counseling, legal aid, or other resources be identified to borrowers, and consumer groups agreed that borrowers are more likely to respond and seek loss mitigation when they receive notices clearly informing them that foreclosure is imminent if they do not act. Several commenters pointed to data or experience that indicated many borrowers do not reach out to servicers for loss mitigation assistance until foreclosure notices or notices of default are sent. These commenters believed that borrowers would receive little benefit if these notices were delayed until after the 120th day of delinquency because the likelihood of a successful resolution would be reduced. On the whole, these commenters indicated that delaying State-mandated notices relating to loss mitigation programs or statutory rights to cure delinquencies would frustrate State efforts at avoiding foreclosure by making resolutions more difficult or cure more costly to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As an alternative to the proposed interpretation of “first notice or filing,” many industry commenters recommended that the Bureau adopt an interpretation based on the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) definition of “first legal,” citing familiarity with this concept. In the alternative, some industry commenters suggested a more uniform and objective definition or a State-by-State determination. These commenters generally stated that a prohibition that extends to documents defined in a manner that closely tracks “first legal” would better facilitate compliance for industry, while at the same time would permit and encourage the early notices to borrowers, including those that provide counseling, legal aid, or other resources. A number of commenters suggested that specific notices be expressly permitted, including State-mandated outreach to delinquent borrowers and breach letters required by the GSEs.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a revised version of proposed comment 41(f)-1 that states a document is considered the “first notice or filing” on the basis of foreclosure procedure under applicable State law, but adjusts the Bureau's interpretation of what constitutes a “first notice or filing.” Rather than relying on the general notion that any evidence of compliance with State foreclosure law constitutes a first notice or filing, the Bureau is revising comment 41(f)-1 and adopting four new subparts that are more specifically addressed to different types of foreclosure procedures. New comment 41(f)-1.i explains that, when the foreclosure procedure under applicable State law requires commencement of a court action or proceeding, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be filed with a court or other judicial body to commence the action or proceeding (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a complaint, petition, order to docket, notice of hearing). The Bureau also is adopting new comment 41(f)-1.ii, which explains that, when the foreclosure procedure under applicable State law does not require a court action or proceeding, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be recorded or published to initiate the foreclosure process. To address situations not already covered by comments (i) and (ii), new comment 41(f)-1.iii provides that, where a foreclosure procedure does not require initiating a court action or proceeding or recording or publishing of any document, a document is considered a “first notice or filing” if it is the first document which establishes, sets or schedules the foreclosure sale date.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the proposal sought to balance protecting consumers and encouraging communication between servicers and borrowers. The Bureau believed that, under the proposed interpretation of “first notice or filing,” borrowers would be ensured sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application, but servicers would still be able to send many of the typical early-default communications, so long as they were not being used as evidence of compliance with State law. The Bureau requested comment on whether the proposal established a workable rule that was clear, in light of varied foreclosure procedures in different states, and the multiple purposes for notices. As noted above, many commenters, including consumer advocate groups and State governments, indicated concerns with the proposed interpretation's impact on communication and its impact on State-mandated loss mitigation programs. Many commenters asserted that the proposal would result in either less or ineffective early default communication and <em data-original="E-03">lessen</em> the likelihood that borrowers would successfully access loss mitigation resolutions or otherwise avoid foreclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded by these comments that revising the interpretation is necessary to provide greater clarity and also provide for more effective pre-foreclosure outreach. As commenters noted, the proposed interpretation would have prohibited the use of many State-mandated notices that do not initiate foreclosure proceedings and are intended to provide borrowers with information about counseling and other loss mitigation resources as a means of avoiding foreclosure. In addition, the Bureau is persuaded by comments that the proposed interpretation would have chilled other servicer communications, such as cure notices or breach letters, based on confusion over whether such communications were “evidence of compliance” and thus prohibited by § 1024.41.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the interpretation of first notice or filing adopted by this final rule provides an objective basis for determining compliance with the prohibition on foreclosure referral. In addition, it addresses the concerns raised in comments that the proposal would restrict communications informing borrowers of assistance and statutory rights to cure. The Bureau agrees with commenters that permitting communication about cure rights or pre-foreclosure loss mitigation assistance or procedures available under State law, even within the first 120 days of a borrower's delinquency, furthers the objective of § 1024.41's loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau believes early communication to borrowers about resources such as housing counseling, emergency loan programs, and pre-foreclosure mediation will increase the likelihood that borrowers will submit complete applications in time to benefit from the full loss mitigation procedures under § 1024.41. The Bureau appreciates that, under this modified interpretation, some borrowers who have not yet submitted loss mitigation applications may face shorter foreclosure timeframes after the 120th day of delinquency than under the proposed interpretation. However, the Bureau believes the adopted interpretation provides sufficient opportunity for borrowers to seek loss mitigation assistance without the pressure of pending litigation or foreclosure proceedings. The Bureau also believes a borrower's ability to exercise a statutory or contractual right to cure a default likely will be greater where notice of the cure rights is provided before several months of arrearages have accumulated. While the proposed interpretation was not intended to prohibit sending any such notice, only one that would be used as evidence of compliance with applicable law, the modified interpretation provides greater clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that its interpretation of “first notice or filing” may prohibit, during the 120-day period, initiation of State-mandated loss mitigation efforts or opportunities to cure in those jurisdictions where the applicable foreclosure procedure requires such information to appear first in a court filing, or a document that is recorded or published. However, were the Bureau to adopt an interpretation that excluded such notices from the definition of first filing, based on their inclusion of information related to cure rights or loss mitigation assistance, this likely would create significant confusion and frustrate the purposes of the rule, by permitting certain foreclosure actions within the 120-day period.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adding new comment 41(f)-1.iv to clarify that a document provided to a borrower that initially is not required to be filed, recorded or published is not considered the first notice or filing solely on the basis that the foreclosure procedure requires a copy of the document to be included as an attachment to a subsequent document required to be filed or recorded to carry out the foreclosure process. The Bureau is aware through comments that, in many states, letters or notices (including breach letters, notices of rights to cure) that are required to be sent to the borrower, <em data-original="E-03">but do not initiate formal foreclosure proceedings,</em> nonetheless are required to be included in later filings, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> as part of a complaint or subsequent pleading. Such letters or notices may be sent during the pre-foreclosure review period without violating the foreclosure referral ban.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The interpretation of “first notice or filing” adopted by this final rule closely tracks, but may not be identical in all jurisdictions, to the FHA's “first legal action necessary to initiate foreclosure” or “first legal” or “first public” action, as some commenters requested.<footnote ref="24">See Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mortgagee Letter 2005-30, July 12, 2005.</footnote> However, the Bureau believes to the extent there are jurisdictions where “first notice or filing” of § 1024.41(f) is inconsistent with the FHA standard, it will not hinder servicers' compliance with obligations under the FHA or investor requirements based upon the FHA's standard. The Bureau notes that the “first legal” standard primarily serves to inform mortgagees of their contractual obligations as servicers of FHA-insured mortgages. In light of the fact that § 1024.41(f) is enforceable by private right of action, the Bureau is adopting this interpretation of “first notice or filing” in order to provide sufficient clarity to borrowers, servicers, and courts. The Bureau also believes this interpretation provides States with clarity of the application of § 1024.41(f), not just as to present State foreclosure procedure but with respect to future modifications of State law.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to amend § 1024.41(f)(1) so that the prohibition on referral to foreclosure until after the 120th day of delinquency would not apply in two situations: (1) When the foreclosure is based on a borrower's violation of a due-on-sale clause, and (2) when the servicer is joining the foreclosure action of a subordinate lienholder. As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau is aware that there may be some circumstances when a foreclosure is not based upon a borrower's delinquency, and thus protections designed to provide delinquent borrowers time to bring their mortgages current or apply for loss mitigation (such as the 120-day ban on foreclosure referral) may not be appropriate or necessary. The Bureau proposed amending § 1024.41(f)(1) to provide the two exemptions for foreclosures based upon due-on-sale clauses and for joining a subordinate lienholder's foreclosure, but also recognized that other situations may exist that also warrant exclusion. Thus, in addition to the two situations described above, the Bureau sought comment on what other situations may be appropriate to exempt, or whether the proposed exemptions were appropriate in situations in which a borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received substantial comments from trade associations, individual servicers including credit unions, and the GSEs, which generally supported the added exemptions to § 1024.41(f)(1). Industry commenters generally supported the proposed exemptions, citing a need to provide relief from the foreclosure referral ban where default is based upon a non-monetary provision of a mortgage. With respect to the Bureau's request for comment on other situations that may warrant exclusion, numerous commenters suggested the Bureau provide guidance or add exemptions for foreclosure based upon a determination that the property was abandoned or vacant. Some commenters advocated an exemption for abandoned properties and suggested the Bureau provide a list of factors to be considered in determining whether the property was abandoned. Consumer groups, however, expressed concerns that, because abandonment or vacancy status is necessarily a fact-specific determination, an exemption may facilitate evasion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, some commenters suggested the Bureau exempt situations where the borrower is deceased without heirs or in other cases. Some industry commenters requested that the rule permit foreclosure within the 120-day period where borrowers have failed to maintain insurance or property tax payments or where the borrower had failed to pay late fees. Finally, some commenters requested an exemption for other situations including where borrowers commit waste, are non-responsive to the servicer's attempts to maintain live contact, or state a desire to surrender the property.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups acknowledged that situations may exist that warrant exclusion from the 120-day prohibition, such as the proposed exemptions, but raised concerns about their breadth. Specifically, these commenters expressed concerns that an exemption for all foreclosures based on violation of a due-on-sale clause may be overly broad, and could be construed to allow foreclosure where the transfer is to a deceased borrowers' family member or where a transfer occurs as a result of State divorce decree or probate order, or other transfer to a borrower's family member. Many of these commenters suggested that the exemption expressly exclude such transfers to the extent they were protected under the Garn-St. Germain Act.<footnote ref="25">Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act, Public Law 97-320 (1982) (codified in various sections). The Act generally prohibits the exercise of due-on-sale clauses with respect to certain protected transfers. See 12 U.S.C. 1701j-3.</footnote> Consumer advocate commenters also suggested that the exemption for joining a foreclosure action of a subordinate lienholder should be limited to situations where all of the servicers and lienholders with respect to the property are separate entities.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the amendments to § 1024.41(f)(1) as proposed, without adopting additional exemptions. The Bureau appreciates comments that suggested the 120-day prohibition was designed to protect delinquent borrowers, but should not extend to non-monetary defaults or breaches of the underlying mortgage agreement. However, the Bureau remains mindful of consumer protection concerns that could arise from a broader set of exemptions. For example, industry commenters suggested that foreclosure based on a borrower's failure to maintain insurance or pay property taxes should be excluded, but, as some of these commenters acknowledged, those and other examples provided are likely to coincide with borrower delinquency. The Bureau does not believe that servicers should be allowed to sidestep the borrower protections set forth in § 1024.41 for delinquent borrowers simply because borrowers may have breached other components of the underlying mortgage, such as requirements to pay property taxes, maintain insurance, or pay late fees. The Bureau believes that additional exemptions would create uncertainty and could potentially be construed in a manner that permits evasion of the requirements of § 1024.41(f). Moreover, the Bureau does not believe exemption from the pre-foreclosure review period is appropriate merely because foreclosure is based upon an obligation other than the borrower's monthly payment. In many instances, these borrowers are likely experiencing financial distress and thus may benefit from time to seek loss mitigation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to adopt an exemption from the 120-day prohibition for situations where a borrower may be deemed to commit “waste” in violation of an underlying mortgage agreement. As noted above, the Bureau is concerned that such an exemption could be used to circumvent the 120-day prohibition for borrowers who are also delinquent. However, the Bureau also notes that what constitutes waste is very fact-specific and the few commenters who suggested an exemption provided no precise definition of the term. Furthermore, while mortgages typically permit foreclosure in the event of waste, they also frequently provide other non-foreclosure remedies. In light of the absence of evidence suggesting waste that would necessitate rapid foreclosure is a significant problem, the Bureau is convinced that no such exemption is necessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau does not believe any further narrowing or clarifying revisions to the due-on-sale clause exemption in § 1024.41(f)(1)(i), to protect transfers to family members or transfers ordered by divorce decree or probate proceedings, are necessary. The Bureau notes that, to the extent the Garn-St. Germain Act prohibits the exercise of due-on-sale clauses, the exemption from the 120-day period would not apply. The exemption does not alter limitations or obligations imposed on a servicer by another Federal or State law with respect to whether a due-on-sale clause validly may be exercised. Rather it merely provides an exception to the 120-day pre-foreclosure review period where the basis for foreclosure is a due-on-sale clause. The Bureau notes that servicers may not avail themselves of the due-on-sale clause exemption and make the first notice or filing before the 120th day of delinquency unless such a clause is validly enforceable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also not adopting any limitation on the exemption for joining a foreclosure initiated by a subordinate lienholder. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to limit the exemption application to only those situations where the senior and junior liens are held or serviced by separate entities, as was requested. In the case where an entity services both a first and a second lien, the servicer will be required to complete the pre-foreclosure review for the second lien, and will be required to respond to a borrower's loss mitigation application with respect to the first mortgage as well. Furthermore, the comments did not provide an adequate explanation to persuade the Bureau that servicers are more likely to pursue foreclosure in a manner that evades the 120-day pre-foreclosure review period when the senior and junior lien are held and serviced by the same entity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that several commenters requested that the Bureau exempt vacant or abandoned properties from the 120-day prohibition. However, while many commenters asserted that there is a limited benefit to prohibiting foreclosure referral where a property is “vacant” or “abandoned”, they also generally agreed that such a determination depends on the individual facts and circumstances, and may vary according applicable State law. While some commenters suggested the Bureau adopt a multiple-factor test to determine whether a property was “abandoned,” the Bureau believes any such test would inherently rely on a holistic determination based on individual facts and circumstances, and would not provide the clear guideline that the Bureau believes is appropriate with respect to the prohibition on foreclosure referral. Moreover, as noted by consumer groups, a number of borrower protection concerns could arise from affording servicers too much discretion in determining whether a property is abandoned or vacant. In addition, some industry commenters conceded that it would be rare for a property to be determined abandoned or vacant earlier than the 120th day of delinquency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For these reasons, the Bureau is not adopting an exclusion from the 120-day prohibition for vacant or abandoned properties. However, the Bureau notes that the provisions of §§ 1024.39 through 1024.41 apply only to a mortgage loan secured by property that is a borrower's principal residence. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1024.30(c)(2). Thus, depending on the facts and circumstances, it is possible that some foreclosures against vacant or abandoned properties will not be subject to § 1024.41(f).</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau also proposed corresponding amendments to the provision in § 1024.41(j), which provides the same prohibition with respect to small servicers.

The Bureau believes that these amendments are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA and in particular of section 6 of RESPA, including to facilitate the evaluation of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Further, the amendments implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA, which obligates a servicer to take timely action to correct errors relating to avoiding foreclosure, by establishing servicer duties and procedures that must be followed where appropriate to avoid such errors. In addition, the Bureau relies on its authority pursuant to section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial law, including the purpose and objectives under sections 1021(a) and (b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

      <title>41(b)(3) Determining Protections</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add new § 1024.41(b)(3) addressing the borrowers' rights in situations in which no foreclosure sale has been scheduled as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received, or a previously scheduled foreclosure sale is rescheduled after receipt of a complete application. As discussed in the proposal, § 1024.41 is structured to provide different procedural rights to borrowers and impose different requirements on servicers depending on the number of days remaining until a foreclosure sale is scheduled to occur, as of the time that a complete loss mitigation application is received. However, the provisions of § 1024.41 do not expressly address situations in which a foreclosure sale has not yet been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received, or is rescheduled after the application is received. Since issuance of the final rule, the Bureau has received questions about the applicability of the timing provisions in such situations. Specifically, industry stakeholders have asked whether it is appropriate to use estimated dates of foreclosure where a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received. Further, industry stakeholders have requested guidance on how to apply the timelines if no foreclosure is scheduled as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received, but a foreclosure sale is subsequently scheduled less than 90 days after receipt of such application, or if a foreclosure sale has been scheduled for less than 90 days after a complete application is received, but is then postponed to a date that is 90 days or more after the receipt date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed new § 1024.41(b)(3), which stated that, for purposes of § 1024.41, timelines based on the proximity of a foreclosure sale to the receipt of a complete loss mitigation application will be determined as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received. Proposed comment 41(b)(3)-1 would have clarified that if a foreclosure sale has not yet been scheduled as of the date that a complete loss mitigation application is received, the application shall be treated as if it were received at least 90 days before a foreclosure sale. Proposed comment 41(b)(3)-2 would have clarified that such timelines would remain in effect even if at a later date a foreclosure sale was rescheduled.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed this approach would provide certainty to both servicers and borrowers as well as ensure that borrowers receive the broadest protections available under the rule in situations in which a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application. In the proposal, the Bureau also discussed alternative modifications to the rule, which the Bureau declined to propose, including having the applicable timelines vary depending on the newly scheduled (or re-scheduled) sale date, or allowing servicers to estimate when a foreclosure sale might be scheduled. On balance, the Bureau believed that a straightforward rule under which the protections that attach are determined as of the date of receipt of a complete loss mitigation application, and a complete loss mitigation application is treated as having been received 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale if no sale is scheduled as of the date the application is received, is preferable because it would provide industry and borrowers with clarity regarding its application, without the unnecessary complexity that other approaches might produce. The Bureau recognized that the proposed rule might in some cases require a servicer to delay a foreclosure sale to allow the specified time for the borrower to respond to a loss mitigation offer and to appeal the servicer's denial of a loan modification option, where applicable, and sought comment and supporting data regarding circumstances in which this may occur.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry as well as consumer groups addressing these proposed provisions. Overall, commenters appreciated the clarity and simplicity of the proposed rule. They supported the idea that borrower protection should be clear and certain. One consumer advocate expressed concern that the rule limits, but does not eliminate, dual tracking. This commenter was concerned that a sale may be scheduled with less than 37 days' notice. Another consumer advocate suggested the rule should always adopt the most consumer-friendly timeline. That is, if a sale is postponed, a borrower should receive the benefit of any extra protections that might arise given a longer time between the sale and the submission of a complete application; but if a sale is scheduled to occur on a short timeline, the borrower should not lose the original protections that had attached on the basis of the longer timeline.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of the proposed rule. Such commenters were concerned this may inappropriately extend the timeline of a foreclosure sale. These commenters urged the Bureau to limit the appeal right to when a complete application is submitted within 30 days of the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure sale. Alternatively, some commenters urged the Bureau to allow servicers to estimate when a foreclosure sale may occur. For example, one commenter suggested such estimates could be based on estimates provided by nationally recognized sources. Finally, industry commenters expressed concern the proposed provision may not be feasible because a servicer may be unable to move a scheduled foreclosure sale. One commenter recommended the Bureau offer an exemption from liability when an investor or court requires a servicer to continue with a foreclosure sale in violation of the applicable timelines.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1024.41(b)(3) and its related commentary substantially as proposed, but with minor wording changes. For the reasons discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes the final rule appropriately balances consumer protection and servicer needs. This approach provides certainty to both servicers and borrowers, as well as ensures that borrowers receive the broadest protections available under the rule in situations where a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to adopt other approaches suggested in comments. The Bureau notes that structuring the rule such that a borrower's rights may be added or removed because a foreclosure sale was moved or rescheduled would not provide the certainty or simplicity created by the proposed rule. Further, the Bureau is concerned that if moving a foreclosure sale to a later date could trigger new protections, such a policy may provide a disincentive for a servicer to reschedule a foreclosure sale for a later date. Finally, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to limit the appeal rights to when a complete application is submitted within 30 days of the first notice or filing, because, regardless of when a first notice or filing is made, a servicer should be able to provide a borrower an appeal when there is sufficient time before the scheduled foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the rule being finalized, which grants the borrower certain rights if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application before a sale has been scheduled, will cause inappropriate delays in the foreclosure process. First, while some States may schedule foreclosure sales to occur in less than 90 days of the scheduling of the sale, completing the process of reviewing a loss mitigation application may not necessitate a delay in the scheduled sale. For example, if the scheduling of a sale occurs 30 days after a complete loss mitigation application is submitted, and the sale is scheduled for 60 days after the scheduling occurs, the servicer will have sufficient time to follow the complete loss mitigation procedures without having to move the foreclosure sale. Second, servicers control many of the timelines in the process, including the 30-day evaluation window, and the time to process an appeal. If a foreclosure sale is rescheduled to occur in less than 90 days after a borrower submitted a complete application, a servicer does have the option to review the application quickly and, in doing so, the servicer may avoid the need to postpone the foreclosure sale.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In situations where there is a conflict (a later scheduled foreclosure sale that does not allow a servicer or borrower sufficient time to complete the procedures required by the loss mitigation rules), the Bureau expects a servicer to take the necessary steps to avoid having the foreclosure sale occur before the loss mitigation review procedures run their course, including asking a court to move a scheduled foreclosure sale, if necessary. An important objective of the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules is to ensure that loss mitigation applications receive careful review, so that a servicer does not foreclose on a borrower who would have qualified for a loss mitigation option and who timely submitted a complete application for loss mitigation. Consistent with that objective, once a borrower has submitted an application, a servicer should carry out the procedures prescribed by the rule in light of the timing and content of the application. To permit a later scheduled (or rescheduled) foreclosure sale to cut short those procedures would be inconsistent with the objective just described. For these reasons, the Bureau finalizes the rule substantially as proposed, with minor wording changes.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(c)(2)(iii) Payment Forbearance</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to modify § 1024.41(c)(2) to allow servicers to offer short-term forbearance to borrowers based on a review of an incomplete loss mitigation application, notwithstanding that provision's restriction on servicers offering a loss mitigation option to a borrower based on the review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. In adopting the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, the Bureau crafted broad definitions of “loss mitigation option” and “loss mitigation application” for purposes of § 1024.41, to provide a streamlined process in which a borrower will be evaluated for all available loss mitigation options at the same time, rather than having to apply multiple times to be evaluated for different options one at a time. Since publication of the final rule, however, both industry and consumer advocates have raised questions and concerns about how the rule applies in situations in which a borrower needs and requests only short-term forbearance. For instance, a number of servicers have inquired about whether the rule would prevent them from granting a borrower's request for waiver of late fees or other short-term relief after a natural disaster until the borrower submits all information necessary for evaluation of the borrower for long-term loss mitigation options. Additionally, both consumer advocates and servicers have raised questions about whether a borrower's request for short-term relief would later preclude a borrower from invoking the protections afforded by the rule if the borrower encounters a significant change in circumstances that warrants long-term loss mitigation alternatives.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau was conscious of the difficulties involved in distinguishing short-term forbearance programs from other types of loss mitigation and of the concern that some servicers may have significantly exacerbated borrowers' financial difficulties by using short-term forbearance programs inappropriately instead of reviewing the borrowers for long-term options. Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that it was possible to revise the rule to facilitate appropriate use of short-term payment forbearance programs without creating undue risk for borrowers who need to be evaluated for a full range of loss mitigation alternatives.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>At the outset, the Bureau noted that it does not construe the existing rule to require that servicers obtain a complete loss mitigation application prior to exercising their discretion to waive late fees. Additionally the Bureau noted that, under the rule as adopted, a servicer may offer any borrower any loss mitigation option if the borrower has not submitted a loss mitigation application or if the offer is not based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, as clarified in existing comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to short-term forbearance programs that involve more than simply waiving late fees, such as where a servicer allows a borrower to forgo making a certain number of payments and then to catch up by spreading the unpaid amounts over some subsequent period of time, the Bureau believed that the issues raised by various stakeholders could most appropriately be addressed by providing more flexibility to servicers to provide such relief even if it is based on review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. Thus, the Bureau did not propose to change the current definition of loss mitigation option, which includes all forbearance programs. Rather, the Bureau proposed to relax the anti-evasion restriction in § 1024.41(c)(2)(i), which prohibits a servicer from offering a loss mitigation option based upon an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau thus proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), which would have allowed short-term payment forbearance programs to be offered based on a review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. The proposed exemption would have applied only to short-term payment forbearance programs. Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-1 stated that a payment forbearance program is a loss mitigation option for which a servicer allows a borrower to forgo making certain payments for a period of time. Short-term payment forbearance programs may be offered when a borrower is having a short-term difficulty brought on, for example, by a natural disaster. In such cases, the servicer offers a short-term payment forbearance arrangement to assist the borrower in managing the hardship. The Bureau explained that, in its view, it is appropriate for servicers to have the flexibility to offer short-term payment forbearance programs prior to receiving a complete loss mitigation application for all available loss mitigation options. Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-1 also would have explained that a short-term program is one that allows the forbearance of payments due over periods of up to two months.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted that, under the proposed approach, servicers that receive a request for short-term payment forbearance and grant such requests would remain subject to the requirements triggered by the receipt of a loss mitigation application in § 1024.41. Thus, as explained in proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-2, if a servicer offers a payment forbearance program based on an incomplete loss mitigation application, the servicer still would be required to review the application for completeness, to send the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice to inform the borrower whether the application is complete or incomplete, and if incomplete what documents or additional information are required, and to use reasonable diligence to complete the loss mitigation application. If a borrower in this situation submits a complete application, the servicer must evaluate it for all available loss mitigation options. The Bureau believed that maintaining these requirements is important to ensure that borrowers are not inappropriately diverted into short-term forbearance programs without access to the full protections of the regulation. At the same time, if a borrower in fact does not want an evaluation for long-term options, the borrower may simply refrain from providing the additional information necessary to submit a complete application and the servicer will therefore not be required to conduct a full assessment for all options.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To ensure that a borrower who is receiving an offer of short-term payment forbearance understands the options available, proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) would have required a servicer offering a short-term payment forbearance program to a borrower based on an incomplete loss mitigation application to include in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice additional information, specifically that: (1) The servicer has received an incomplete loss mitigation application and on the basis of that application the servicer is offering a short-term payment forbearance program; (2) absent further action by the borrower, the servicer will not be reviewing the incomplete application for other loss mitigation options; and (3) if the borrower would like to be considered for other loss mitigation options, he or she must submit the missing documents and information required to complete the loss mitigation application. The Bureau believed that providing borrowers this more specific information is important to ensure that borrowers do not face unwarranted delays and paperwork and that servicers do not misuse short-term forbearance to avoid addressing long-term problems.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-3 to clarify servicers' obligations on receipt of a complete loss mitigation application. The proposed comment would have stated that, notwithstanding that a servicer may have offered a borrower a payment forbearance program after an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, and even if the borrower accepted the payment forbearance offer, a servicer must still comply with all requirements in § 1024.41 on receipt of a borrower's submission of a complete loss mitigation application. This proposed comment was intended to clarify that, even though payment forbearance may be offered as short-term assistance to a borrower, a borrower is still entitled to submit a complete loss mitigation application and receive an evaluation of such application for all available loss mitigation options. Although payment forbearance may assist a borrower with a short-term hardship, a borrower should not be precluded from demonstrating a long-term inability to afford the original mortgage, and being considered for long-term solutions, such as a loan modification, when that may be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from both industry and consumer group commenters on this provision. Commenters were generally very supportive of allowing an exclusion from the full loss mitigation procedures for short-term problems, that is, problems that can be quickly resolved (e.g., a borrower needed new tires for his or her car and thus falls a month behind on mortgage payments). They asserted that short-term problems are better resolved quickly and that the full loss mitigation procedures should apply only to consumers with long-term problems. One industry commenter stated that the paperwork of the full procedures would be seen as burdensome when a borrower had a short-term problem, and this would be perceived as poor customer service. Additionally, commenters pointed out that, under § 1024.41(i), a borrower is entitled to the full procedures for only a single complete loss mitigation application, and it would not be in the borrower's best interest to “waste” that single evaluation under the full procedures on a simple, short-term problem. Consumer advocate commenters suggested that borrowers should be warned before they use their single evaluation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Both consumer advocate and industry commenters expressed concern that the two-month forbearance contemplated by the proposed rule was too brief. Such commenters urged the Bureau to permit payment forbearances of as long as six months or a year, to allow borrowers the opportunity to resolve their problems (for example, attempting to find a new job) before using up their opportunities to be evaluated for long-term options, such as a loan modification. Further, commenters expressed that the industry standard for payment forbearance programs was longer than two months—often six months or even a year. Finally, commenters expressed that short-term forbearances were particularly important for addressing two situations, unemployment and natural disasters.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) generally as proposed. However, in light of comments received, the Bureau has made some adjustments to the proposed provisions. As discussed below, the Bureau is clarifying the servicer's reasonable diligence obligation when a borrower has been offered a payment forbearance based on evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, and the Bureau has adjusted the limit on the length of payment forbearances that would be allowed under this provision.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Payment forbearance based on an incomplete application. The Bureau is adopting, with some adjustments, the general exclusion for short-term forbearance from the prohibition on offering loss mitigation based on an incomplete application. The Bureau continues to believe this exclusion is appropriate, because it should provide servicers greater flexibility to address short-term problems quickly and efficiently. Further, because the exclusion applies to decisions based on review of incomplete loss mitigation applications, it will allow the borrower's short-term problems to be addressed while preserving a borrower's single use of the full § 1024.41 loss mitigation procedures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to exclude payment forbearance from the definition of loss mitigation. The final rule provides the same benefits in flexibility that would be achieved by revising the definition of loss mitigation while preserving important consumer protections. If a borrower requests payment forbearance, he or she should be regarded as having requested loss mitigation under the terms of § 1024.41, and the procedures generally required by the rule should take place. Further, the Bureau notes that a borrower always has the option of completing his or her loss mitigation application and receiving a full evaluation for all options. This is reflected in comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-3, which states that even if a servicer offers a borrower a payment forbearance program after an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, the servicer must still comply with all other requirements in § 1024.41 if the borrower completes his or her loss mitigation application.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the new provision addresses only payment forbearance that is offered based on an evaluation of an incomplete application. The Bureau is aware, as some commenters noted, that situations may arise where a borrower completes a loss mitigation application and goes through a full loss mitigation evaluation, and the end result is the borrower being offered a payment forbearance—which would exhaust his or her single use of the § 1024.41 loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau notes that some consumer advocates asked the Bureau to exempt any such loss mitigation evaluation from the successive request provision in § 1024.41(i), or require that such borrowers be warned so they know not to complete their application if they are seeking only payment forbearance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau acknowledges these concerns, the Bureau notes that the proposal was limited to discussing payment forbearance based on incomplete applications, and comments addressing payment forbearance based on complete applications are beyond the scope of the proposed rule. Further, the Bureau notes that the loss mitigation rules are intended to address only procedures, and leave the substantive decisions on different loss mitigation programs to the discretion of the owner or assignee. Finally, the Bureau notes that any issues related to the second or successive request provision in § 1024.41(i) would more appropriately be addressed in a rulemaking focusing on that provision.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Payment forbearance and reasonable diligence. The proposed provision on payment forbearance included a modification to the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, which would have required the notice to include additional information when a servicer was offering a borrower payment forbearance based on an incomplete application. While the Bureau believes it is important for borrowers to be informed that they are being offered payment forbearance based on an incomplete loss mitigation application and they may receive a full review for all other options by completing their applications, the Bureau believes that servicers should have flexibility to provide this message at the appropriate time. A servicer may, in some circumstances, need to communicate additional information regarding payment forbearance. For example, a servicer may require additional information—short of a complete loss mitigation application—to offer a borrower a payment forbearance program. Further, the Bureau acknowledges that a servicer may decide to offer a borrower payment forbearance at various stages of the loss mitigation process, and the message should be provided at the appropriate time. For example, if a servicer needs additional information before offering payment forbearance, the servicer might not decide to offer a borrower payment forbearance until after the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice has been sent out. In light of these considerations, the Bureau declines to finalize the provision regarding modification of the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice in the context of payment forbearance. Instead, the Bureau has amended comment 41(b)(1)-4, added paragraph 4.iii, which addresses a servicer's reasonable diligence obligations. The comment explains that, when a servicer offers a borrower payment forbearance based on an incomplete application, the servicer should notify the borrower that the borrower may complete the application to receive a full evaluation of all loss mitigation options available to the borrower.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a servicer's diligence obligations may vary depending on the facts and circumstances. In some instances, it may be appropriate for servicers to include this additional information in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. For example, if a servicer decides to offer a borrower payment forbearance based on the initial submission that establishes the loss mitigation application (e.g., the borrower calls the servicer and, on the basis of that call, the servicer decides to offer the borrower payment forbearance), the servicer might include the message (that the borrower is being offered payment forbearance but may complete the application to receive a full evaluation) in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, along with the full list of information and documents necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. Alternatively, if the servicer wanted to offer the borrower a payment forbearance program, but needed a few additional documents to do so, the servicer might send a § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice explaining that the borrower has the option of submitting a few items and receiving payment forbearance, or submitting all the missing information and receiving a full evaluation. If the borrower submitted only the items for the payment forbearance and the servicer offered the borrower a payment forbearance program, at that time the servicer could to notify the borrower that he or she has the option of completing the application.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, if the servicer does not decide to offer a payment forbearance program based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application until after the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice has been sent, the servicer would still have the option of offering the borrower payment forbearance at that later time. The servicer would notify the borrower that he or she has the option of completing the application at the time the servicer offered the payment forbearance program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adding a new subpart to comment 41(b)(1)-4 to further elaborate on the servicer's reasonable diligence obligation when a borrower is considered for short-term forbearance under this provision. Once a borrower has begun a payment forbearance program, the Bureau believes the servicer need not continue to request missing items from the borrower during the course of the payment forbearance program, unless the borrower fails to comply with the payment forbearance program or the borrower indicates he or she would like to continue completing the application. Thus, comment 41(b)(1)-4.iii states that, once a servicer provides this notification, the servicer could suspend reasonable diligence efforts until near the end of the payment forbearance program, so long as the borrower remains in compliance with the payment forbearance program and does not request any further assistance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that, unless the borrower has brought his or her loan current, it may be necessary for the servicer to contact the borrower prior to the end of the forbearance period to determine if the borrower wishes to complete the application and proceed with a full loss mitigation evaluation. Thus, comment 41(b)(1)-4.iii states that near the end of the program, and prior to the end of the forbearance period, it may be necessary for the servicer to contact the borrower to determine if the borrower wishes to complete the application and proceed with a full loss mitigation evaluation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Length of payment forbearance. The Bureau is amending the proposed interpretation of “short-term” forbearance, in light of public comments that supported the general exception, but suggested that an exception permitting only two-month forbearances would be of limited benefit to borrowers and servicers. The Bureau is persuaded that a two-month payment forbearance window may not allow the borrower sufficient time to remedy even some short-term problems. As adopted, comment 41(b)(2)(iii)-1 explains that “short-term” forbearance means a program that allows the forbearance of payments due over periods of no more than six months, as opposed to two months. The Bureau notes that this six-month period may cover time both before and after the payment forbearance was granted (for example, if a borrower is one month delinquent when a servicer offers a payment forbearance program, the program may only extend 5 months into the future). The Bureau believes the extended timeline allows the servicer sufficient flexibility to address most short-term situations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau was concerned that, if a servicer offered a borrower a payment forbearance of more than two months, the borrower may lose the benefit of the 120-day foreclosure referral prohibition in § 1024.41(f)(1), because the 120 days may run out during the course of the forbearance plan. The Bureau believes that, as part of a payment forbearance program as contemplated by this rule, a servicer should not foreclose on a borrower who is complying with the payment forbearance program. To make explicit that this restriction is an aspect of the payment forbearance programs permissible under the new provision, the Bureau has added a foreclosure protection clause to the payment forbearance provision in § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments requesting longer payment forbearance programs and noting that existing programs that may be offered through HUD or HAMP, or by the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (collectively “GSEs”), may offer payment forbearance for periods extending beyond six months to a year, particularly in situations such as natural disaster or unemployment. The Bureau remains convinced that, if a borrower has a long-term problem, such a borrower should, if the borrower chooses, receive a full evaluation for all loss mitigation options. Because forbearance programs under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) should only be used for temporary problems, the Bureau believes it is important to reassess a borrower's situation after no more than six months.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the new rule does not preclude a servicer from offering multiple successive short-term payment forbearance programs. As discussed below in the Section 1022(b)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act analysis, the Bureau has sought to ensure that borrowers would receive significant benefits from the additional option without losing protections provided by § 1024.41. Commenters strongly felt that a short forbearance period would not provide much additional benefit to borrowers, and further explained that a payment forbearance of less than a year may interfere with existing programs under HUD, HAMP, and the GSEs. The Bureau acknowledges that a borrower will generate a significant unpaid debt over the course of a long forbearance period. However, the Bureau notes that a borrower who believes the circumstances warrant cutting a long forbearance short can receive a full review for all loss available mitigation options by submitting a complete loss mitigation application. In addition, the Bureau believes that the risk servicers would attempt to evade the full loss mitigation procedures by offering sequential six-month forbearances to delinquent borrowers is low. Thus, the Bureau believes that borrowers benefit more from renewable forbearance agreements than they would benefit from any limit the Bureau might impose at this time on the maximum number of forbearances. The Bureau notes, however, that while the final rule does not prohibit a servicer from offering multiple short-term forbearances under this provision, the Bureau intends to monitor how temporary forbearances are used after this final rule becomes effective and, if it determines servicers are inappropriately offering sequential payment forbearances, may address the issue in a later rulemaking or by other means at a later date.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>41(c)(2)(iv) Facially Complete Application</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau proposed new § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), which stated that if a servicer creates a reasonable expectation that a loss mitigation application is complete but later discovers additional documents or information is needed to evaluate the application, the servicer shall treat the application as complete as of the date the borrower had reason to believe the application was complete, for purposes of applying § 1024.41(f)(2) and (g), until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the loss mitigation application. This provision was designed to work together with proposed new comments 41(b)(2)(i)-1 and -2, as discussed above, to address situations when a servicer determines that an application the servicer previously determined to be complete (or to be missing particular information) is in fact is lacking additional information needed for evaluation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has received questions about the impact of an error in the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), particularly in light of the short time the servicer has to review the information submitted by the borrower. As discussed above, the Bureau recognizes that, in certain circumstances, an application may appear to be complete (or to be missing only specific information), but the servicer, upon further evaluation, may determine that additional information is needed before the servicer can evaluate the borrower for all available loss mitigation options. The proposed commentary to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i) was intended to clarify that servicers are required to obtain the missing information in such situations. Proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) was intended to protect borrowers while a servicer requests the missing information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-1 would have clarified that a reasonable expectation is created when the borrower submits all the missing items (if any) identified in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. When a reasonable expectation that a loss mitigation application is complete is created but the servicer later discovers that the application is incomplete, proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) would have provided that the servicer shall treat the application as complete for certain purposes until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to supply the missing information necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. Specifically, under this provision, the servicer would need to treat the application as complete for purposes of the foreclosure referral prohibition in § 1024.41(f)(2) and the foreclosure sale limitations in § 1024.41(g). Proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) would have ensured that servicers that made bona fide mistakes in making initial determinations of completeness need not be considered in violation of the rule, and that borrowers do not lose protections under the rule due to such mistakes. The Bureau believed that, once a borrower is given reason to believe he or she has the benefit of certain protections (which are triggered by submission of a complete loss mitigation application), if the servicer discovers that an application is incomplete, the borrower should have a reasonable opportunity to complete the application before losing the benefit of such protections.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-2 would have provided guidance on what would be a reasonable opportunity for the borrower to complete a loss mitigation application. The comment states that a reasonable opportunity requires that the borrower be notified of what information is missing and be given sufficient time to gather the information and submit it to the servicer. The amount of time that is sufficient for this purpose would depend on the facts and circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) would preserve servicers' obligation to conduct rigorous up-front reviews, while providing servicers the ability to correct a good-faith mistake or clerical error. Further, servicers seeking relief under the provision need only give borrowers a reasonable opportunity to provide the missing information, thus allowing a servicer to continue the foreclosure process if a borrower does not provide such information.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1024.41(b)(2)(i), the Bureau received comments from industry as well a consumer groups addressing these proposed provisions. Commenters were generally supportive of the Bureau addressing situations where a servicer later discovers additional documents or information are required to complete a loss mitigation application. However, commenters sought additional clarification on several aspects of the proposed amendment. First, commenters sought clarification on when a borrower's rights or protections are triggered. Commenters also expressed concern that it was unclear when a reasonable expectation had been created. For example, one commenter stated that a servicer may argue a homeowner had no reasonable expectation even if a complete application was submitted. Second, commenters sought clarification as to what would be considered a reasonable amount of time for a borrower to complete an application. Commenters suggested a set number of days should be given. Finally, commenters asked what happens after the missing information is provided or a reasonable time passes and the borrower fails to provide the information. Some commenters stated that the application should be considered complete only as of the date the missing information was provided and the application was actually completed. Other commenters stated the application should be treated as if it were complete when the reasonable expectation was created. One commenter pointed out that the expectation should be created based on the borrower's action (submitting the items requested in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice), rather than on an action (or inaction) of the servicer. As this commenter noted, if a borrower initially submits a complete application, the related protections of the rule should be triggered when the borrower submits the application, not when the servicer sends the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. Therefore, this commenter asserted, if a borrower is asked to provide certain items, the protections should be triggered when those items are provided, not when the servicer deems the application to be complete. Finally, some commenters suggested the proposed revisions should go further and require a confirmation notice, as well as provide additional guidance on the timing and content of that notice. For example, one commenter suggested that servicers should be required to explain the reason a particular document does not meet underwriting guidelines, rather than simply requesting the document again.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a final version of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) that is similar to the proposed version, but with some modifications. First, the Bureau is not including the “reasonable expectation” standard set forth in the proposal. Instead, the provision as adopted states that, if a borrower submits all the missing information listed in the notice required pursuant to § 1026.41(b)(2)(i)(B), or if no additional information is requested in such notice, the application shall be considered “facially complete” and will trigger certain borrower protections. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes the subjective nature of the term “reasonable expectation” could have resulted in unnecessary compliance challenges and confusion as to when a reasonable expectation had been established. The Bureau believes the concept of facial completeness, on the other hand, provides greater clarity to servicers and borrowers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau is modifying proposed § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) to enhance borrower protections by providing that servicers are required to treat a “facially complete” application as complete for purposes of the § 1026.41(h) appeal right and the borrower response timelines in § 1024.41(e). As discussed above, proposed § 1026.41(c)(2)(iv) would have required servicers to treat the application as complete for purposes of the foreclosure referral ban in § 1024.41(f)(2) and the foreclosure sale limitations in § 1024.41(g) until the borrower had been given a reasonable opportunity to supply the missing information necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. However, for purposes of the appeal right under § 1024.41(h) and the borrower response timelines under § 1024.41(e), the proposal would have treated the application as complete only once the borrower submitted the additional information or documents needed to evaluate the application. Thus, under the proposal, if a servicer gave a borrower a reasonable expectation that he or she had submitted a complete application more than 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale but later requested more information pursuant to new § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), the borrower might not have received the right to an appeal or to a 14-day response time depending on the timing of the supplemental information request and the borrower's response. The Bureau has been persuaded that such a borrower should enjoy the benefit of the appeal right and the 14-day response timeline. Furthermore, the Bureau is persuaded by the comment that suggested that the protections of § 1024.41 should be triggered based on the date when a borrower submits all the documents and information as stated in the § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, rather than when the servicer deems the application to be complete.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, under § 1026.41(c)(2)(iv) as adopted by the final rule, if a borrower submits a facially complete application that is later found by the servicer to require additional information or corrected documents to be evaluated, and the borrower subsequently provides the corrected documents or information necessary to complete the application, the application is treated as complete, for the purposes of § 1024.41(d), (e), (f)(2), (g), and (h), as of the date it was facially complete. However, the 30-day window during which the servicer must evaluate the borrower for all available loss mitigation options (as required pursuant to § 1026.41(c)) will begin only when the servicer receives the missing information. The Bureau continues to believe there is little value in requiring a servicer to evaluate a loss mitigation application when a servicer has determined certain items of information are missing.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, Bureau has adopted new comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-2 to address situations in which a borrower fails to provide the missing information within a reasonable timeframe as prescribed by the servicer. This comment states that, if the borrower fails to complete the application within the reasonable timeframe, the servicer may treat the application as incomplete.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not addressing in this final rule comments that suggested further protections for borrowers are needed, including additional notice requirements. The Bureau believes these concerns are adequately addressed. Several protections already established by the rule, including the requirement to have polices and procedures reasonable designed to achieve the objective of facilitating compliance with the requirement to send an accurate § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice (in § 1024.38(b)(2)(iv); the continuity of contact requirements in § 1024.40, and the obligation on the servicer to use reasonable diligence in completing an application already require that servicers work with borrowers to complete a loss mitigation application. For example, the reasonable diligence obligation requires servicers to promptly seek documents or information necessary to complete a loss mitigation application, which the Bureau believes includes an obligation to work proactively with borrowers when they discover any additional documents or information are needed to complete the application, as well as notify a borrower when a submitted document is insufficient to complete an application—for example, because a signature is missing. Servicers cannot be dilatory in seeking such materials or corrected documents. Given these and other protections and obligations, the Bureau believes borrowers will be adequately protected, because the rules should ensure they receive the benefits of foreclosure protections at the time their applications are facially complete, and will continue to receive those protections once they have submitted the additional materials. The Bureau notes that a servicer that complies with § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement to provide an accurate § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. The Bureau believes this approach appropriately balances the servicer's need to collect additional pieces of information while still providing protection for the borrower.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1024.39Early intervention requirements for certain borrowers 1024.39(d) Exemptions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The early intervention requirements in § 1024.39 are intended to provide delinquent borrowers with opportunities to pursue available loss mitigation options at the early stages of a delinquency by requiring that the servicer attempt to make live contact with the borrower and to issue a written notice. The requirements apply to each payment for which the borrower is delinquent, although the written notice must be provided only once every 180 days.<footnote ref="15">


          The Bureau has issued guidance to clarify how a servicer may comply with the requirements in § 1024.39 to make good faith efforts to establish live contact with a borrower in CFPB Bulletin 2013-12,available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201310_cfpb_mortgage-servicing_bulletin.pdf.

        </footnote>
        In this interim final rule, the Bureau is adding new § 1024.39(d)(1), exempting a servicer from the early intervention requirements while a borrower is a debtor in bankruptcy, and new § 1024.39(d)(2), exempting a servicer from the early intervention requirements when a borrower has invoked the cease communication provisions under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA).<footnote ref="16">

          15 U.S.C. 1692et seq.

      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau first proposed the early intervention requirements in § 1024.39 on August 10, 2012. In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Bureau noted that servicers may be subject to State and Federal laws related to debt collection practices, such as the FDCPA. In addition, the preamble acknowledged that the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provisions generally prohibit, among other things, actions to collect, assess, or recover a claim against a debtor that arose before the debtor filed for bankruptcy.<footnote ref="17">

        </footnote>
        The Bureau invited comment on whether servicers may reasonably question how they could comply with the Bureau's proposal in light of those laws.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters expressed concern that the Bureau's rules overlap with and could conflict with existing State and Federal law. Several commenters requested guidance on whether servicers would be required to comply with the early intervention requirements if the borrower instructed the servicer to cease collection efforts, not to contact the borrower by telephone, or if the borrower refused to pay the debt. Several of these commenters requested that the Bureau include an exemption from the early intervention requirements in cases involving debt collection or bankruptcy law. One industry commenter requested that the Bureau clarify whether servicers would have immunity from claims of harassment or improper conduct under the FDCPA.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to addressing potential conflicts between the Bureau's rules and existing State and Federal law as well as existing industry practice, commenters identified a variety of ways the Bureau could provide relief, including by not adopting rules that exceed or otherwise conflict with existing requirements, providing safe harbors (such as by clarifying that compliance with existing laws and agreements satisfies § 1024.39), adopting more flexible standards, providing exemptions, including a mechanism in the rule to resolve compliance conflicts, or broadly preempting State laws.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On January 17, 2013, the Bureau issued the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule with early intervention requirements in § 1024.39 that included a conflicts of law provision specifying that servicers are not required to make contact with borrowers in a manner that may be prohibited by Federal laws, such as the FDCPA or the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provisions. The Bureau also added comment 39(c)-1, addressing borrowers in bankruptcy. The comment specified, “Section 1024.39 does not require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner that would be inconsistent with applicable bankruptcylaw or a court order in a bankruptcy case. To the extent permitted by such law or court order, servicers may adapt the requirements of § 1024.39 in any manner that would permit them to notify borrowers of loss mitigation options.” In the preamble to the final rule, the Bureau stated that it did not seek to interpret the Bankruptcy Code through this comment, but instead intended to indicate that servicers could take a flexible approach to complying with § 1024.39 for borrowers in bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>1024.39(d)(1) Borrowers in bankruptcy.</title>
      <analysisParagraph>After publication of the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, industry stakeholders expressed continued concerns to the Bureau about complying with certain servicing requirements for borrowers under the protection of bankruptcy law. In general, and as discussed further below with regard to periodic statement requirements, servicers asserted that simply providing flexibility in accommodating bankruptcy law restrictions on communications with borrowers was not sufficient because they faced a substantial legal burden in determining when and how bankruptcy law provisions applied in the first instance. Servicers also expressed concern about how to fulfill the servicing rules' requirements in a way that did not confuse borrowers with regard to their status in bankruptcy and the fact that servicers were not attempting to collect on accounts. Bankruptcy trustees raised similar concerns about the likelihood of servicers providing information that will be confusing to borrowers/debtors, debtor attorneys, and even courts and trustees. Specifically, with regard to early intervention, industry sought additional guidance on whether the Bureau would require some attempt at compliance even if there was an automatic stay and whether servicers would be subject to claims by private litigants asserting that bankruptcy was not an excuse for a servicer's lack of performance under § 1024.39.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on these inquiries, the Bureau believes that the potential interactions between the § 1024.39 early intervention requirements and bankruptcy law requirements can be highly varied and complex. The Bankruptcy Code itself provides a robust set of consumer protections for debtors, including oversight of debt repayment plans, where applicable. However, whether certain communications with the borrower may violate an automatic stay or discharge injunction are fact-specific inquiries and can vary depending on the Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code at issue, the intention of the debtor to retain the property, and the frequency and detailed contents of the communications.<footnote ref="18">See infra note 35; see also In re Duke, 79 F.3d 43 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding creditor does not violate automatic stay when sending “nonthreatening and non-coercive” offer to reaffirm Chapter 7 debtor's pre-petition debt); In re Silva, No. 09-02504, 2010 WL 605578 (Bankr. D. Haw.

        Uncertainty with respect to loss mitigation-related communications has led federal regulators<footnote ref="19">See, e.g., HUD, Mortgagee Letter 2008-32 (Oct. 17, 2008) (“[M]ortgagees must, upon receipt of notice of a bankruptcy filing, send information to debtor's counsel indicating that loss mitigation may be available, and provide instruction sufficient to facilitate workout discussions including documentation requirements, timeframes and servicer contact information . . . .

        and several bankruptcy courts<footnote ref="20">See, e.g., Amended General Order Regarding Negotiations Between Debtor(s) and Mortgage Servicer(s) to Consider Loan Modifications (Bankr. D.N.J. July 24, 2009) (“[C]ommunications and/or negotiations between debtors and mortgagees/mortgage servicers about loan modification shall not be deemed as a violation of the automatic stay . . . . [A]ny such communication or negotiation shall not be used by either party against the other in any subsequent litigation . . . .”) available at http://www.njb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/general-ordes/2009_07_27_generalOrderLoanModify2.pdf; Bankr. W.D. Wash. R. 4001-2(b) (“A mortgage creditor's contact with the debtor and/or the debtor's counsel for the purposes of negotiating a loan modification shall not be considered a violation of the automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C. 362.”). While these two courts' rules might permit some communications regarding loan modifications, their approach is not necessarily generally accepted.</footnote>
        to issue guidelines or rules for servicers on the interaction between those communications and bankruptcy law. While some sources identified by the Bureau suggest that it is permissible for servicers to engage in loss mitigation negotiations with borrowers who have invoked bankruptcy protections, they do not address affirmative outreach directly to the borrower to solicit discussions about loss mitigation options.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, when a borrower is under bankruptcy protections, the benefits of continuing early intervention contacts may depend on the context. Borrowers who became delinquent on their mortgage loans prior to filing bankruptcy will likely already have received early intervention contacts from the servicer and thus will already be on notice about the availability of potential loss mitigation options. In such cases, continuing contacts may have limited if any utility. And while the small group of borrowers who file bankruptcy without first becoming delinquent on their mortgage loans might benefit from information regarding the availability of loss mitigation information, the Bureau is concerned that additional guidance is needed to ensure that any early intervention contacts communicate effectively regarding the borrower's status in bankruptcy and do not instead create borrower confusion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that further study of these issues is warranted but cannot be concluded quickly enough to provide further calibration of the requirements before January 2014. Therefore, the interim final rule adds § 1024.39(d)(1), which exempts servicers from the requirements of § 1024.39 for a mortgage loan while the borrower is a debtor in bankruptcy. However, the Bureau is not taking any position on whether early intervention efforts generally may violate an automatic stay or discharge injunction and encourages servicers who communicate with borrowers in bankruptcy about loss mitigation options to continue such tailored communications so far as bankruptcy law permits. The Bureau believes that some borrowers facing the complexities of bankruptcy could benefit from receiving loss mitigation information in some tailored form that is appropriate to their circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Because of the new exemption addressing bankruptcy in § 1024.39(d)(1), the interim final rule removes comment 39(c)-1 and incorporates it into new commentary in § 1024.39(d)(1)-2, as discussed below. Comment 39(d)(1)-1 clarifies that the exemption begins once a petition has been filed commencing a case under Title 11 of the United States Code in which the borrower is a debtor. Comment 39(d)(1)-2 clarifies that with respect to any portion of the mortgage debt that is not discharged, a servicer must resume compliance with § 1024.39 after the first delinquency that follows the earliest of any of three potential outcomes in the borrower's bankruptcy case: (i) the case is dismissed, (ii) the case is closed, or (iii) the borrower receives a discharge under 11 U.S.C. §§ 727, 1141, 1228, or 1328. However, this requirement to resume compliance does not require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner that would be inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case. To the extent permitted by such law or court order, a servicer may adapt the requirements of § 1024.39 in any manner believed necessary. Compliance with § 1024.39 is not required for any portion of the mortgage debt that is discharged under applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the borrower's bankruptcy case is revived for example if the court reinstates a previously dismissed case, reopens the case, or revokes a discharge the servicer is again exempt from the requirement in § 1024.39. Comment 39(d)(1)-3 clarifies that the exemption applies when any of the borrowers who are joint obligors with primary liability on the mortgage loan is a debtor in bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed, the Bureau is providing this exemption at this time, particularly because of the complex compliance concerns and the impending effective date of the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule. The Bureau will continue to examine this issue and may reinstate an early intervention requirement with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy, but it will not reinstate any such requirement without notice and comment rulemaking and an appropriate implementation period. The Bureau solicits comment on the scope of the exemption, the triggers for meeting the exemption and having to resume early intervention, and how the early intervention communications might be tailored to meet the particular needs of borrowers in bankruptcy. The Bureau also seeks comment on other factors the Bureau should take into consideration in determining whether to reinstate any type of early intervention requirement with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Legal Authority.</em> The Bureau uses its authority under RESPA sections 6(j)(3) and 19(a) to exempt servicers from the early intervention requirements in § 1024.39 for a mortgage loan while the borrower is a debtor in bankruptcy and to adopt related official Bureau interpretations in Supplement I to Part 1024. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau does not believe at this time that the consumer protection purposes of RESPA would be furthered by requiring servicers to comply with § 1024.39 for a mortgage loan while the borrower is a debtor in bankruptcy.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>1024.39(d)(2) Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</title>
      <analysisParagraph>A servicer of defaulted mortgage loans may also be a debt collector under the FDCPA. The FDCPA grants debtors the right generally to bar debt collectors from communicating with them regarding the debt by sending a written “cease communication” request.<footnote ref="21">15 U.S.C. 1692c(c).</footnote>
        As discussed above, the Bureau is separately issuing a bulletin that concludes that the FDCPA “cease communication” provision does not override servicers' obligations to have various communications with borrowers that are specifically mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act or to respond to certain borrower-initiated communications in accordance with the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules.<footnote ref="22">The new mortgage servicing rules that do not exempt servicers based on their status as debt collectors under the FDCPA are, in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.35 (error resolution), 1024.36 (requests for information), 1024.37 (force-place insurance), and 1024.41 (loss mitigation) and, in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.20(d) (ARM initial interest rate adjustment) and 1026.41 (periodic statement). See CFPB Bulletin 2013-12, available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201310_cfpb_mortgage-servicing_bulletin.pdf. Note that, elsewhere in this interim final rule, the Bureau is issuing an exemption for § 1026.20(c) similar to the one for § 1024.39.</footnote>
        However, because the early intervention requirements are neither statutorily mandated nor borrower-initiated, the interplay between the early intervention requirements and the “cease communication” provision of the FDCPA is less clear than it is with the servicing provisions discussed in the bulletin.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, new § 1024.39(d)(2) exempts a servicer that is a debt collector under the FDCPA with respect to a borrower from the requirements of § 1024.39 after the borrower has exercised this “cease communication” right. The exemption provides a servicer that is a debt collector under the FDCPA with certainty that it has no obligations under § 1024.39 with regard to a borrower who has followed FDCPA procedure and instructed the servicer/debt collector to stop communicating with the borrower about the debt. The Bureau is not, however, making a determination as to the legal status of intervention efforts following receipt of proper cease communication requests, and servicers are encouraged to pursue loss mitigation options to the extent that the FDCPA permits.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The CFPB will be exploring the legal issues and practical benefits of requiring some type of early intervention to notify borrowers of the potential availability of loss mitigation options, in an upcoming rulemaking on debt collection. Balancing the rights of debtors to protect themselves against certain debt collector practices with the consumer protections afforded by servicer-borrower contact that may lead to the resolution of borrower default is more appropriately addressed in the broader context of a notice-and-comment rulemaking. For this reason, the interim final rule revises § 1024.39 to add the exemption discussed above and provide clarity to stakeholders, but the Bureau notes that the future rulemaking on debt collection may alter or eliminate this exemption.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Legal Authority.</em> The Bureau uses its authority under RESPA sections 6(j)(3) and 19(a) to exempt a servicer that is a debt collector pursuant to the FDCPA with regard to a mortgage loan from the early intervention requirements in § 1024.39 when a borrower has exercised the “cease communication” right under the FDCPA prohibiting the servicer/debt collector from communicating with the borrower regarding the debt. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau believes at this time that the consumer protection purposes of RESPA would not be furthered by requiring compliance with § 1024.39 at a time when a borrower has specifically requested the servicer/debt collector to stop communicating with the borrower about the debt.</analysisParagraph>
