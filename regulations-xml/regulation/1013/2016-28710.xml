Section 130(f) protects <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessors</ref> from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any interpretation issued by the <ref target="1013-2-c" reftype="term">Bureau</ref>.</content>

            <content>Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that it interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § <ref target="1013-4-f" reftype="internal">1013.4(f)</ref> are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment <ref target="1013-4-f-1-Interp-1" reftype="internal">4(f)(1)-1</ref> and comment 4(f)(2)-1. In other cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for example, as comment <ref target="1013-4-a-Interp-1" reftype="internal">4(a)-1</ref>. This introduction may be cited as comments I-1 through I-4. An appendix may be cited as comment app. <ref target="1013-A-1" reftype="internal">A-1</ref>.</content>

        <title type="keyterm">Threshold amount.</title>
        <content>A consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. The threshold amount in effect during a particular time period is the amount stated in comment 2(e)-11 for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Comment 2(e)-11 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900. If a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part because the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the lease remains exempt regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount.</content>

                <content>Section <ref target="1013-4-g-1" reftype="internal">1013.4(g)(1)</ref> requires a full description of the method of determining an early termination charge. The <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> should attempt to provide consumers with clear and understandable descriptions of its early termination charges. Descriptions that are full, accurate, and not intended to be misleading will comply with § <ref target="1013-4-g-1" reftype="internal">1013.4(g)(1)</ref>, even if the descriptions are complex. In providing a full description of an early termination method, a <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> may use the name of a generally accepted method of computing the unamortized cost portion (also known as the “adjusted <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">lease</ref> balance”) of its early termination charges. For example, a <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> may state that the “constant yield” method will be utilized in obtaining the adjusted <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">lease</ref> balance, but must specify how that figure, and any other term or figure, is used in computing the total early termination charge imposed upon the consumer. Additionally, if a <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> refers to a named method in this manner, the <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> must provide a written explanation of that method if requested by the consumer. The <ref target="1013-2-h" reftype="term">lessor</ref> has the option of providing the explanation as a matter of course in the <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">lease</ref> documents or on a separate document.</content>
