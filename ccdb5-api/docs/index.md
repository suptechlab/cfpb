# What's available in the API?

This API provides programmatic search access to the public information in the CFPB's [database of consumer complaints](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/).
Search results can be returned in json, csv, xls, or xlsx formats.

Details on its use can be found [here](documentation/).

#### Notes

The database generally updates daily, and contains details such as the source of the complaint, the date of submission, the company the complaint was sent to, actions taken by the company in response, and whether the companyâ€™s response was timely. If a consumer opts to share their description of what happened, we publish it after removing any personal information. Companies also have the option to select a public response. Company-level information should be considered in the context of company size and/or market share. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.
