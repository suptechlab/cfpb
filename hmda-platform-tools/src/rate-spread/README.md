## Rate Spread Calculator

The rate spread calculator generates the spread between the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and a survey-based estimate of APRs currently offered on prime mortgage loans of a comparable type utilizing the “Average Prime Offer Rates” fixed table or adjustable table, action taken, amortization type, lock-in date, APR, fixed term (loan maturity) or variable term (initial fixed-rate period), and reverse mortgage.

To ensure the most accurate result based on regulatory requirements for reporting rate spread, please use this rate spread calculator for loans with a final action taken on or after January 1st, 2018, and use the old rate spread calculator for loans with a final action taken date prior to January 1st, 2018. Data requirements for the rate spread calculator are provided in accordance with Regulation C effective January 1st, 2018.
