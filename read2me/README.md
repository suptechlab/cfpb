# read2me [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

> Pass strings to a function at a reading pace to help chat bots feel more human. [time2read](https://github.com/cfpb/time2read) is used for pausing between sentences.

## Installation

First install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Then:

```sh
npm install read2me --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
var read2me = require('read2me');
var sentences = [
  'Hello, I am a bot. I must follow three rules:',
  '1. I must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.',
  '2. I must obey the orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.',
  '3. I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.'
];

read2me(sentences, chat, cb);

// However you get your bot to say something, e.g. res.send if you're using Hubot
// https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#send--reply
function chat(sentence) {
  console.log(sentence);
}

function cb() {
  console.log("I'm all done talkin'!");
}
```

Results in:

```
Hello, I am a bot. I must follow three rules:
// pauses 3025 milliseconds
1. I must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
// pauses 5185 milliseconds
2. I must obey the orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
// pauses 5815 milliseconds
3. I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
// pauses 5950 milliseconds
