## File Format Verification Tool

The [File Format Verification Tool](https://cfpb.github.io/hmda-platform-tools/file-format-verification/) is an electronic file format verification tool for filers who wish to confirm that a LAR is formatted in the required pipe delimited text file format. This verification tool will be available on a webpage that runs independently from the HMDA Platform and provides a convenient test mechanism for filers.
