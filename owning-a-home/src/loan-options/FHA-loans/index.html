          <p class="bump"><strong>For borrowers with good credit and a medium (10-15 percent) down payment,</strong> FHA loans tend to be more expensive than conventional loans. For borrowers with lower credit scores or a smaller down payment, FHA loans can often be the cheapest option. But there are no hard-and-fast rules&mdash;a lot depends on the current market. If you’re not sure, ask lenders for quotes for both options and compare total costs to see which offers the best overall deal.</p>

          <h3>Mortgage insurance: what you need to know</h3>

           <p><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for mortgage insurance. You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both. </p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time.</p>
