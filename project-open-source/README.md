# Project-Open-Source

## Our Goals

Open source software has been used within the federal government for years, but agency use varies greatly. Project Open Source hopes to dispel some of the uncertainties and doubts about the usage and benefits of open source software for government agencies. 

This repository will be a resource that includes case studies for how agencies have dealt with common open source problems, examples of agency-specific open source-related policies, and sample contract language.
