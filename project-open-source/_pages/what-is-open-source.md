## What is open source?

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), is publicly available code that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for use, modification, or redistribution. Some FOSS include terms associated with how the software can be used, but is open to be administered and maintained by a variety entities rather than a single vendor.

FOSS is useful when identifying a solution to a problem.
