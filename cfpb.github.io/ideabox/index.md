IdeaBox aims to further the innovative and collaborative culture within the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by harnessing the intellect and
creativity of employees stationed across the country.
It provides an online platform for all agency employees,
regardless of level or geography,
to share and build ideas on how to further the agency’s mission of
improving the financial lives of consumers,
as well as enhance the Bureau’s operations.
The staff leading IdeaBox reviews the ideas for impact and feasibility,
incubates the best ones into action plans,
and navigates them through decision-making channels for possible implementation.

IdeaBox was developed by the CFPB and is integrated into
its open source intranet platform, Collab.
Similar to other ideation platforms, IdeaBox allows users to
share, like, tag, and comment on ideas.
Users can also sort ideas by most liked, recently added, and trending,
which is determined by recent likes or comments.
Since launching nine months ago, the program has crowdsourced over 100 diverse
ideas and incubated a range of solutions at varying levels of complexity.
