# cf-typography

Basic typography styling, including heading hierarchy, links, and some handy webfont mixins.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework, a new front end framework
developed at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://cfpb.github.io/).

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to Capital Framework,
we encourage you to [start here](https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework). (Coming soon.)

- [See the raw demo](http://cfpb.github.io/cf-typography/demo/)

(Docs and demo built with the excellent [Topdoc](https://github.com/topcoat/topdoc/).)

## Building the component

### Requirements

- [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
- [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
- That's it! NPM will help you install everything else you need.

### Workflow

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into its root
2. `npm install` – Initializes Grunt in this folder and installs dependencies.
3. `grunt vendor` – Pulls in Bower components.
4. `grunt` – Compiles LESS files and generates the docs and demo pages.


## Using this component independent of Capital Framework

If you're already using [Bower](http://bower.io/), simply add this component as a dependency
and integrate it into your build process.
It's not currently in the Bower registry, so you'll have to point to this Git repo's URL.

You can also just view the CSS in the `demo` folder and snag what you want.
