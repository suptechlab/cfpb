# cf-colors

Less color variables for the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://cfpb.github.io/) color palette.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://cfpb.github.io/).

## Using this component independent of Capital Framework

If you're already using [Bower](http://bower.io/), simply add this component as a dependency
and integrate it into your build process.
It's not currently in the Bower registry, so you'll have to point to this Git repo's URL.

You can also just view the Less in the `src` folder and snag what you want.
