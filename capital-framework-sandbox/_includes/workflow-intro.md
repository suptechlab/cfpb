You are free to pull in the components however you wish;
but, the [cf-demo](https://github.com/cfpb/cf-demo)
repository is our recommended workflow for using them.
It is also a sample front-end project.
[Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) are used
to pull component source files in to sample project Less and JS files
and for compiling these files into a [sample page](https://cfpb.github.io/cf-demo/).
