Much like [Topcoat](https://github.com/topcoat) each component is its own
repository.
Components can be used by themselves, but they were made to work together.

Currently, we are using [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage the downloading
and updating of components and their dependencies within a project.
This setup provides a lot of flexibility;
for example you can choose to include only the components that you need,
and you can add or update components as you need them, all through [Bower](http://bower.io/).
This makes it easier for projects using the framework
to take advantage of updates and bug fixes at their own convenience.
We hope this leads to more contributions to the framework;
meaning if something is broken and you fix it you'll be fixing it for everyone
(but only if they want it).
