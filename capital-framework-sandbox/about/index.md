Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the following goals: consolidate front-end code patterns across CFPB web products in a collaborative way, adhere to design and UX standards set forth by the CFPB Design Manual, respect the guiding principles of accessibility, and support a wide range of browsers.

As a work of the United States Government, all code is open source and in the public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within a Capital Framework componentâ€™s TERMS). We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.

## Browser support & testing

We actively test Capital Framework components in the following browsers:

- Chrome
- Safari

- Opera

- Android 4+

### Accessibility

We deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of our componets are 508 compliant. We actively test components to ensure that they are keyboard and screen reader friendly.
