## About the data and Consumer Credit Index
The Consumer Credit Index brings together three dimensions of consumersâ€™ credit profiles:
delinquent debt, existing credit availability, and access to new credit.
The index is constructed using anonymized quarterly credit record data maintained by one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies.
