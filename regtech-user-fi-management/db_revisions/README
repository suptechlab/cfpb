Alembic [link](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) is the tool to maintain SBL database upgrades and downgrades.
Each of upgrade and downgrade instructions are grouped into different files that can be found under `versions` folder.
Alembic is using table named `alembic_version` in database to keep track the latest executed alembic_version

To create new database update:
- change current directory to root.
- run `poetry run alembic revision -m "<your new ascript name>"` to generate empty revision file.
- update new revision file (under `versions` folder) with upgrade and downgrade instructions.

To execute alembic: `poetry run alembic upgrade <version>` or `poetry run alembix downgrade <version>`
