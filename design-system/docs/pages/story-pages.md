status: Proposed
description: The story page uses full-bleed images and scaled-up headings to
  create highly visual pages that help to tell a narrative or story. The
  template should be used sparingly for content that needs a more visceral or
  emotional impact. Reserve the use of story pages for higher-profile
  initiatives. An example of a story page is the [racial equity
  page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/racial-equity).

        variation_specs:
          On desktop, the H1 in the hero is rendered at [display heading
          size](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/headings#web-headings-1)
          while all H2s are bumped up to H1 size (34px / 2.125 ems) from their
          standard size (26px / 1.625 em). H3s and below render at standard
          sizes.
use_cases: >-
  When to use


  * You want to tell a story or make a statement; and 

  * You want the story or statement to have emotional impact that will be enhanced with the use of full-bleed images and large headings; and

  * The page is intended to be fairly high-profile (e.g. a director's priority page)


  When not to use


  * You want to quickly direct readers to specific content on a given topic. Use the [sublanding](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/sublanding-pages) or [browse page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/browse-pages) instead. 

  * The content is informational and text-heavy, such as an article or blog post. Use the [learn page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/learn-pages) instead.
guidelines: >
  ### Content guidelines

  The hero area should contain an H1, without any additional introductory subcopy.

  * 41 characters max (one-line heading)

  * 82 characters max (two-line heading)


  H2:

  * Headings should form the narrative backbone of the page - when read together, they should tell a story.
behavior: Full-bleed images will shrink to fit as the viewport is resized.
