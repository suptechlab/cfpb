# impression-testing

This repo contains user research impression testing campaigns contained in the
`/campaign/` directory and organized by date the campaign was created.

Each campaign has a `/campaign/[campaign date and title]/src/` directory that
contains the impression test's JavaScript, CSS, and images.

## Create your own impression testing campaign.

1. Create a new branch.
2. Duplicate the latest entry in the `/campaign/` directory.
4. Name your campaign folder in the format `MMDDYYY-descriptive-title`.
5. Edit the HTML, JS, CSS, and replace the images as necessary in your
campaign directory.
6. Open a pull request for your branch and merge your changes into the repo to
publish your campaign at the URL
`https://cfpb.github.io/impression-testing/campaign/[MMDDYYY-descriptive-title]/[HTML-PAGE-TITLE].html`.
