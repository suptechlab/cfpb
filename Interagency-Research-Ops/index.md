## How to use the research operations site 

Documentation lies at the core of research operations setup. This site is meant to be a one-stop-shop for research operations guidance, templates, and tools across the federal family. It can also serve as an advocacy platform for agencies starting up their UX/CX research practices to benchmark what has worked for other federal departments. 

_Caveat_: This site will not meet each agencies needs, rather, be an example of how to start thinking through how to draft internal research processes to fit your agencies wants/needs, and allow research teams to scale. This guide is evolving so if there are additional resources you'd like to contribute please submit an issue ticket [here.](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/issues/new/choose)
