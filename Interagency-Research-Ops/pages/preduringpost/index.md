# Pre, during, post research process 
_Explainer: Cross linking to materials in guide and breaking the research process into phases_

## Overarching guidance for all stages of research 
- [Veterans adminsitration research documentation.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-at-va) So much good information that cuts across research topics like recruiting, data analytics, conversations guide templates, synthesizing, and sharing findings with stakeholders
- [USDS discovery sprint guide](https://sprint.usds.gov/)
- [Digital services playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov)
  
## Pre
- [Kickoff mural template](https://app.mural.co/t/cfpb6639/m/cfpb6639/1715962430218/1dbcd773f7cea3403c5e8ee78ee16c71fb668bc6?sender=ed483a60-4aa2-459e-9cc5-99ef9086460b)
- [Kickoff mural template as a PDF](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/blob/main/assets/Kickoff%20Mural%20Template.pdf)

## During
- [Usability testing report template - an overview.](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/blob/main/assets/Usability%20testing%20report%20template%20overview.pdf) --for use in project pages or standalone reports
- [Screener template](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/blob/main/assets/Screener%20Template.docx)
- [Moderators guide Template](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/blob/main/assets/Moderators%20Guide%20Template.docx)
- [Usability testing day with assistive technology checklist from GSA](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Usability-testing-day-checklist)
- [VA research template](https://github.com/cfpb/Interagency-Research-Ops/blob/main/assets/VA%20Research%20Template.docx)

## Post 

## How the VA is using AI in Research

PII/PHI if any is recorded during research sessions, gets scrubbed out by researcher during beginning of synthesis and analysis, and before any notes or transcripts can be uploaded to a cloud storage system like Github or EnjoyHQ. Therefore, when a research findings report is created, it should not contain any PII/PHI. This is why we chose to use the reports as the foundation to craft stories using AI.

We first created a template for stories using [Axios Smart Brevity](https://www.axioshq.com/smart-brevity?msclkid=d461c309940b1d037f48a5232027465c&utm_term=smart%20brevity&utm_campaign=BI+-+Smart+Brevity&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=3148500346&hsa_cam=20538044856&hsa_grp=1225956468342897&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=o&hsa_tgt=kwd-76622539330093:loc-190&hsa_kw=smart%20brevity&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=bing&hsa_ver=3&msclkid=d461c309940b1d037f48a5232027465c) as inspiration. After we wrote a few stories using this template, we were satisfied with the style and tone, but realized it still took considerably time to complete even with a template. About the same time we were testing this template, ChatGPT became available. Since our research reports are publicly available in Github, we thought we would test its capabilities. After some experimentation, we were able to narrow the steps to write a story based on a research report from 3 steps to one step. We are very satisfied with the output for telling a brief and easily digestible story that always has a link to the full research report if the reader wishes to "dive deeper." However, the success we have had may depend on the structure of the research report template that is used as the foundation to write the story. I will attach the report and story template so you can review.
