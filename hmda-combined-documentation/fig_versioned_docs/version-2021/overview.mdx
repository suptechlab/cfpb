These resources are briefly described in this section and are further detailed throughout this document in individual sections.

The HMDA agencies have agreed that filing HMDA data collected in or after 2017 with the Bureau will be deemed as a submission to the appropriate Federal agency. [^1]

The FIG includes the following sections:

<PrintPage />

### 1.1 &nbsp; Changes to the Submission Process for Data Collected in 2021

This section provides a summary of the changes made to the submission process for filing HMDA data collected in 2021 with the Bureau.

This section may be useful for employees in a variety of roles, for example, your institution’s:

- Compliance Officer

- Staff who collect, prepare, and submit HMDA data

- HMDA technology support staff

### 1.2 &nbsp; 2021 File Specifications

This section provides information including valid values, how to format your loan/application register, and how to file your HMDA data collected in 2021 with the Bureau.

This section may be useful for employees in a variety of roles, for example, your institution’s:

### 1.3 &nbsp; 2021 Data Specifications

On October 15, 2015, the Bureau issued a final rule ([2015 HMDA Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/28/2015-26607/home-mortgage-disclosure-regulation-c)) amending Regulation C. In August 2017, the Bureau issued a final rule amending the 2015 HMDA Rule primarily to make technical corrections and clarify amendments ([2017 HMDA Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/13/2017-18284/home-mortgage-disclosure-regulation-c)). In August 2018, the Bureau issued an interpretive and procedural rule ([2018 HMDA Rule](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/bcfp_hmda_interpretive-procedural-rule_2018-08.pdf)) to implement and clarify the amendments to HMDA made by section 104(a) of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Act). Beginning with data collected in 2018, HMDA filers should report the data points described in the 2015 HMDA Final Rule and the 2017 HMDA Final Rule, as modified by the 2018 HMDA Rule for insured depository institutions and insured credit unions reporting transactions covered by a partial exemption.

This section provides instructions for what to enter into each data field in the loan/application register.

This section may be useful for employees in a variety of roles, for example, your institution’s:

- Compliance officer

- Staff who collect, prepare, and submit HMDA data

### 1.4 &nbsp; 2021 Edit Specifications

This section lists the edits that financial institutions must run on HMDA data before filing with the Bureau.

This section may be useful for employees in a variety of roles, for example, your institution’s:

[^1]: The HMDA agencies are the member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)—the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

## 2. Changes to the Submission Process for Data Collected in 2021 {#changes}

### 2.1 &nbsp; Items that have changed:

There are no significant changes to the submission process for data collected in 2021 and reported in 2022.

### 2.2 &nbsp; Items that have not changed:

#### The data fields to be collected and reported have not changed:

The required data fields for the 2021 data have not changed from the 2020 data collection and reporting requirements. Please refer to Regulation C, the 2018 HMDA Rule, and the Data Specification section for the 2021 requirements.

#### The loan/application register file format for submitting your HMDA data:

Financial institutions will submit data collected in a pipe delimited text file (.txt). Data fields will be separated by a pipe character, “|”, and will not be fixed length. Do not include leading zeros for the purpose of making a data field a specific number of characters. Additional information regarding the loan/application register file format can be found in the “Self Service Knowledge Portal” located at [https://ffiec.cfpb.gov](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov).

Text entries in alphanumeric fields do not need to use all uppercase letters with the exception of:

- “NA” used when the reporting requirement is not applicable;

- Two-letter state codes;

- A capital “E” at the beginning of any “Exempt” response.

A loan/application register formatting tool will be provided to help filers format certain data into a pipe delimited text file. This tool may be especially helpful for filers with small volumes of reported loans that do not use vendor or other software to prepare their HMDA data for submission. Information regarding the loan/application register formatting tool will be located at [https://ffiec.cfpb.gov](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov).

#### The way you submit your HMDA data:

Filers will submit their HMDA data using a web interface referred to as the HMDA Platform. Information regarding the HMDA Platform can be located at: [https://ffiec.cfpb.gov](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov).

We recommend that HMDA filers use a modern browser, such as the latest version of Google Chrome™, Mozilla® Firefox®, Internet Explorer® 11, Microsoft Edge™, or other modern browsers.

The following submission methods will _not_ be permitted:

- PC Diskette and CD-ROM

- Submission via Web (from the Data Entry Software (DES))

- E-mail to [HMDASUB@FRB.GOV](mailto:HMDASUB@FRB.GOV)

- Paper Submissions

#### The process by which you validate the edit report:

Financial institutions must address all edits _prior to_ submitting their HMDA data. In contrast to the previous process for filing data with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), all edits must now be addressed prior to filing HMDA data with the Bureau in order to complete the submission process.

The edit report will be web-based:

- Edit reports will _not_ be e-mailed to filers in PDF format. Instead, the Bureau edit reports will be viewed and can be downloaded from the HMDA Platform.

- Responses to the edits will not be faxed or e-mailed to the Bureau. The HMDA Platform will guide filers through the process of addressing edits.

#### The agency with which you file _resubmissions_ of your HMDA data:

A resubmission means that you have already filed your HMDA submission and received a confirmation receipt, but you are submitting again for the same filing year.

Beginning with data collected in 2017, filers will resubmit their HMDA data to the Bureau.

#### The Officer Certification process:

As part of the submission process, an authorized representative of your institution with knowledge of the data submitted shall certify to the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted. Filers will not fax or e-mail the signed certification.

#### The contact information for HMDA Help:

Technical questions about reporting HMDA data collected in or after 2017 should be directed to hmdahelp@cfpb.gov.

## Technical questions about reporting HMDA data collected in or before 2016 should be directed to hmdahelp@frb.gov.

As with previous submissions:

- The first row of the loan/application register will begin with the number one (1) to indicate that the data fields in row one contain information relating to your institution.

- All subsequent rows of the loan/application register will begin with the number two (2) to indicate that the data fields beginning in row two contain data fields for the loan/application register, with information relating to the reported loan or application.

## 5. 2021 Edit Specifications {#edit-specifications}

### 5.1 &nbsp; Introduction

HMDA edits are rules to assist filers in checking the accuracy of HMDA data prior to submission. There are four types of edits:

- **Syntactical**: Edits that check whether the loan/application register is in the correct format and whether the data covers the correct filing year. A syntactical edit occurs, for example, if none of the rows in the loan/application register begin with the number two (2) to indicate that the following data fields contain information relating to the reported loan or application. The loan/application register cannot be submitted until the filer corrects all syntactical edit errors and re-uploads the updated loan/application register to the HMDA Platform.

- **Validity**: Edits that check whether there are valid values in each data field. A validity edit occurs, for example, if the contact person’s telephone number does not follow the format “999-999-9999.” The loan/application register cannot be submitted until the filer corrects all validity edit errors and re-uploads the updated loan/application register to the HMDA Platform.

- **Quality**: Edits that check whether entries in the individual data fields or combinations of data fields conform to expected values. A quality edit occurs, for example, if the reported Tax Identification Number does not match the Tax Identification Number the institution reported on the previous year’s loan/application register. The loan/application register cannot be submitted until the filer either confirms the accuracy of all values flagged by quality edits in the HMDA Platform or corrects the flagged values and re-uploads the updated loan/application register to the HMDA Platform.

- **Macro Quality:** Edits that check whether the submitted loan/application register as a whole conforms to expected values. A macro quality edit occurs, for example, if the reported percentage of multifamily loans exceeds 10% of the loan/application register entries. The loan/application register cannot be submitted until the filer either confirms the accuracy of all the values flagged by the macro quality edits in the HMDA Platform or corrects the flagged values and re-uploads the updated loan/application register to the HMDA Platform.

### 5.3 &nbsp; 2021 Edits

Table 4 through Table 8 list all of the edits for HMDA data collected in 2021 under the HMDA Final Rule. Each table groups the edits by type and whether the edit is related to the data fields in the “Filing Institution, Reporting Period, and Contact Information (Transmittal Sheet)” section or the “Loan/Application Register” section. Edits for data collected in 2021 are grouped by data point and may contain more than one condition that must be true for the edit to pass during filing. Conditions within the edit description are distinguished with a number. To increase clarity, the tables contain a column specifying each data field that affects the overall edit, and the edit descriptions contain all data field names in italics.
