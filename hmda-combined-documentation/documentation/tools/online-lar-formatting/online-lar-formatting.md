### Editing a Record

#### Editing status

The heading of the [Editor](#editing-a-row) will remind you whether you are:

- Creating or Updating the current [Editor](#editing-a-row) row
  - ex. `Creating a new LAR Row`
  - ex. `Updating LAR Row 1`
- Working with TS vs LAR
  - ex. `Creating a new LAR Row`
  - ex. `Creating Transmittal Sheet`

#### Parsed Values

Edit the selected row with guided enumerations, examples, and field descriptions. Changes are not persisted until you click [`Save/Update`](#row-actions).

- **Enumerations**: Drop-down menus for enumerated values (i.e. Loan Type).
- **NA/Exempt**: Buttons for easy exception inputs.
- **Dates**: Date-picker with easily readable date format. Values are automatically converted between the display-format and the lar-format (yyyymmdd).

#### Pipe-Delimited Values

Edit the selected row as if you were directly in the LAR file. Changes are not persisted until you click [`Save/Update`](#row-actions).

- **Clipboard Copy/Paste**: Easily import/export data between applications.
- **Linking with Parsed Values**: Selecting a field in the text area will highlight the same field in [`Parsed Values`](#parsed-values) to make editing data easier with the guided enumerations, examples, and field descriptions.

## Creating a LAR file from scratch

### Create a Transmittal Sheet (TS) row

- Fill out your Insitution's information
- Click [`Save Row`](#row-actions)
- You will see your TS in the [`Saved Records`](#saved-records) section.
- Note: There is only one TS per LAR file.
- Now you can begin creating `Loan/Application Register (LAR)` rows.

### Create a Loan/Application Register (LAR) row

- Click the [`New Row`](#row-actions) button to remove any previously entered data.

### Edit a row

- Selecting a record from the [`Saved Records`](#saved-records) will populate that row's data in the [`Editing`](#editing-a-record) section of the app.
  - [`Parsed Values`](#parsed-values) provides examples of field inputs, field and input descriptions, and easy selectors for enumerated fields.
  - [`Pipe-Delimited Values`](#pipe-delimited-values) provides the row's raw text, as it will appear in your downloaded LAR file.
    - Clicking in a field will highlight that value in the [`Parsed Values`](#parsed-values) section for quick editing.

Unsaved data entered in the [`Editing`](#editing-a-record) section is not included in the downloaded LAR file.
- The file is saved to your browser's default download directory.
- The data is now formatted into a pipe-delimited text file ([as shown below](#lar-file-output)) and ready to be submitted to the HMDA Platform.

## Editing an existing LAR file

### Upload your file

Use the [`Upload File`](#file-actions) button to select your file. All processing is done in your browser, no data is sent to the CFPB.

Note: Rows without a valid `Record Identifier` are filtered out during data parsing and presented in a [`Records for review`](#please-review) section. You should review and correct these records.

### Search the TS/LAR data

Use the [`Saved Records`](#saved-records) area to find records relevant to your focus.

- You can search the text of your file using the `Search TS` and `Search LAR` boxes.
- You can filter which fields are shown using the `Filter columns/Filter by label` boxes.

### Edit a row

Selecting a record in [`Saved Records`](#saved-records) will populate that row's data in the [`Editing`](#editing-a-record) section of the app.

- [`Parsed Values`](#parsed-values) provides examples of field inputs, field and input descriptions, and easy selectors for enumerated fields.
- [`Pipe-Delimited Values`](#pipe-delimited-values) provides the row's raw text, as it will appear in your downloaded LAR file.
  - Clicking in a field will highlight that value in the [`Parsed Values`](#parsed-values) section for quick editing.

### Save changes

After making your changes, use the [`Download File`](#file-actions) button to download your LAR file.

The data is now formatted into a pipe-delimited text file ([as shown below](#lar-file-output)) and ready to be submitted to the HMDA Platform.

## LAR File Output

The LARFT produces pipe-delimited, UTF-8 encoded LAR files. Files contain at least 1 TS and 1 LAR row.

**Note**: Aside from the `Record Identifier`, data uploaded to the LARFT is **not** checked for validity. You can submit your file on the [HMDA Beta Platform](https://ffiec.beta.cfpb.gov) to test for Edits.
