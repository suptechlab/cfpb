"HMDA" refers to the `Home Mortgage Disclosure Act`_, a law that requires
financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home
purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications. This data is made public and is available from the US Government at the `FFIEC HMDA Products`_ site.
