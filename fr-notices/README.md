fr-notices
==========

In a few cases, we edit the XML for a Federal Register notice to make it easy
to parse with our [regulations-parser](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser). We store those changes here.

**Note**: These are unofficial changes. All official notices are available through [the Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/consumer-financial-protection-bureau).

## Usage

Use these notices with our [regulations-parser](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser) as part of the [eRegulations](http://cfpb.github.io/eRegulations/) project.
