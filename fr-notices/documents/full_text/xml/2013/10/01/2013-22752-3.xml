          <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Summary of Final Rule</HD>
          <P>In January 2013, the Bureau issued several final rules concerning mortgage markets in the United States (2013 Title XIV Final Rules), pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>In June 2013, the Bureau proposed several amendments to those final rules (&#x201C;June 2013 Proposal&#x201D;).<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>This final rule adopts with some revisions and additional clarifications the June 2013 Proposal. It makes several amendments to the provisions adopted by the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules to clarify or revise regulatory provisions and official interpretations primarily relating to the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules and the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, as described further below. This final rule also makes modifications to the effective dates for provisions adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, and certain technical corrections and minor refinements to Regulations B, X, and Z. The specifics of these amendments and modifications are discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU>Specifically, on January 10, 2013, the Bureau issued Escrow Requirements Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 4726 (Jan. 22, 2013) (2013 Escrows Final Rule), High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 FR 6856 (Jan. 31, 2013) (2013 HOEPA Final Rule), and Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 6407 (Jan. 30, 2013) (2013 ATR Final Rule). The Bureau concurrently issued a proposal to amend the 2013 ATR Final Rule, which was finalized on May 29, 2013. See 78 FR 6621 (Jan. 30, 2013) and 78 FR 35430 (June 12, 2013). On January 17, 2013, the Bureau issued the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, 78 FR 10901 (Regulation Z) (Feb. 14, 2013) and 78 FR 10695 (Regulation X) (Feb. 14, 2013) (2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules). On January 18, 2013, the Bureau issued the Disclosure and Delivery Requirements for Copies of Appraisals and Other Written Valuations Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), 78 FR 7215 (Jan. 31, 2013) (2013 ECOA Final Rule) and, jointly with other agencies, issued Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, 78 FR 10367 (Feb. 13, 2013). On January 20, 2013, the Bureau issued the Loan Originator Compensation Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 11280 (Feb. 15, 2013) (2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule).</P>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>2</SU>Amendments to the 2013 Mortgage Rules Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), and the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 39902 (July 2, 2013).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>First, the Bureau is adopting several modifications to provisions of Regulation X adopted by the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, including those related to error resolution procedures and information requests (&#xA7;&#xA7; 1024.35 and 1024.36), and loss mitigation (&#xA7; 1024.41). With respect to loss mitigation, two of the revisions concern the requirement in &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(2)(i) that a servicer review a borrower's loss mitigation application within five days and provide a notice to the borrower acknowledging receipt and informing the borrower whether the application is complete or incomplete. If the servicer does not deem the application complete, the servicer's notice must also list the missing items and suggest the borrower provide the information by the earliest remaining of four dates specified in the regulation. The changes replace the four specified dates with a requirement that a servicer give a borrower a reasonable date by which the borrower should in which to provide the missing information. New commentary explains the four dates previously specified in the regulation are now treated as milestones that the servicer should consider in selecting a reasonable date, however the final rule allows servicers more flexibility than the existing rule. The changes also set forth requirements and procedures for a servicer to follow in the event that a facially complete application is later found by the servicer to require additional information or corrections to a previously submitted document in order to be evaluated for loss mitigation options available to the borrower. Another modification provides servicers more flexibility in providing short-term payment forbearance plans based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application. Other clarifications and revisions address the content of notices required under &#xA7; 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) and (h)(4), which inform borrowers of the outcomes of their evaluation for loss mitigation and any appeals filed by the borrowers. In addition, the amendments address how protections are determined to apply where a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time the borrower submits a loss mitigation application or when a foreclosure sale is rescheduled. Finally, the amendments explain what actions constitute the &#x201C;first notice or filing&#x201D; for purposes of the general ban on proceeding to foreclosure before a<PRTPAGE P="60383"/>borrower is 120 days delinquent, and provide exemptions from the 120-day prohibition for foreclosures for certain reasons other than nonpayment.</P>
          <P>Second, the Bureau is clarifying and revising the definition of points and fees for purposes of the qualified mortgage points and fees cap and the high-cost mortgage points and fees threshold, as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, respectively. In particular, the Bureau is adding commentary to &#xA7; 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) to clarify for retailers of manufactured homes and their employees what compensation must be counted as loan originator compensation and thus included in the points and fees thresholds. The Bureau also is adding commentary to clarify the treatment of charges paid by parties other than the consumer, including third parties, for purposes of the points and fees thresholds.</P>
          <P>Third, the Bureau is revising two exceptions available under the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules to small creditors operating predominantly in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; areas pending the Bureau's re-examination of the underlying definitions of &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; over the next two years, as it recently announced it would do in Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) (May 2013 ATR Final Rule).<SU>3</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Bureau is extending an exception to the general prohibition on balloon features for high-cost mortgages under &#xA7; 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) to allow all small creditors, regardless of whether they operate predominantly in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; areas, to continue originating balloon high-cost mortgages if the loans meet the requirements for qualified mortgages under &#xA7;&#xA7; 1026.43(e)(6) or 1026.43(f). In addition, the Bureau is amending an exemption from the requirement to establish escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans under &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) for small creditors that extend more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions secured by a first lien in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; counties during the preceding calendar year. To prevent creditors that qualified for the exemption in 2013 from losing eligibility in 2014 or 2015 because of changes in which counties are considered rural while the Bureau is re-evaluating the underlying definition of &#x201C;rural,&#x201D; the Bureau is amending this provision to allow creditors to qualify for the exemption if they extended more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions in rural or underserved counties in any of the previous three calendar years (assuming the other criteria for eligibility are also met).</P>

            <P>
              <SU>3</SU>78 FR 35430 (June 12, 2013).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Fourth, the Bureau is adopting revisions, as well as general technical and wording changes, to various provisions of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule in &#xA7; 1026.36. These include revising the definition of &#x201C;loan originator&#x201D; in the regulatory text and commentary, such as provisions addressing when employees of a creditor or loan originator in certain administrative or clerical roles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>tellers or greeters) may become &#x201C;loan originators&#x201D; and thus subject to the rule, upon providing contact information or credit applications for loan originators or creditors to consumers; further clarification on the meaning of &#x201C;credit terms,&#x201D; which is used throughout &#xA7; 1026.36(a); and additional clarifications regarding when employees of manufactured housing retailers may be classified as loan originators. The Bureau also is adopting a number of clarifications to the commentary on prohibited payments to loan originators.</P>
          <P>Fifth, the Bureau is clarifying and revising three aspects of the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act prohibition on creditors financing credit insurance premiums in connection with certain consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. The Bureau is adding new &#xA7; 1026.36(i)(2)(ii) to clarify what constitutes financing of such premiums by a creditor. The Bureau also is adding new &#xA7; 1026.36(i)(2)(iii) to clarify when credit insurance premiums are considered to be calculated and paid on a monthly basis, for purposes of the statutory exclusion from the prohibition for certain credit insurance premium calculation and payment arrangements. And, finally, the Bureau is adding new comment 36(i)-1 to clarify when including the credit insurance premium or fee in the amount owed violates the rule.</P>
          <P>Sixth, the Bureau is changing the effective date for certain provisions under the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, so they take effect on January 1, 2014, rather than January 10, 2014, as originally provided. The affected provisions are the amendments to or additions of (as applicable) &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) (record retention), &#xA7; 1026.36(a) (definitions), &#xA7; 1026.36(b) (scope), &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (compensation), &#xA7; 1026.36(e) (anti-steering), &#xA7; 1026.36(f) (qualifications), and &#xA7; 1026.36(j) (compliance policies and procedures for depository institutions) and the associated commentary. The Bureau believes that this change will facilitate compliance because these provisions largely focus on compensation plan structures, registration and licensing, and hiring and training requirements that are often structured on an annual basis and typically do not vary from transaction to transaction. After reviewing comments, the Bureau has decided to keep the date for implementation of the ban on financing credit insurance under &#xA7; 1026.36(i) as January 10, 2014, consistent with the date previously adopted in the Loan Originator Compensation Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z); Prohibition on Financing Credit Insurance Premiums; Delay of Effective Date (2013 Effective Date Final Rule).<SU>4</SU>

          <P>In addition to the clarifications and amendments to Regulations X and Z discussed above, the Bureau is adopting technical corrections and minor clarifications to wording throughout Regulations B, X, and Z that are generally not substantive in nature.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Title XIV Rules Under the Dodd-Frank Act</HD>
          <P>In response to an unprecedented cycle of expansion and contraction in the mortgage market that sparked the most severe U.S. recession since the Great Depression, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the Bureau and, under sections 1061 and 1100A, generally consolidated the rulemaking authority for Federal consumer financial laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), in the Bureau.<SU>5</SU>

            <FTREF/>At the same time, Congress significantly amended the statutory requirements governing mortgage practices with the intent to restrict the practices that contributed to and exacerbated the crisis. Under the statute, most of these new requirements would have taken effect automatically on January 21, 2013, if the Bureau had not issued implementing regulations by that<PRTPAGE P="60384"/>date.<SU>6</SU>
            <FTREF/>To avoid uncertainty and potential disruption in the national mortgage market at a time of economic vulnerability, the Bureau issued several final rules in a span of less than two weeks in January 2013 to implement these new statutory provisions and provide for an orderly transition.</P>

The Consumer Financial Protection Act is substantially codified at 12 U.S.C. 5481-5603. Section 1029 of the Dodd-Frank Act excludes from this transfer of authority, subject to certain exceptions, any rulemaking authority over a motor vehicle dealer that is predominantly engaged in the sale and servicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of motor vehicles, or both. 12 U.S.C. 5519.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>In the June 2013 proposal, the Bureau proposed amendments to its new mortgage rules. This final rule adopts those proposed amendments with some additional clarifications and revisions. The purpose of these updates is to address important questions raised by industry, consumer groups, or other agencies.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Comments on the Proposed Rule</HD>
          <P>The Bureau received 280 comments on the proposed rule on which the final rule is based. Many of these comments discussed issues on which the proposed rule did not seek comment or address. A number of comments addressed, for example, the small servicer exemption, the general effective dates for the 2013 Title XIV Rules finalized in January 2013, whether the Bureau should reconsider replacing the &#xA7; 1026.36(a) definition of &#x201C;loan originator&#x201D; with the definition provided under the SAFE Act, or whether the Bureau should amend the provision of the mortgage servicing rules that deals with second or successive loss mitigation applications. This final rule does not make any changes outside the scope of the proposal. As proposed, it focuses on specific, narrow implementation and interpretive issues, rather than broader policy changes.</P>
          <P>The Bureau has examined all comments submitted and discusses those that were responsive to the proposal in the section-by-section analysis below.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Legal Authority</HD>
          <P>The Bureau is issuing this final rule pursuant to its authority under ECOA, TILA, RESPA, and the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1061 of the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Bureau the &#x201C;consumer financial protection functions&#x201D; previously vested in certain other Federal agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). The term &#x201C;consumer financial protection function&#x201D; is defined to include &#x201C;all authority to prescribe rules or issue orders or guidelines pursuant to any Federal consumer financial law, including performing appropriate functions to promulgate and review such rules, orders, and guidelines.&#x201D;<SU>10</SU>

In addition, section 6(j)(3) of RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605(j)(3), authorizes the Bureau to establish any requirements necessary to carry out section 6 of RESPA, and section 6(k)(1)(E) of RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605(k)(1)(E), authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations that are appropriate to carry out RESPA's consumer protection purposes.

          <P>Section 105(a) of TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA. Under section 105(a), such regulations may contain such additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion<PRTPAGE P="60385"/>thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith. A purpose of TILA is &#x201C;to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.&#x201D; TILA section 102(a), 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). In particular, it is a purpose of TILA section 129C, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, and abusive. Section 105(f) of TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1604(f), authorizes the Bureau to exempt from all or part of TILA any class of transactions if the Bureau determines that TILA coverage does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. Under TILA section 103(bb)(4), the Bureau may adjust the definition of points and fees for purposes of that threshold to include such charges that the Bureau determines to be appropriate.</P>
          <P>TILA section 129C(b)(3)(B)(i) provides the Bureau with authority to prescribe regulations that revise, add to, or subtract from the criteria that define a qualified mortgage upon a finding that such regulations are necessary or proper to ensure that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with the purposes of the ability-to-repay requirements; or are necessary and appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the ability-to-repay requirements, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance with TILA sections 129B and 129C. 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(3)(B)(i). In addition, TILA section 129C(b)(3)(A) requires the Bureau to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the qualified mortgage provisions, such as to ensure that responsible and affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with the purposes of TILA section 129C. 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(3)(A).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. The Dodd-Frank Act</HD>
          <P>Section 1022(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules &#x201C;as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Bureau to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof.&#x201D; 12 U.S.C. 5512(b)(1). Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act is a Federal consumer financial law. Accordingly, the Bureau is exercising its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act section 1022(b) to prescribe rules that carry out the purposes and objectives of ECOA, RESPA, TILA, title X, and the enumerated subtitles and provisions of title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, and prevent evasion of those laws.</P>
          <P>Section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Bureau &#x201C;may prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances.&#x201D; 12 U.S.C. 5532(a). The authority granted to the Bureau in Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a) is broad, and empowers the Bureau to prescribe rules regarding the disclosure of the &#x201C;features&#x201D; of consumer financial products and services generally. Accordingly, the Bureau may prescribe rules containing disclosure requirements even if other Federal consumer financial laws do not specifically require disclosure of such features.</P>
          <P>Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(c) provides that, in prescribing rules pursuant to Dodd-Frank Act section 1032, the Bureau &#x201C;shall consider available evidence about consumer awareness, understanding of, and responses to disclosures or communications about the risks, costs, and benefits of consumer financial products or services.&#x201D; 12 U.S.C. 5532(c). Accordingly, in amending provisions authorized under Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), the Bureau has considered available studies, reports, and other evidence about consumer awareness, understanding of, and responses to disclosures or communications about the risks, costs, and benefits of consumer financial products or services.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is amending rules finalized in January 2013 that implement certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions.

          <P>In enacting the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress significantly amended the statutory requirements governing a number of mortgage practices.

            <FTREF/>The Bureau issued the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules in January 2013 to implement these new statutory provisions and provide for an orderly transition. To allow the mortgage industry sufficient time to comply with the new rules, the Bureau established January 10, 2014&#x2014;one year after issuance of the earliest of the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules&#x2014;as the baseline effective date for nearly all of the new requirements. In the preamble to certain of the various 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, the Bureau further specified that the new regulations would apply to transactions for which applications were received on or after January 10, 2014.</P>

          </FTNT>

          <P>Except for the amendments regarding the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule and the 2013 Escrows Final Rule discussed below, the Bureau proposed an effective date of January 10, 2014. The Bureau proposed this effective date because it is consistent with the effective dates for the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, which this final rule clarifies, revises, or amends. Most of the proposed amendments were intended to clarify application of certain aspects of these rules in advance of the January 10, 2014 effective date, or amend them in manners that facilitate compliance. As discussed in the various 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, the Bureau believes that having a consistent effective date across most of the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules will facilitate compliance. This includes any clarifications, revisions, or other amendments made during the implementation period&#x2014;particularly those amendments designed to facilitate compliance with the overarching 2013 Title XIV Final Rules. Thus, because the clarifications, revisions, and amendments to the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules adopted in this final rule interrelate with or depend on other aspects of the underlying 2013 Title XIV Final Rules and are intended largely to facilitate compliance with those rules,<PRTPAGE P="60386"/>the Bureau does not believe that the amendments adopted by this final rule should become effective on a different date than the underlying regulations. The Bureau thus proposed an effective date of January 10, 2014 for any amendments adopted by this final rule.</P>
          <P>The Bureau received some comments from industry and trade associations that addressed the effective dates, but most of these comments generally requested a delayed effective date across all the rules, which the Bureau did not propose. The Bureau received a handful of comments that asked for staggered effective dates for the amended rules, but none of these comments provided a reasonable means of implementing the proposed amendments at a date later than the underlying regulations the proposal would have amended. Despite these comments, the Bureau remains persuaded that it would be impracticable for these amendments to take effect later than the underlying regulations they amend. Moreover, the Bureau believes that these amendments should help industry participants comply with the other components of the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, which in most cases also will take effect January 10, 2014. The Bureau thus is adopting the effective date of January 10, 2014, for the amendments in this document other than as discussed in parts IV.B and IV.C below.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. For Provisions Related to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule</HD>

          <P>The Bureau proposed an effective date of January 1, 2014 for the amendments to the new provisions in &#xA7; 1026.35 that govern higher-priced mortgage loan escrow requirements, which took effect on June 1, 2013. While the Bureau established January 10, 2014 as the baseline effective date for most of the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, it identified certain provisions that it believed did not present significant implementation burdens for industry, including amendments to &#xA7; 1026.35 adopted by the 2013 Escrows Final Rule. For these provisions, the Bureau set an earlier effective date of June 1, 2013. The proposal would have amended one such provision, &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), which provides an exemption from the higher-priced mortgage loan escrow requirement to creditors that extend more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions secured by a first lien in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; counties during the preceding calendar year and also meet other small creditor criteria, and do not otherwise maintain escrow accounts for loans serviced by themselves or an affiliate. In light of recent changes to which counties meet the definition of &#x201C;rural,&#x201D; the Bureau proposed to amend this provision to prevent creditors that qualified for the exemption in 2013 from losing eligibility in 2014 or 2015 because of these changes. The proposal would have allowed creditors to qualify for the exemption if they qualified in any of the previous three calendar years (assuming the other criteria for eligibility are also met). In addition, the proposal would have amended &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) to prevent creditors that were previously ineligible for the exemption, but may now qualify in light of the proposed changes, from losing eligibility because they had established escrow accounts for first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans (for which applications were received after June 1, 2013), as required when the final rule took effect and prior to the proposed amendments taking effect. The Bureau proposed to make this amendment effective for applications received on or after January 1, 2014, because the &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) exemption applies based on a calendar year and relates to a regulation that is already in effect. The Bureau received no comments addressing the proposed effective date of this provision, other than comments that generally supported the proposal.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis below, the Bureau is adopting amendments to &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) as proposed. In addition, the Bureau is adopting amendments to the commentary to this section substantially as proposed with one additional clarification. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to set a January 1, 2014 effective date for these provisions. The Bureau notes that a January 1, 2014 effective date is more beneficial to industry, because the amendment would only expand eligibility for the exemption&#x2014;thus an effective date of January 1, 2014, as opposed to January 10, 2014, would mean that creditors are able to take advantage of this expanded exemption earlier. Accordingly, the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and its commentary will apply to applications received on or after January 1, 2014.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Proposal</HD>
          <P>As described in the proposal, the Bureau established January 10, 2014, as the baseline effective date for nearly all of the provisions in the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, including most provisions of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. In the proposal, the Bureau stated that it believed that having a consistent effective date across nearly all of the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules would facilitate compliance. However, as explained in the proposal, the Bureau identified a few provisions that it believed did not present significant implementation burdens for industry, including &#xA7; 1026.36(h) on mandatory arbitration clauses and waivers of certain consumer rights and &#xA7; 1026.36(i) on financing credit insurance, as adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. As explained in the proposal, for these provisions (and associated commentary), the Bureau set an earlier effective date of June 1, 2013.<SU>15</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>15</SU>After interpretive issues were raised concerning the credit insurance provision as discussed in the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, the Bureau temporarily delayed and extended the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(i) in the 2013 Effective Date Final Rule until January 10, 2014. 78 FR 32547 (May 31, 2013). In the proposal, the Bureau requested comment on whether the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(i) may be set earlier than January 10, 2014.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>As described in the proposal, since issuing the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule in January 2013, the Bureau has received a number of questions about transition issues, particularly with regard to application of provisions under &#xA7; 1026.36(d) that generally prohibit basing loan originator compensation on transaction terms but permit creditors to award non-deferred profits-based compensation subject to certain limits. For instance, as discussed in the proposal, the Bureau has received inquiries about when creditors and loan originator organizations may begin taking into account transactions for purposes of paying compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan pursuant to &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the 10-percent total compensation limit, or the 10-percent limit). As the Bureau stated in the proposal, while the profits-based compensation provisions present relatively complicated transition issues, the Bureau is also conscious of the fact that most other provisions in the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final<PRTPAGE P="60387"/>Rule are simpler to implement because they largely recodify and clarify existing requirements that were previously adopted by the Federal Reserve Board in 2010 with regard to loan originator compensation, and by various agencies under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, 12 U.S.C. 5106-5116 (SAFE Act), with regard to loan originator qualification requirements. The Bureau also stated in the proposal that these provisions are focused on compensation plan structures, registration and licensing, and hiring and training requirements that are often structured on an annual basis and typically do not vary from transaction to transaction.</P>
          <P>For all of these reasons, the Bureau proposed moving the general effective date for most provisions adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule to January 1, 2014. The Bureau stated in the proposal that, although this change would shorten the implementation period by nine days, the Bureau believes that the change would actually facilitate compliance and reduce implementation burden by providing a cleaner transition period that more closely aligns with changes to employers' annual compensation structures and registration, licensing, and training requirements. In addition, the Bureau also stated that, because elements of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule concerning retention of records, definitions, scope, and implementing procedures affect multiple provisions, the Bureau was proposing to make the change with regard to the bulk of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule as described further below, rather than attempting to treat individual provisions in isolation. Finally, the Bureau also proposed changes to the effective date for provisions on financing of credit insurance under &#xA7; 1026.36(i), in connection with proposing further clarifications and guidance on the Dodd-Frank Act requirements related to that provision.</P>
          <P>The Bureau stated in the proposal that it believed these changes would facilitate compliance and help ensure that the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule does not have adverse unintended consequences. The Bureau requested public comment on these proposed effective dates, including on any suggested alternatives.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Comments</HD>
          <P>The Bureau received approximately 30 comments addressing the proposed changes to the effective date for the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule other than &#xA7; 1026.36(i).<SU>16</SU>

            <FTREF/>The comments generally were supportive of these proposed changes. A national association of credit unions and several state credit union associations supported moving up the effective date from January 10, 2014, to January 1, 2014, stating that a January 1 date would result in a cleaner transition period that more closely aligns with changes to employers' annual compensation structures and registration, licensing, and training requirements. A national trade association of banking institutions stated its appreciation for the Bureau's efforts to facilitate compliance and establish effective dates that are better aligned with banker systems. This association wrote that it did not believe a January 1 effective date would constitute a major burden. The association urged the Bureau, however, to enact effective dates that apply to transactions that are<E T="03">either</E>consummated on or after January 1, 2014<E T="03">or</E>for which the creditor paid compensation on or after that date. According to the association, allowing for an alternative option would best accommodate the various payment systems and methods that exist across various institutions and would not, in its opinion, give rise to significant difficulties in terms of examinations.<SU>17</SU>

          <P>One community bank commented that it would pose unnecessary and wasteful burdens on financial institutions of all sizes to necessitate a separate accounting and reporting for a nine-day period, because accounting periods for compensation generally commence annually each January 1st. A large mortgage company stated that it supported the change because moving the effective date to January 1, 2014, would help lenders update their systems on a consistent basis and avoid any potential lapses in accounting or confusion that could emerge between January 1 and January 10. One community bank stated that it is &#x201C;operationally efficient&#x201D; to apply rule changes at the beginning of a month and that there would be no real difference in compliance burden because &#x201C;most lenders would naturally&#x201D; comply as of the earlier date anyway. A state association representing banking institutions wrote that moving up the effective date by nine days aligns more closely with payroll records and tax reporting and may actually be easier to implement from an operational basis than a January 10 effective date. This association did report that its members have indicated that they will not be able to meet either a January 1 or a January 10, 2014, effective date due to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule's complexity and pending amendments.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Final Rule</HD>
          <P>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is finalizing the effective dates for &#xA7; 1026.36 (and interrelated provisions in &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2)) adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule (and associated commentary), and the amendments to and additions to those sections contained in today's final rule, as proposed. The Bureau discusses in turn below the effective dates for different provisions of &#xA7; 1026.36 (and interrelated provisions in &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2)). These clarifications and amendments to the effective date require only minimal revisions to the rule text and commentary and primarily are reflected in the Dates caption and discussion of effective dates in this Supplementary Information. As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), directs the Bureau to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA, and provides that such regulations may contain additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, that the Bureau judges are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance. Under Dodd-Frank Act section 1022(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 5512(b)(1), the Bureau has general authority to prescribe rules as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Bureau to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof. The Bureau is changing the effective date of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule with respect to those provisions described above pursuant to its TILA section 105(a) and Dodd-Frank Act section 1022(b)(1) authority.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Effective Date for Amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d)</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Proposal</HD>

          <P>The Bureau proposed three specific changes to the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (and associated commentary) contained in<PRTPAGE P="60388"/>the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. First, the Bureau proposed that the provisions of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule revising &#xA7; 1026.36(d) would be effective January 1, 2014, not January 10, 2014. The Bureau discussed its concern that an effective date of January 10, 2014, for the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) may result in creditors and loan originator organizations believing that they have to account separately for the period from January 1 through January 9, 2014, when applying the new compensation restrictions under &#xA7; 1026.36(d). While recognizing that this proposal would mean that creditors and loan originator organizations would have a slightly shorter implementation period, the Bureau stated that on balance it believed the proposed change would have eased compliance burdens for creditors and loan originator organizations by eliminating any concern about a need for separate accountings as described above. As noted above, the Bureau also proposed to change the effective date for the addition of &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) (records retention) (and associated commentary) from January 10, 2014, to January 1, 2014, to dovetail with the proposal to change the effective date of &#xA7; 1026.36(d) to January 1, 2014, to ensure that records on compensation paid between January 1 and January 10, 2014, are properly maintained.</P>
          <P>Second, the Bureau proposed that the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (other than the addition of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii), as discussed below) would have applied to transactions that are consummated and for which the creditor or loan originator organization paid compensation on or after January 1, 2014. The Bureau stated its belief that applying the effective date for the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) based on application receipt, rather than based on transaction consummation and compensation payment, could present compliance challenges. This proposed change, as the Bureau discussed in the proposal, would have permitted transactions to be taken into account for purposes of compensating individual loan originators under the exceptions set forth in &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) if the transactions were consummated and compensation was paid to the individual loan originator on or after January 1, 2014, even if the applications for those transactions were received prior to January 1, 2014. The Bureau stated that it believes this clarification, in conjunction with the proposed change to the effective date for the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) described above, would have reduced compliance burdens on creditors and loan originator organizations by allowing them to take into account all transactions consummated in 2014 (and for which compensation is paid to individual loan originators in 2014) for purposes of paying compensation under &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) that is earned in 2014. This proposed revision also would have allowed the consumer-paid compensation restrictions and exceptions thereto in the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(2) to be effective upon the consummation of any transaction where such compensation is paid in 2014 even if the application for that transaction was received in 2013.</P>
          <P>Third, the Bureau proposed that the provisions of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii), which pertain to contributions to or benefits under designated tax-advantaged plans for individual loan originators, would apply to transactions for which the creditor or loan originator organization paid compensation on or after January 1, 2014, regardless of when the transactions were consummated or the applications were received. The Bureau explained in the proposal that these changes regarding the effective date for the revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) would have more clearly reflected the Bureau's intent to permit payment of compensation related to designated tax-advantaged plans during both 2013 (as explained in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 clarifying current &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1))<SU>18</SU>
            <FTREF/>and thereafter (under the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>18</SU>The Bureau explained in the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule that it issued CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 (the Bulletin) to address questions regarding the application of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1) to &#x201C;Qualified Plans&#x201D; (as defined in the Bulletin). The Bureau noted in that Supplementary Information that until the final rule takes effect, the clarifications in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 remain in effect. Moreover, as the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau interprets &#x201C;Qualified Plan&#x201D; as used in the Bulletin to include the designated tax-advantaged plans described in the final rule.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In addition to the three specific changes to the effective date described above, the Bureau solicited comment generally on whether the proposed changes to the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) are appropriate or whether other approaches should be considered. In particular, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) should take effect on January 1, 2014, and apply to all payments of compensation made on or after that date, regardless of the date of consummation of the transactions on whose terms the compensation was based.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Comments</HD>
          <P>Industry commenters generally supported the proposed changes to the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) that were added by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. There were no objections to the Bureau's proposal to delete application receipt as the triggering event for the effective date provisions of &#xA7; 1026.36 (other than for &#xA7; 1026.36(g)). One state trade association of banking institutions wrote that applying the effective date for revisions to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) based on receipt of applications would create &#x201C;serious compliance and recordkeeping challenges.&#x201D; Moreover, industry commenters generally supported the shift of the effective date for the amendments of &#xA7; 1026.36(d) from January 10 to January 1, 2014 (see discussion above with regard to the general comments the Bureau received on the changes to the effective dates for the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule). Industry commenters also did not raise any objections to the proposed revisions to the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii), which would have applied to transactions for which compensation is paid on or after January 1, 2014, without regard to when the transactions were consummated. Nor did industry commenters specifically object to the proposal to change the effective date for the addition of &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) (records retention) from January 10, 2014, to January 1, 2014.</P>

          <P>Several commenters expressly supported the Bureau's proposal to apply the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (other than the addition of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)) to transactions consummated on or after January 1, 2014,<E T="03">and</E>where compensation was paid on or after January 1, 2014. A large depository institution wrote that this approach to the effective date would be a &#x201C;welcome clarification.&#x201D; One industry commenter that specializes in the financing of manufactured housing, in expressing support for proposed changes to the effective date, objected to the alternative on which the Bureau solicited comment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>that the effective date would apply to compensation paid on or after January 1, 2014, regardless of the date of consummation of the transaction).<SU>19</SU>

              <SU>19</SU>This commenter noted its agreement with the Bureau's statement in the proposal that such an approach could raise complexity about how the new rule would apply to payments under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans made on or after January 1, 2014, where the compensation payments were based on the terms of transactions consummated in 2013. This commenter wrote that such an approach would adversely affect, without<PRTPAGE/>fair warning, those creditors and their employees for whom 2013 compensation plans were made in mid-2012.</P>

          <P>A small number of industry commenters asked that the Bureau provide more flexibility as to the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d). As noted above, one national trade association asked that the effective dates for the various provisions of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule be triggered<E T="03">either</E>by the consummation of transactions on or after January 1, 2014,<E T="03">or</E>by the payment of compensation on or after January 1, 2014, with the complying parties having the option of selecting the applicable triggering event. A state association representing banking institutions similarly asked for an &#x201C;either/or&#x201D; approach with regard to the proposed trigger for the effective date. A state association representing banking institutions stated that the proposed formula for the effective date (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>considering both the consummation date and the payment date) was unnecessarily complex, and instead recommended that the effective date be tied solely to the payment date. A national trade association of mortgage banking institutions and a mortgage company recommended that the Bureau adopt January 1, 2014, as an optional effective date, with mandatory implementation as of January 10, 2014. The association reasoned that while the earlier effective date may benefit many lenders, there may be some lenders that have already arranged compliance for the later date and would be forced to incur additional expense if compliance were required earlier. The mortgage company stated this change might assist in a small way in regards to payroll systems.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Final Rule</HD>

          <P>The Bureau is finalizing the effective date and applicability for the amendments to &#xA7;&#xA7; 1026.36(d) and 1026.25(c)(2) (and associated commentary) adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule and the proposed amendments and additions thereto in the June 2013 proposal, as proposed. That is: (1) The amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (other than the addition of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)) and the provisions of &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) will apply to transactions that are consummated and for which the creditor or loan originator organization paid compensation on or after January 1, 2014; and (2) the provisions of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) will apply to transactions for which the creditor or loan originator organization paid compensation on or after January 1, 2014, regardless of when the transactions were consummated or their applications were received. For the reasons stated in the proposal and supported by many of the commenters, the Bureau believes that a January 1, 2014, effective date will ease compliance burden by aligning the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) with the date on which annual changes to compensation policies are implemented. Moreover, the Bureau believes that tying the application of the effective date for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) (other than the addition of &#xA7;&#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) and 1026.25(c)(2)) to conjunctive triggering events on or after January 1, 2014 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the consummation of transactions<E T="03">and</E>the payment of compensation based on the terms of those transactions) best facilitates a smooth transition from one set of compensation rules to another. The Bureau thus disagrees with the commenters that asked for an &#x201C;either/or&#x201D; approach (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>tied to either the consummation date or the payment date) or for the effective date to be tied only to payment of compensation. A rule where the complying party has the option of choosing among two possible triggering events potentially would create confusion for complying parties and examiners about whether compensation earned in 2013 but paid in 2014 is subject to the current compensation rules under &#xA7; 1026.36(d) or the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) added by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, and as to whether the amended recordkeeping requirements in &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) would apply. Moreover, as one commenter suggested, permitting creditors and loan originator organizations to pay, in 2014, compensation earned in 2013&#x2014;at which time the current compensation rules were still in effect&#x2014;might disadvantage creditors or loan originator organizations that relied on the current rules in setting up their 2013 compensation programs in 2012.</P>
          <P>The Bureau also believes that providing for an optional compliance date of January 1, 2014&#x2014;as suggested by a small number of industry commenters&#x2014;would add complexity which would likely outweigh the benefits of the flexibility that some complying parties might gain from this approach. The Bureau is concerned that this approach to the effective date would lead to unnecessary dispersion of compliance dates over a ten-day period in early 2014, which in turn would be difficult to track by examiners and enforcing parties, and potentially raise other legal and operational questions. It could potentially lead to gaps in recordkeeping as well. Even further confusion could result due to the continued effect of the current compensation rules for an additional nine-day period. The Bureau also notes that the weight of comments it received on the proposed effective date changes supported a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2014.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Proposal</HD>
          <P>Rather than implementing the proposed change in effective dates for &#xA7; 1026.36(d) in isolation, the Bureau also proposed to make the amendments to or additions of (as applicable) &#xA7; 1026.36(a) (definitions), &#xA7; 1026.36(b) (scope), &#xA7; 1026.36(e) (anti-steering), &#xA7; 1026.36(f) (qualifications) and &#xA7; 1026.36(j) (compliance policies and procedures for depository institutions) (and associated commentary) contained in the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule take effect on January 1, 2014. The Bureau proposed not to tie the effective date to the receipt of a particular loan application, but rather to a date certain. Because these provisions rely on a common set of definitions and in some cases cross-reference each other,<SU>20</SU>
            <FTREF/>the Bureau proposed to make them effective on January 1, 2014, and without reference to receipt of applications to avoid a potential incongruity among the effective dates of the substantive provisions and the effective dates of the regulatory definitions and scope provisions supporting those substantive provisions. In the proposal, the Bureau stated that it believes this proposed approach would facilitate compliance.</P>

          </FTNT>

          <P>The Bureau did not, however, propose to adjust the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(g) (and associated commentary), which requires that loan originators' names and identifier numbers be provided on certain loan documentation, except to clarify and confirm that the provision takes effect with regard to any application received on or after January 10, 2014, by a creditor or a loan originator organization. Because this provision requires modifications to documentation for individual loans and the systems that generate such documentation, the Bureau stated in the<PRTPAGE P="60390"/>proposal that it believes it is appropriate to have this provision take effect with the other 2013 Title XIV Final Rules that affect individual loan processing.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Comments</HD>
          <P>As noted above, the commenters that addressed the proposed changes to the effective dates for the provisions of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule generally expressed support for the proposed changes. In nearly all cases, these comments did not discuss the application of the effective date to specific provisions within &#xA7; 1026.36, other than the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d). One national trade association that requested an optional compliance date of January 1, 2014, for the amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(d) noted that, if the Bureau were to adopt a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2014, it nonetheless agreed with the proposal to keep the effective date for the provisions of &#xA7; 1026.36(g) as January 10, 2014. The association stated that systems changes to revise loan documents scheduled to take effect on January 10 should not be made costlier or less convenient as a result of the Bureau's changes to the effective date provisions.</P>

Therefore: (1) The effective date for the amendments to or additions of &#xA7; 1026.36(a), (b), (e), (f), and (j) as finalized in this rule will be January 1, 2014 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a date certain that is not tied to a triggering event, such as receipt of an application on or after that date); and (2) the effective date for the addition of &#xA7; 1026.36(g) will be January 10, 2014, and that section therefore will apply to all transactions for which the creditor or loan originator organization received an application on or after that date.<SU>21</SU>

              <SU>21</SU>While a depository institution must have its policies and procedures under &#xA7; 1026.36(j) in place by January 1, 2014, including policies and procedures covering &#xA7; 1026.36(g), the depository institution is, of course, not required to ensure and monitor compliance with &#xA7; 1026.36(g) until January 10, 2014, the effective date of &#xA7; 1026.36(g).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>While the Bureau is not changing the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(g), it has become aware that some uncertainty exists with respect to the application of this provision where more than one loan originator organization is involved in originating the same transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a mortgage broker and a creditor performing origination services with respect to the same transaction). The Bureau understands that some loan originator organizations are planning to comply by including the name and Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR) ID (where the NMLSR has provided one) for<E T="03">multiple</E>loan originator organizations involved in originating the transaction on the loan documents, while others are planning to comply by including the name and NMLSR ID (where the NMLSR has provided one) for just<E T="03">one</E>of the loan originator organizations involved in originating the transaction on the loan documents. The Bureau believes that either approach complies with the rule in its current form. However, the Bureau is considering proposing to clarify at some point in the future that the name and NMLSR ID (where the NMLSR has provided one) for<E T="03">multiple</E>loan originator organizations involved in originating the transaction must be included on the loan documents. If the Bureau ultimately adopts such a clarification, it will provide adequate time for compliance.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Effective Date for &#xA7; 1026.36(i)</HD>
          <P>As discussed in the 2013 Effective Date Final Rule and below, the Bureau initially adopted a June 1, 2013 effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(i), but later delayed the provision's effective date to January 10, 2014, while the Bureau considered addressing interpretive questions concerning the provision's applicability to transactions other than those in which a lump-sum premium is added to the loan amount at consummation. The Bureau sought comment on whether the January 10, 2014 effective date would be appropriate in light of the proposed changes, or whether an earlier effective date could be set that permits sufficient time for creditors to adjust their insurance premium practices as necessary. The Bureau received comments from trade associations, the credit insurance industry, credit unions and other financial institutions, as well as consumer groups, which addressed the proposed effective date. Industry commenters and trade associations strongly preferred the January 10th date to an earlier date, and stated that system adjustments will be required to implement the final rule. However, these commenters generally supported the January 10, 2014 effective date as reasonable, so long as the final rule does not materially differ from the proposal. Consumer groups suggested that the Bureau set the effective date at January 1, 2014, noting that the consumer benefit derived from the provision has already been delayed from its original effective date of June 1, 2013.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis below, the Bureau is adopting amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(i) substantially as proposed, with some additional clarifications. The Bureau believes that creditors will need time to adjust certain credit insurance premium billing practices to account for the final rule, but believes that the January 10, 2014 effective date adopted in the 2013 Effective Date Final Rule will allow sufficient time for compliance. This approach is consistent with comments from industry and trade associations, as well as the generally applicable effective date for the 2013 Title XIV Final Rules, including for several provisions the Bureau is amending through this notice.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Proposal</HD>

          <P>The Bureau proposed to amend commentary to &#xA7; 1002.14 to clarify the definition of &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; as adopted by the 2013 ECOA Final Rule. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Dodd-Frank Act section 1474 amended ECOA by, among other things, defining &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; to include any<E T="03">estimate</E>of the value of the dwelling developed in connection with a creditor's decisions to provide credit.<E T="03">See</E>ECOA section 701(e)(6). Similarly, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule adopted &#xA7; 1002.14(b)(3), which defines &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; as any<E T="03">estimate</E>of the value of a dwelling developed in connection with an application for credit. Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau intended the term &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; to refer only to an estimate for purposes of the 2013 ECOA Final Rule's newly adopted provisions. However, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule added two comments that refer to a valuation as an appraiser's estimate or opinion of the value of the property: comment 14(b)(3)-1.i, which gives examples of &#x201C;valuations,&#x201D; as defined by &#xA7; 1002.14(b)(3); and comment 14(b)(3)-3.v, which provides examples of documents that discuss or restate a valuation of an applicant's property but nevertheless do not constitute &#x201C;valuations&#x201D; under &#xA7; 1002.14(b)(3).</P>

          <P>Because the Bureau did not intend by these two comments to alter the meaning of &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; to become inconsistent with ECOA section 701(e)(6) and &#xA7; 1002.14(b)(3), the Bureau<PRTPAGE P="60391"/>proposed to clarify comments 14(b)(3)-1.i and 14(b)(3)-3.v by removing the words &#x201C;or opinion&#x201D; from their texts, and sought comment on the clarification.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Comments</HD>
          <P>The Bureau received a few comments from trade associations and credit unions that generally supported the clarification. The Bureau also received one comment from a trade association that suggested the proposed change could cause additional confusion, because the term &#x201C;opinion of value&#x201D; is commonly used to describe appraisals. This commenter also pointed out that appraisals are generally not considered to be &#x201C;estimates,&#x201D; and thus the application of the rule to appraisals could be confusing in light of the proposed change. The commenter suggested that, rather than deleting the word &#x201C;opinion&#x201D; altogether, the Bureau instead clarify that a valuation includes any &#x201C;estimate or opinion of value.&#x201D;</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Final Rule</HD>
          <P>The Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(3)-1.i as proposed with some additional modifications, and also is adding new comment 14(b)(3)-3.vi based on the trade association comment. In proposing these amendments, the Bureau intended to clarify that the comments referred to appraisals or other valuation models by removing the word &#x201C;opinion,&#x201D; which could be read broadly to include even speculative opinions not based on an appraisal or other valuation model. However, in light of the trade association's comments the Bureau believes that simply deleting the word &#x201C;opinion&#x201D; could also cause confusion regarding whether and how the rule applies to appraisals that are commonly described as &#x201C;opinions of value.&#x201D; Thus, the Bureau is substituting &#x201C;opinion of value&#x201D; for &#x201C;opinion&#x201D; rather than deleting the word entirely. The Bureau is adopting revised comment 14(b)(3)-1.i with this change. The Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(3)-3.v as proposed, and does not believe any additional revisions are necessary in light of this clarification, because the comment deals exclusively with reports reflecting property inspections and not appraisals. However, the Bureau is adding new comment 14(b)(3)-3.vi to clarify that appraisal reviews that do not provide an estimate of value or &#x201C;opinion of value&#x201D; are included in the list of examples of items that are not considered &#x201C;valuations&#x201D; for purposes of &#xA7; 1002.14(b)(3).</P>

            <FTREF/>In addition, the Bureau has consulted, or offered to consult with, the prudential regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, HUD, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of the Treasury, including regarding consistency with any prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>52</SU>Specifically, section 1022(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act calls for the Bureau to consider the potential benefits and costs of a regulation to consumers and covered persons, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services; the impact on depository institutions and credit unions with $10 billion or less in total assets as described in section 1026 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and the impact on consumers in rural areas.</P>

          <P>The Bureau notes that for some analyses, there are limited data available with which to quantify the potential costs, benefits and impacts of this final rule. In particular, the Bureau did not receive comments specifically addressing the Section 1022 analysis in the proposed rule. Still, general economic principles as well as the information and analysis on which the January rules were based provide insight into the benefits, costs and impacts and where relevant, the analysis provides a qualitative discussion of the benefits, cost and impacts of the final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Potential Benefits and Costs to Consumers and Covered Persons</HD>
          <P>The Bureau believes that, compared to the baseline established by the final rules issued in January 2013,<SU>54</SU>
            <FTREF/>an important benefit of most of the provisions of this final rule to both consumers and covered persons is an increase in clarity and precision of the regulations and an accompanying reduction in compliance costs. Other benefits and costs are considered below.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>54</SU>The Bureau has discretion in any rulemaking to choose an appropriate scope of analysis with respect to potential benefits and costs and an appropriate baseline.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>As described above, the Bureau is amending the commentary to &#xA7; 1024.35(c) and &#xA7; 1024.36(b). As adopted by the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Rules, these provisions and accompanying commentary require a servicer that has established an exclusive address at which it will receive communications pursuant to &#xA7; 1024.35 and &#xA7; 1024.36 to disclose that address whenever it provides a borrower any contact information for assistance from the servicer. The Bureau is amending the commentary so that the exclusive address need be provided on the written notice that designates the specific address; the periodic statement or coupon book required pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41; any Web site the servicer maintains in connection with the servicing of the loan; and any notice required pursuant to &#xA7;&#xA7; 1024.39 or .41 that includes contact information for assistance.</P>
          <P>These amendments reduce the costs to servicers of complying with &#xA7; 1024.35(c) and &#xA7; 1024.36(b) of the final rule by reducing the number of documents and other sources of information that must be modified to include the designated address. The Bureau believes that these amendments will cause at most a minimal reduction in the benefits to consumers. A borrower looking for the address to which to send a notice of error or a request for information would likely consult the servicer's Web site, the borrower's statement or coupon book, any loss mitigation documents, or perhaps the written notice designating the specific address. Further, servicers have an obligation, established by the January rule, to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers of the procedures for submitting written notices of error and written information requests. Thus, a servicer should provide the proper address to a borrower who contacts the servicer for the address to which to send a notice of error or a request for information. In light of these two parallel requirements, the Bureau believes borrowers will still have ready access to the exclusive address and are not likely to send a notice of error or a request for information to an improper address. Alternatives that would require the designated address on even fewer documents or communications would further reduce the compliance costs to servicers but would increase the risk that borrowers who wish to send a notice of error or a request for information would consult a document that did not include the exclusive address and would misroute their notice or request accordingly.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is amending &#xA7; 1024.35(g)(1)(iii)(B) (untimely notices of error) and &#xA7; 1024.36(f)(1)(v)(B) (untimely requests for information), which, as adopted in January, provided respectively that the notice or request is untimely if it is delivered to the servicer more than one year after a mortgage loan balance was paid in full. Under the amended provisions, the one-year period designated by these requirements will begin when a mortgage loan is discharged, such as through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, even if the loan balance was not paid in full.</P>

          <P>These amendments reduce costs to servicers by increasing the number of situations in which a notice or request is untimely and servicers are therefore not required to comply with certain requirements of &#xA7; 1024.35 or &#xA7; 1024.36. To the extent servicers no longer respond to notices or requests that are untimely because of these amendments, the lack of a response may impose some cost to consumers. The Bureau does not have data on the frequency with which borrowers with a mortgage that is terminated without being paid in full also assert an error or request information (within the scope of these requirements) more than one year after such termination, nor does the Bureau have information on the subsequent outcomes for such borrowers. However, the Bureau believes that one year after a mortgage loan is discharged generally provides sufficient time for borrowers to assert errors or request information. Consequently, an inability to obtain a response to such a notice or request during the longer period the rule prescribed before these amendments<PRTPAGE P="60433"/>would constitute at most a minimal impact on the benefits to consumers.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is amending the commentary to &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(2)(i) and adding new &#xA7; 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) to address the situation in which a servicer determines that additional information from the borrower is needed to complete an evaluation of a loss mitigation application after the servicer has informed the borrower, via the notice pursuant to &#xA7; 1026.41(b)(2)(i)(B), that the loss mitigation application is complete or the borrower provided the particular information identified as missing in an original notice. In summary, the servicer must request the additional information and provide a reasonable time for the borrower to respond. If the borrower provides the additional information, the 30-day evaluation period within which to evaluate the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower begins as of the date the borrower provides the remaining information. The borrower, on the other hand, receives the protections against foreclosure during the period provided to gather the supplemental information. If the borrower provides the additional information, the borrower will also receive the right to appeal and other rights as though the application were actually complete when either the borrower submitted the original loss mitigation application (if the notice informed the borrower that the application was complete) or the borrower provided the particular information identified in the original notice (if the notice informed the borrower that the application was incomplete). In situations in which a servicer determines that supplemental information from the borrower is needed after sending the &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, these dates will generally be earlier than the date on which the borrower provides the supplemental information to make the application complete. Accordingly, the amended final rule provides greater consumer protections than the original final rule or the proposal.</P>
          <P>The costs to the servicer of these amendments are the costs of complying that are incremental to the baseline costs arising from the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules. The Bureau believes that in all cases these costs are small given other provisions of the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules. As discussed above, under that final rule, servicers are required to review a loss mitigation application to determine whether it is complete or incomplete, to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objectives of identifying documents and information that a borrower is required to submit to complete an otherwise incomplete loss mitigation application, and to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete an incomplete application. Thus, the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules already obligated the servicer to exercise reasonable diligence to bring to completion an application that was facially complete but in fact lacked information necessary for review. The servicer would therefore, even absent the new provisions, have the personnel and infrastructure needed to contact the borrower for additional information and evaluate the application since these are required to comply with the other obligations stated above. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that the costs of complying with the amendment are significant.</P>
          <P>The benefits to consumers of these amendments are the benefits of servicers following the procedures adopted by this final rule that are incremental to the baseline benefits defined by the final servicing rule. The amendment requires servicers to promptly request any additional information or documents needed to complete a facially complete loss mitigation application, and also provides borrowers with a reasonable amount of time to provide any such documents or information. The amendment delays the 30-day period during which a servicer must evaluate a complete application until after the borrower has provided such documents or information. This additional time benefits consumers by encouraging thorough review of these applications. Further, the rule will make clear that a servicer has fulfilled its obligations if it follows the new procedure. This encourages servicers to acknowledge and rectify their errors and therefore increases the likelihood that servicers will make loss mitigation decisions on the basis of complete information.</P>
          <P>As an alternative, if borrowers receive protections from the date on which the application is actually complete (instead of facially complete), it is more likely the date would be past the 120th day of delinquency or closer to the date of a foreclosure sale. Servicers might have slightly lower costs under this alternative, perhaps from a shorter period of providing continuity of contact and monitoring the property, but borrowers would receive fewer protections against foreclosure. Further, servicers that wanted to provide fewer protections could more easily manipulate the date on which an application is actually complete than the date on which it is facially complete given that facial completeness is determined by a mandated timeline and disclosure and by how quickly the consumer provides any missing information identified in the disclosure.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is amending the &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) time period disclosure requirement, which requires a servicer to provide a date by which a borrower should submit any missing documents and information necessary to make a loss mitigation application complete. As explained above, &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) as originally adopted requires the servicer to notify the borrower that the borrower should submit such missing documents and information by the earliest of certain dates. This requirement would have applied even if the nearest date would leave the borrower with very little time to assemble the missing information. The amendment requires the servicer to provide a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the documents and information necessary to make the loss mitigation application complete. Commentary provides additional guidance and advises a servicer to select the nearest of four key dates that is at least seven days in the future. This change presents some tradeoff in benefits and costs for consumers, but on balance the Bureau believes that it will be beneficial to consumers. Consumers who would have been provided impracticable dates for responding in the initial notice generally benefit from this amendment by being provided with useful information. In particular, the Bureau believes that some consumers who might have failed to complete the loss mitigation application altogether when faced with an impracticable date for submitting materials would be more likely to complete the application by a reasonable date as determined under the amended rule, and thus to secure consideration for foreclosure alternatives and some of the important procedural rights available to them under the loss mitigation regulations. Servicers will incur one-time costs for changes to software to check whether the nearest key date is closer than the rule permits and provide the later date in this case. Servicers may also incur costs associated with receiving additional complete loss mitigation applications.</P>

          <P>The Bureau is adding a new provision in &#xA7; 1024.41(b)(3) addressing how borrower protections are determined when no foreclosure sale is scheduled as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received or when a foreclosure sale is rescheduled after receipt of a complete application. Under the final servicing rule, a servicer could,<PRTPAGE P="60434"/>arguably, initiate the foreclosure process on day 121 of delinquency, receive a complete loss mitigation application from a borrower, schedule a foreclosure sale within 90 days, and then provide fewer protections than those afforded to loss mitigation applications received at least 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale. The new provisions provide that if no foreclosure sale has been scheduled as of the date that a complete loss mitigation application is received, the application shall be treated as if it were received at least 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale. In addition, the new provisions make clear that whether certain foreclosure protections and other rights in the rule apply depends on the date for which a foreclosure sale was scheduled at the time of a borrower's complete application. If the scheduled date later changes, the foreclosure protections and other rights that arose at the time of the complete application do not change.</P>
          <P>The Bureau recognizes that the new provisions may reduce some of the flexibility servicers had under the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Rule. This is a cost to servicers. Further, some servicers in possession of an incomplete loss mitigation application on day 121 of delinquency who would not have scheduled a foreclosure sale may now do so in order to avoid the risk of a longer time to foreclosure. As a result, certain borrowers may have less time to respond to a loss mitigation offer and no right to appeal a denial. On the other hand, borrowers with servicers that do not accelerate the scheduling of foreclosure sales have clearer rights and most likely more time to respond to a loss mitigation offer and a right to appeal a denial. The Bureau cannot quantify these different effects, but believes that they are most likely small given the wide range of other factors that determine the time to foreclosure.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is modifying &#xA7; 1024.41(c)(2) to allow servicers to offer certain short-term forbearances to borrowers, notwithstanding the prohibition on servicers offering a loss mitigation option to a borrower based on the review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. This provision imposes no costs on servicers because it does not impose any new obligations on servicers relative to the final rule. The provision benefits servicers by providing a relatively low-cost way for servicers to provide borrowers with a particular loss mitigation option. Similarly, the provision imposes no costs on borrowers since the borrower can reject forbearance based on review of an incomplete loss mitigation option, provide a complete loss mitigation application, and be reviewed for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower (and other protections) as under the final rule. The provision benefits borrowers by providing borrowers with a particular loss mitigation option on the basis of an incomplete application and therefore without exhausting the option to have the servicer review a complete loss mitigation application.</P>
          <P>As discussed above, the Bureau is conscious of the fact that some servicers have significantly exacerbated borrowers' financial difficulties in the past by using short-term forbearance programs inappropriately instead of reviewing the borrowers for long-term options. Thus, in developing this provision, the Bureau has sought to ensure that borrowers would receive significant benefits from forbearance based on review of an incomplete loss mitigation option with minimal additional risk or loss of consumer protections. However, while a long forbearance period creates risks to consumers by generating a significant debt and increasing the chance the borrower might have been better off with an option that the servicer would have offered after evaluating a complete loss mitigation application, the comments received also emphasized heavily that very short forbearance periods do not provide much benefit to borrowers in situations in which forbearance is being used appropriately because they do not allow sufficient time for borrowers to remedy the short-term problems that created the need for forbearance and resume making payments on their loans. The Bureau does not have data with which to identify the average or maximum length of time of forbearance that would balance these factors. Further, the risks to consumers from not specifying a maximum length of time for forbearance are mitigated somewhat by the fact that a borrower who receives a forbearance agreement without having submitted a complete loss mitigation application can trigger a review for loss mitigation options by submitting a complete application more than 37 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale. Taking these factors into account, the Bureau believes that borrowers benefit more from the new forbearance provisions than they would from alternatives that imposed a maximum length of time on forbearance.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is also clarifying the &#x201C;first notice or filing&#x201D; standard in &#xA7; 1024.41(f). The 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules prohibited servicers from making the &#x201C;first notice or filing&#x201D; under state law during the first 120 days of the borrower's delinquency, but interpreted &#x201C;first notice or filing&#x201D; broadly to include notices of default or other notices required by applicable law in order to pursue acceleration of a mortgage loan obligation or the sale of a property securing a mortgage loan obligation. The Bureau is modifying this interpretation and adopting a narrower construction that more closely tracks the Federal Housing Administration's &#x201C;first legal&#x201D; standard. The Bureau also is clarifying how the rule works across states with different foreclosure laws&#x2014;such as in &#x201C;judicial&#x201D; states where foreclosure requires an action filed in court and in &#x201C;non-judicial&#x201D; states where foreclosure requires notice or publication of sale.</P>
          <P>The Bureau believes these amendments will benefit servicers by clarifying the scope of actions prohibited during a borrower's first 120 days in accordance with a familiar standard. In addition, the amendments will not unduly delay foreclosures in states that provide statutory or other notice and cure processes in advance of a foreclosure action or sale by forcing servicers to wait 120 days to send such a notice. The Bureau believes these amendments will benefit borrowers because they will allow notices that do not initiate foreclosure, but instead are intended to provide borrowers with information about counseling and other loss mitigation resources as a means of avoiding foreclosure during the first 120 days of delinquency, when those notices are most likely to benefit borrowers. The Bureau recognizes the possibility that these amendments may, in certain States, allow foreclosure to be initiated more quickly than under the Final Rule, but the Bureau believes that the amendments are beneficial to borrowers overall.</P>

          <P>In addition, the Bureau is modifying or clarifying other Regulation X loss mitigation provisions. The Bureau is amending &#xA7; 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) to state explicitly that the notice required by &#xA7; 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) must state the deadline for accepting or rejecting a servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option. The Bureau is amending &#xA7; 1024.41(h)(4) to provide expressly that the notice informing a borrower of the determination of his or her appeal must also state the amount of time the borrower has to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option after the notice is provided to the borrower. The Bureau is amending &#xA7; 1024.41(f)(1), the prohibition on referral to foreclosure until after the 120th day of delinquency, by exempting a foreclosure based on a borrower's violation of a due-on-sale clause or in which the servicer is joining the foreclosure action of a subordinate<PRTPAGE P="60435"/>lienholder. Finally, the Bureau is clarifying the requirement in &#xA7; 1024.41(d)(1) (re-codified as &#xA7; 1024.41(d)) that a servicer must disclose the reasons for the denial of any trial or permanent loan modification option available to the borrower to make clear that this provision requires the servicer to disclose only determinations actually made by the servicer and does not require a servicer to continue evaluating additional factors after a decision has been established. The Bureau believes these modifications will only minimally increase costs to servicers and the clarifications will likely benefit both servicers and consumers, in part through reduced implementation costs.</P>
          <P>Two of the sets of modifications to the Regulation Z provisions involve loan originator compensation. The Bureau is clarifying for retailers of manufactured homes and their employees what compensation can be attributed to a transaction at the time the interest rate is set and must be included in the points and fees thresholds for qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages under HOEPA. As discussed above, the final rule will exclude from points and fees of loan originator compensation paid by a retailer of manufactured homes to its employees and will clarify that the sales price of a manufactured home does not include loan originator compensation that must be included in points and fees. Both of these changes will reduce the burden for creditors in manufactured home transactions by eliminating the need for them in certain circumstances to attempt to determine what, if any, retailer employee compensation and what, if any, part of the sales price will count as loan originator compensation that must be included in points and fees. This amendment is also likely to lower slightly the amount of money counted toward the points and fees thresholds on the covered loans. As a result, keeping all other provisions of a given loan fixed, this will result in a greater number of loans to be eligible to be qualified mortgages. For such loans, the costs of origination may be slightly lower as a result of the slightly decreased liability for the lender and any assignees and for possibly decreased compliance costs. Consumers may benefit from slightly increased access to credit and lower costs on the affected loans, however these consumers will also not have the added consumer protections that accompany loans made under the general ability-to-repay provisions. The lower amount of points and fees may also lead fewer loans to be above the points and fees triggers for high-cost mortgages under HOEPA: This should make these loans both more available and offered at a lower cost to consumers, though consumers will not have the added consumer protections that apply to high-cost mortgages. A more detailed discussion of these effects is contained in the discussion of benefits, costs, and impacts in part VII of the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule.</P>

          <P>The Bureau also is revising the commentary addressing when employees of a creditor or loan originator in certain administrative or clerical roles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>tellers or greeters) may become &#x201C;loan originators&#x201D; under the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Rule, and therefore subject to that Rule's requirements applicable to loan originators, such as qualification requirements and restrictions on certain compensation practices. As noted above, classifying such individuals as loan originators would subject them to the requirements applicable to loan originators with, in the Bureau's view, little appreciable benefit for consumers. Removing them from this classification should lower compliance costs including those related to SAFE Act training, certification requirements, and compensation restrictions.</P>
          <P>The final rule's provisions regarding credit insurance clarify what constitutes financing of such premiums by a creditor, and is therefore generally prohibited under the Dodd-Frank Act with regard to credit insurance on mortgage loans. The final rule will also clarify when credit insurance premiums are considered to be calculated and paid on a monthly basis for purposes of a statutory exclusion from the prohibition for certain credit insurance premium calculation and payment arrangements. As noted earlier, the Bureau believes that language in the preamble to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule led to some confusion among creditors and credit insurance providers regarding whether credit insurance products were prohibited under the rule based on how their premiums are calculated. The Bureau is now clarifying that the prohibition only extends to creditors financing credit insurance premiums, and providing additional guidance on what constitutes creditor financing and what is excluded from the prohibition. Specifically, the Bureau is finalizing a modified version of the clarification it proposed that provides increased clarity regarding the application of the rule to certain products&#x2014;particularly to insurance with &#x201C;level&#x201D; or &#x201C;levelized&#x201D; premiums&#x2014;and this should benefit both creditors and providers of credit insurance products. As discussed above, the modification will, among other things, permit creditors to continue providing credit insurance products, including those with &#x201C;level&#x201D; or &#x201C;levelized&#x201D; premiums, so long as the premium is not treated as an obligation owed by the consumer beyond the month in which it is due. The Bureau also solicited comment on an alternative clarification, and believes on the basis of comments that the alternative is less clear and no more protective of consumers than the provision the Bureau is finalizing.</P>
          <P>The final rule will also make two adjustments to provisions that provide certain exceptions for creditors operating predominantly in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; areas during the next two years, while the Bureau reexamines the definitions of &#x201C;rural&#x201D; and &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; as it recently announced in the May 2013 ATR Final Rule. Specifically, the final rule will extend an exception to the general prohibition on balloon features for high-cost mortgages under the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule that is available to certain loans made by small creditors who operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas temporarily to all small creditors, regardless of their geographic operations. The final rule will also amend an exemption from the requirement to maintain escrows for higher-priced mortgage loans under the 2013 Escrow Final Rule that is available to small creditors that extended more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions secured by a first lien in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; counties during the preceding calendar year to allow small creditors to qualify for the exemption if they made more than 50 percent of their covered transactions in &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; counties during any of the previous three calendar years.</P>

          <P>As noted above, the Bureau believes expanding the balloon-payment exception for high-cost mortgages to allow certain small creditors operating in areas that do not qualify as &#x201C;rural&#x201D; or &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; to continue to originate certain high-cost mortgages with balloon payments during the next two years will benefit creditors who might be unable to convert to offering adjustable rate mortgages by the time the final rules take effect in January 2014. The final rule will also promote consistency between HOEPA requirements and the May 2013 ATR Final Rule, thereby facilitating compliance for creditors. The Bureau believes that the final rule will also benefit consumers by increasing access to credit relative to the<PRTPAGE P="60436"/>2013 HOEPA Final Rule. Although balloon loans can in some cases increase risks for consumers, the Bureau believes that those risks are appropriately mitigated in these circumstances because the balloon loans must meet the requirements for qualified mortgages in order to qualify for the exception. This includes certain restrictions on the amount of up-front points and fees and various loan features, as well as a requirement that the loans be held on portfolio by the small creditor. These requirements reduce the risk of potentially abusive lending practices and provide strong incentives for the creditor to underwrite the loan appropriately.</P>
          <P>The amendment to the qualifications for the exemption from the escrow requirements should minimize the disruptions from any changes in the categorization of certain counties while the Bureau is reevaluating the underlying definitions. This in turn should lower compliance costs for certain creditors during the interim period. Consumers may benefit from greater access to credit and lower costs, but in return will not receive the benefits of an escrow account. A more detailed discussion of these effects is contained in the discussion of benefits, costs, and impacts in part VII of the 2013 Escrows Final Rule.</P>

          <P>The final rule is generally not expected to have a differential impact on depository institutions and credit unions with $10 billion or less in total assets as described in section 1026. The exceptions are those provisions related to the definitions of &#x201C;rural&#x201D; and &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; which directly impact entities with under $2 billion in total assets. The final rule may have some differential impacts on consumers in rural areas. To the extent that manufactured housing loans, higher-priced mortgage loans, high-cost loans or balloon loans are more prevalent in these areas, the relevant provisions may have slightly greater impacts. As discussed above, costs for creditors in these areas should be reduced; consumers should benefit from increased access to credit and lower costs, though they will not have access to the heightened protections afforded by various provisions. Given the nature and limited scope of the changes in the final rule, the Bureau does not believe that the final rule will reduce consumers' access to consumer financial products and services.</P>

          <P>This rulemaking is part of a series of rules that have revised and expanded the regulatory requirements for entities that originate or service mortgage loans. As noted above, in January, 2013, the Bureau issued the 2013 ATR Final Rule, 2013 Escrows Final Rule, 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, and the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. Since January 2013, the Bureau also has issued the May 2013 ATR Final Rule, May 2013 Escrows Final Rule, and the 2013 Effective Date Final Rule, along with Amendments to the 2013 Mortgage Rules under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z).<SU>60</SU>

          <P>In the alternative, the Bureau also concludes that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. As noted, this final rule generally clarifies the existing rule and to the extent any changes are substantive, these changes will not have a material impact on small entities. The provisions related to servicing do not apply to many small entities under the small servicer exemption (and to the extent that they do, small entities will benefit from the same increased flexibility under the proposed provisions as other servicers), while the provisions related to loan originator compensation and the &#x201C;rural&#x201D; and &#x201C;underserved&#x201D; definitions lower the regulatory burden and possible compliance costs for affected entities. Therefore, the undersigned certifies that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

The Bureau's OMB control number for Regulation B is 3170-0013, for Regulation Z is 3170-0015 and for Regulation X is 3170-0016.
