            <P>The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation Z to implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The final rule implements requirements and restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act concerning loan originator compensation; qualifications of, and registration or licensing of loan originators; compliance procedures for depository institutions; mandatory arbitration; and the financing of single-premium credit insurance. The final rule revises or provides additional commentary on Regulation Z's restrictions on loan originator compensation, including application of these restrictions to prohibitions on dual compensation and compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction, and to recordkeeping requirements. The final rule also establishes tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits-based compensation arrangements. At this time, the Bureau is not prohibiting payments to and receipt of payments by loan originators when a consumer pays upfront points or fees in the mortgage transaction. Instead the Bureau will first study how points and fees function in the market and the impact of this and other mortgage-related rulemakings on consumers' understanding of and choices with respect to points and fees. This final rule is designed primarily to protect consumers by reducing incentives for loan originators to steer consumers into loans with particular terms and by ensuring that loan originators are adequately qualified.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Summary of the Final Rule</HD>
          <P>The mortgage market crisis focused attention on the critical role that loan officers and mortgage brokers play in the loan origination process. Because consumers generally take out only a few home loans over the course of their lives, they often rely heavily on loan officers and brokers to guide them. But prior to the crisis, training and qualification standards for loan originators varied widely, and compensation was frequently structured to give loan originators strong incentives to steer consumers into more expensive loans. Often, consumers paid loan originators an upfront fee without realizing that the creditors in the transactions also were paying the loan originators commissions that increased with the interest rate or other terms.</P>
          <P>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) expanded on previous efforts by lawmakers and regulators to strengthen loan originator qualification requirements and regulate industry compensation practices. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is issuing new rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act requirements, as well as to revise and clarify existing regulations and commentary on loan originator compensation. The rules also implement Dodd-Frank Act provisions that prohibit certain arbitration agreements and the financing of certain credit insurance in connection with a mortgage loan.</P>
          <P>The final rule revises Regulation Z to implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). It contains the following key elements:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Prohibition Against Compensation Based on a Term of a Transaction or Proxy for a Term of a Transaction.</E>Regulation Z already prohibits basing a loan originator's compensation on &#x201C;any of the transaction's terms or conditions.&#x201D; The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this prohibition. The final rule implements the Dodd-Frank Act and clarifies the scope of the rule as follows:</P>
          <P>&#x2022; The final rule defines &#x201C;a term of a transaction&#x201D; as &#x201C;any right or obligation of the parties to a credit transaction.&#x201D; This means, for example, that a mortgage broker cannot receive compensation based on the interest rate of a loan or on the fact that the loan officer steered a consumer to purchase required title insurance from an affiliate of the broker, since the consumer is obligated to pay interest and the required title insurance in connection with the loan.</P>
          <P>&#x2022; To prevent evasion, the final rule prohibits compensation based on a &#x201C;proxy&#x201D; for a term of a transaction. The rule also further clarifies the definition of a proxy to focus on whether: (1) The factor consistently varies with a transaction term over a significant number of transactions; and (2) the loan originator has the ability, directly or indirectly, to add, drop, or change the factor in originating the transaction.</P>
          <P>&#x2022; To prevent evasion, the final rule generally prohibits loan originator compensation from being reduced to offset the cost of a change in transaction terms (often called a &#x201C;pricing concession&#x201D;). However, the final rule allows loan originators to reduce their compensation to defray certain unexpected increases in estimated settlement costs.</P>
          <P>&#x2022; To prevent incentives to &#x201C;up-charge&#x201D; consumers on their loans, the final rule generally prohibits loan originator compensation based upon the profitability of a transaction or a pool of transactions. However, subject to certain restrictions, the final rule permits certain bonuses and retirement and profit-sharing plans to be based on the terms of multiple loan originators' transactions. Specifically, the funds can be used for: (1) Contributions to or benefits under certain designated tax-advantaged retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and certain pension plans; (2) bonuses and other types of non-deferred profits-based compensation if the individual loan originator originated ten or fewer mortgage transactions during the preceding 12 months; and (3) bonuses and other types of non-deferred profits-based compensation that does not exceed 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Prohibition Against Dual Compensation.</E>Regulation Z already provides that where a loan originator receives compensation directly from a consumer in connection with a mortgage loan, no loan originator may receive compensation from another person in connection with the same transaction. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this prohibition, which was designed to address consumer confusion over mortgage broker loyalties where the brokers were receiving payments both from the consumer and the creditor. The final rule implements this restriction but provides an exception to allow mortgage brokers to pay their employees or contractors commissions, although the commissions cannot be based on the terms of the loans that they originate.<PRTPAGE P="11281"/>
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">No Prohibition on Consumer Payment of Upfront Points and Fees.</E>Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a section that would generally have prohibited consumers from paying upfront points or fees on transactions in which the loan originator compensation is paid by a person other than the consumer (either to the creditor's own employee or to a mortgage broker). However, the Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Bureau to waive or create exemptions from the prohibition on upfront points and fees if the Bureau determines that doing so would be in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.</P>
          <P>The Bureau had proposed to waive the ban so that creditors could charge upfront points and fees in connection with a mortgage loan, so long as they made available to consumers an alternative loan that did not include upfront points and fees. The proposal was designed to facilitate consumer shopping, enhance consumer decision-making, and preserve consumer choice and access to credit. The Bureau has decided not to finalize this part of the proposal at this time, however, because of concerns that it would have created consumer confusion and other negative outcomes. The Bureau has decided instead to issue a complete exemption to the prohibition on upfront points and fees pursuant to its exemption authority under section 1403 and other authority while it scrutinizes several crucial issues relating to the proposal's design, operation, and possible effects in a mortgage market undergoing regulatory overhaul. The Bureau is planning consumer testing and other research to understand how new Dodd-Frank Act requirements affect consumers' understanding of and choices with respect to points and fees, so that the Bureau can determine whether further regulation is appropriate to facilitate consumer shopping and enhanced decision-making while protecting access to credit.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Loan Originator Qualifications and Identifier Requirements.</E>The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a duty on individual loan officers, mortgage brokers, and creditors to be &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; and, when applicable, registered or licensed to the extent required under State and Federal law. The final rule imposes duties on loan originator organizations to make sure that their individual loan originators are licensed or registered as applicable under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) and other applicable law. For loan originator employers whose employees are not required to be licensed, including depository institutions and bona fide nonprofits, the rule requires them to: (1) Ensure that their loan originator employees meet character, fitness, and criminal background standards similar to existing SAFE Act licensing standards; and (2) provide training to their loan originator employees that is appropriate and consistent with those loan originators' origination activities. The final rule contains special provisions with respect to criminal background checks and the circumstances in which a criminal conviction is disqualifying, and with respect to situations in which a credit check on a loan originator is required.</P>
          <P>The final rule also implements a Dodd-Frank Act requirement that loan originators provided their unique identifiers under the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR) on loan documents. Accordingly, mortgage brokers, creditors, and individual loan originators that are primarily responsible for a particular origination will be required to list on enumerated loan documents their NMLSR unique identifiers (NMLSR IDs), if any, along with their names.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Prohibition on Mandatory Arbitration Clauses and Single Premium Credit Insurance.</E>The final rule also contains language implementing two other Dodd-Frank Act provisions concerning mortgage loan originations. The first prohibits the inclusion of clauses requiring the consumer to submit disputes concerning a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit to binding arbitration. It also prohibits the application or interpretation of provisions of such loans or related agreements so as to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law. The second provision prohibits the financing of any premiums or fees for credit insurance (such as credit life insurance) in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling, but allows credit insurance to be paid for on a monthly basis.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Other Provisions.</E>The final rule also extends existing recordkeeping requirements concerning loan originator compensation so that they apply to both creditors and mortgage brokers for three years. The rule also clarifies the definition of &#x201C;loan originator&#x201D; for purposes of the compensation and qualification rules, including exclusions for certain employees of manufactured home retailers, servicers, seller financers, and real estate brokers; management, clerical, and administrative staff; and loan processors, underwriters, and closers.</P>

            <FTREF/>During the last decade, the market went through an unprecedented cycle of expansion and contraction that was fueled in part by the securitization of mortgages and creation of increasingly sophisticated derivative products. So many other parts of the American financial system were drawn into mortgage-related activities that, when the housing market collapsed in 2008, it sparked the most severe recession in the United States since the Great Depression.<SU>2</SU>

          <P>Growth in the mortgage loan market was particularly pronounced in what are known as &#x201C;subprime&#x201D; and &#x201C;Alt-A&#x201D; products. Subprime products were sold<PRTPAGE P="11282"/>primarily to borrowers with poor or no credit history, although some borrowers who would have qualified for &#x201C;prime&#x201D; loans were steered into subprime loans instead.<SU>6</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Alt-A category of loans permitted borrowers to take out mortgage loans while providing little or no documentation of income or other evidence of repayment ability. Because these loans involved additional risk, they were typically more expensive to borrowers than &#x201C;prime&#x201D; mortgages, although many of them had very low introductory interest rates. In 2003, subprime and Alt-A origination volume was almost $400 billion; in 2006, it had reached $1 trillion.<SU>7</SU>

          <P>So long as housing prices were continuing to increase, it was relatively easy for borrowers to refinance their existing loans into more affordable products to avoid interest rate resets and other adjustments. When housing prices began to decline in 2005, refinancing became more difficult and delinquency rates on these subprime and Alt-A products increased dramatically.<SU>8</SU>
            <FTREF/>More and more consumers, especially those with subprime and Alt-A loans, were unable or unwilling to make their mortgage payments. An early sign of the mortgage crisis was an upswing in early payment defaults&#x2014;generally defined as borrowers being 60 or more days delinquent within the first year. Prior to 2006, 1.1 percent of mortgages would end up 60 or more days delinquent within the first year.<SU>9</SU>
            <FTREF/>Taking a more expansive definition of early payment default to include 60 days delinquent within the first two years, this figure was double the historic average during 2006, 2007, and 2008.<SU>10</SU>
            <FTREF/>In 2006, 2007, and 2008, 2.3 percent, 2.1 percent, and 2.3 percent of mortgages ended up 60 or more days delinquent within the first two years, respectively. In addition, as the economy worsened, the rates of serious delinquency (90 or more days past due or in foreclosure) for the subprime and Alt-A products began a steep increase from approximately 10 percent in 2006, to 20 percent in 2007, to more than 40 percent in 2010.<SU>11</SU>

          <P>The impact of this level of delinquencies was severe on creditors who held loans on their books and on private investors who purchased loans directly or through securitized vehicles. Prior to and during the housing bubble, the evolution of the securitization of mortgages attracted increasing involvement from financial institutions that were not directly involved in the extension of credit to consumers and from investors worldwide. Securitization of mortgages allows originating creditors to sell off their loans (and reinvest the funds earned in making new ones) to investors who want an income stream over time. Securitization had been pioneered by what are now called government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). But by the early 2000s, large numbers of private financial institutions were deeply involved in creating increasingly complex mortgage-related investment vehicles through securities and derivative products. The private securitization-backed subprime and Alt-A mortgage market ground to a halt in 2007 in the face of the rising delinquencies on subprime and Alt-A products.<SU>12</SU>

          <P>In light of these conditions, the Federal Government began providing support to the mortgage markets in 2008 and continues to do so at extraordinary levels today. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), which became effective on October 1, 2008, provided both new safeguards and increased regulation for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as provisions to assist troubled borrowers and the hardest hit communities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which supported the mainstream mortgage market, experienced heavy losses and were placed in conservatorship by the Federal government in 2008 to support the collapsing mortgage market.<SU>15</SU>
            <FTREF/>Because private investors have withdrawn from the mortgage securitization market and there are no other effective secondary market mechanisms in place, the GSEs' continued operations help ensure that the secondary mortgage market continues to function and to assist consumers in obtaining new mortgages or refinancing existing mortgages. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), created to implement programs to stabilize the financial system during the financial crisis, was authorized through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and includes programs to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.<SU>16</SU>
            <FTREF/>Since 2008, several other<PRTPAGE P="11283"/>Federal government efforts have endeavored to keep the country's housing finance system functioning, including the Treasury Department's and the Federal Reserve System's mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase programs to help keep interest rates low and the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA's) increased market presence. As a result, mortgage credit has remained available, albeit with more restrictive underwriting terms that limit or preclude some consumers' access to credit. These same government agencies together with the GSEs and other market participants have also undertaken a series of efforts to help families avoid foreclosure through loan-modification programs, loan-refinance programs and foreclosure alternatives.<SU>17</SU>

              <SU>16</SU>The Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) is the umbrella program for Treasury's homeowner assistance and foreclosure mitigation efforts. The main MHA components are the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a Treasury program that uses TARP funds to provide incentives for mortgage servicers to modify eligible first-lien mortgages, and two initiatives at the GSEs that use non-TARP funds. Incentive payments for modifications to loans owned or guaranteed by the GSEs are paid by the GSEs, not TARP. Treasury over time expanded MHA to include sub-programs designed to overcome obstacles to sustainable HAMP modifications. Treasury also allocated TARP funds to support two additional housing support efforts: an FHA refinancing program and TARP funding for 19 state housing finance agencies, called the Housing Finance Agency Hardest Hit Fund. In the first half of 2012, Treasury extended the application period for HAMP by a year to December 31, 2013, and opened HAMP to non-owner-occupied rental properties and to consumers with a wider range of debt-to-income ratios under &#x201C;HAMP Tier 2.&#x201D;</P>

          <P>The current mortgage market is especially fragile as a result of the recent mortgage crisis. Tight credit remains an important factor in the contraction in mortgage lending seen over the past few years. Mortgage loan terms and credit standards have tightened most for consumers with lower credit scores and with less money available for a down payment. According to CoreLogic's TrueStandings Servicing, a proprietary data service that covers about two-thirds of the mortgage market, average underwriting standards have tightened considerably since 2007. Through the first nine months of 2012, for consumers that have received closed-end first-lien mortgages, the weighted average FICO<SU>26</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Mortgage Origination Process and Origination Channels</HD>
          <P>As discussed above, the mortgage market crisis focused attention on the critical role that loan officers and mortgage brokers play in guiding consumers through the loan origination process. Consumers must go through a mortgage origination process to obtain a mortgage loan. There are many actors involved in a mortgage origination. In addition to the creditor and the consumer, a transaction may involve a loan officer employed by a creditor, a mortgage broker, settlement agent, appraiser, multiple insurance providers, local government clerks and tax offices, and others. Purchase money loans involve additional parties such as sellers and real estate agents. These third parties typically charge fees or commissions for the services they provide which may be paid directly by the consumer or from loan proceeds, or indirectly through a creditor or broker.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Application.</E>To obtain a mortgage loan, consumers must first apply through a loan originator. There are three different &#x201C;channels&#x201D; for mortgage loan origination in the current market:</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Retail:</E>The consumer deals with a loan officer that works directly for the mortgage creditor, such as a bank, credit union, or specialized mortgage finance company. The creditor typically operates a network of branches, but may also communicate with consumers through mail and the internet. The entire origination transaction is conducted within the corporate structure of the creditor, and the loan is closed using funds supplied by the creditor. Depending on the type of creditor, the creditor may hold the loan in its portfolio or sell the loan to investors on the secondary market, as discussed further below.</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Wholesale:</E>The consumer deals with an independent mortgage broker, which may be an individual or a mortgage brokerage firm. The broker may seek offers from many different creditors, and then acts as a liaison between the consumer and whichever creditor ultimately closes the loan. At closing, the loan is consummated by using the creditor's funds, and the mortgage note is written in the creditor's name.<SU>34</SU>
            <FTREF/>Again, the creditor may hold the loan in its portfolio or sell the loan on the secondary market.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>34</SU>In some cases, mortgage brokers use a process called &#x201C;table funding,&#x201D; in which the transaction is closed using the wholesale creditor's funds at the settlement table, but the loan is closed in the broker's name. The broker simultaneously assigns the closed loan to the creditor. These types of transactions generally require the use of approved title companies or title attorneys of the creditor to assure strict adherence to the creditor's closing instructions. Such transactions are only valid in those states that allow &#x201C;wet closings.&#x201D; These types of closings are not as common today.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Correspondent:</E>The consumer deals with a loan officer that works directly for a &#x201C;correspondent lender&#x201D; that does not deal directly with the secondary market. At closing, the correspondent lender closes the loans using its own funds, but then immediately sells the loan to an &#x201C;acquiring creditor,&#x201D; which in turn either holds the loan in portfolio or sells it on the secondary market.</P>
          <P>Both loan officers and mortgage brokers generally provide information to consumers about different types of loans and advise consumers on choosing a loan. Consumers rely on loan officers and mortgage brokers to determine what kind of loan best suits the consumers' needs. Loan officers and mortgage brokers also take a consumers' completed loan application for submission to the creditor's loan underwriter. The applications include consumers' credit and income information, along with information about the home to be purchased. Consumers can work with multiple loan originators to compare the loan offers that loan originators may obtain on their behalf from creditors. Once the consumers have decided to move forward with a loan, the loan originator may request additional information or documents from the consumers to support the information in the application and obtain an appraisal of the property.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Underwriting.</E>Historically, the creditor's loan underwriter used the application and additional information to confirm initial information provided by the consumer. The underwriter assessed whether the creditor should take on the risk of making the mortgage loan. To make this decision, the underwriter considered whether the consumer could repay the loan and whether the home was worth enough to serve as collateral for the loan. If the underwriter found that the consumer and the home qualified, the underwriter would approve the consumer's mortgage application.</P>
          <P>During the years preceding the mortgage crisis, much of this process broke down as previously discussed. Underwriting today appears to have largely returned to these historical norms. The Bureau's 2013 Ability To Repay (ATR) Final Rule is designed, in substantial part, to assure that as credit continues improve, creditors do not return to the problematic practices of the last decade.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Closing.</E>After being approved for a mortgage loan, completing any closing requirements, and receiving necessary disclosures, the consumer can close on the loan. Multiple parties participate at closing, including the consumer, the creditor, and the settlement agent. In some instances, the loan originator also functions as the settlement agent. More commonly, a separate individual handles the settlement, although that individual may be an employee of the creditor or brokerage firm or of an affiliate of one of those.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Loan Pricing and Disposition of Closed Loans</HD>
          <P>From the consumer's perspective, loan pricing depends on several elements:</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Loan terms.</E>The loan terms affect consumer costs and how the loan is to be repaid, including the type of loan &#x201C;product,&#x201D; the method of calculating monthly payments and repayment (for example, whether the payments are fully amortizing) and the length of the loan term.<SU>35</SU>
            <FTREF/>The most important single term in determining the price is, of course, the interest rate (and for adjustable rate mortgages the index and margin).</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>35</SU>The meaning of loan &#x201C;product&#x201D; is not firmly established and varies with the person using the term, but it generally refers to various combinations of features such as the type of interest rate and the form of amortization. Feature distinctions often thought of as distinct &#x201C;loan products&#x201D; include, for example, fixed rate versus adjustable rate loans and fully amortizing versus interest-only or negatively amortizing loans.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Discount points and cash rebates.</E>Discount points are paid by consumers to the creditor to purchase a lower interest rate. Conversely, creditors may<PRTPAGE P="11285"/>offer consumers a cash rebate at closing which can help cover upfront closing costs in exchange for paying a higher rate over the life of the loan. Both discount points and creditor rebates involve an exchange of cash now (in the form of a payment or credit at closing) for cash over time (in the form of a reduced or increased interest rate). Consumers will also incur some third-party fees in connection with a mortgage application such as the fee for an appraisal or for a credit report. These may be paid at origination or, in some cases, at closing.</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Origination points or fees.</E>Creditors and loan originators also sometimes charge origination points or fees, which are typically presented as charges to apply for the loan. Origination fees can take a number of forms: A flat dollar amount, a percentage of the loan amount (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>an &#x201C;origination point&#x201D;), or a combination of the two. Origination points or fees may also be framed as a single lump sum or as several different fees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>application fee, underwriting fee, document preparation fee).</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Closing costs.</E>Closing costs are the additional upfront costs of completing a mortgage transaction, including appraisal fees, title insurance, recording fees, taxes, and homeowner's insurance, for example. These closing costs, as distinct from upfront discount points and origination charges, often are paid to third parties other than the creditor or loan originator.</P>
          <P>In practice, both discount points and origination points or fees are revenue to the lender or loan originator, and that revenue is fungible. The existence of two types of fees and the many names lenders use for origination fees&#x2014;some of which may appear to be more negotiable than others&#x2014;has the potential to confuse consumers.</P>
          <P>Determining the appropriate trade-off between payments now and payments later requires a consumer to have a clear sense of how long he or she expects to stay in the home and in the particular loan. If the consumer plans to stay in the home for a number of years without refinancing, paying points to obtain a lower rate may make sense because the consumer will save more in monthly payments than he or she pays up front in discount points. If the consumer expects to move or refinance within a few years, however, then agreeing to pay a higher rate on the loan to reduce out of pocket expenses at closing may make sense because the consumer will save more up front than he or she will pay in increased monthly payments before moving or refinancing. There is a break-even moment in time where the present value of a reduction/increase to the rate just equals the corresponding upfront points/credits. If the consumer moves or refinances earlier (in the case of discount points) or later (in the case of creditor rebates) than the break-even moment, then the consumer will lose money compared to a consumer that neither paid discount points nor received creditor rebates.</P>
          <P>The creditor's assessment of pricing&#x2014;and in particular what different combinations of points, fees, and interest rates it is willing to offer particular consumers&#x2014;is also driven by the trade-off between upfront and long-term payments. Creditors in general would prefer to receive as much money as possible up front, because having to wait for payments to come in over the life of the loan increases the level of risk. If consumers ultimately pay off a loan earlier than expected or cannot pay off a loan due to financial distress, the creditors will not earn the overall expected return on the loan. However, for creditors, as for consumers, there is a break-even point where the present value of a reduction/increase to the rate just equals the corresponding upfront points/credits. If the creditor reduces the upfront costs in return for a higher interest rate and the consumer continues to make payments on the loan beyond the break-even points, the creditor will come out ahead.</P>
          <P>The creditor's calculation of these tradeoffs is generally heavily influenced by the secondary market, which allows creditors to sell off their loans to investors, recoup the capital they have invested in the loans, and recycle that capital into new loans. The investors then benefit from the payment streams over time, as well as bearing the risk of early payment or default. As described above, the creditor can benefit from going on to make additional money from additional loans. Thus, although some banks<SU>36</SU>
            <FTREF/>and credit unions hold some loans in portfolio over time, many creditors prefer not to hold loans until maturity.<SU>37</SU>

              <SU>37</SU>For companies that are affiliated with securitizers, the processing fees involved in creating investment vehicles on the secondary market can itself become a distinct revenue stream. Although the secondary market was originally created by government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide liquidity for the mortgage market, over time, Wall Street companies began packaging mortgage loans into private-label mortgage-backed securities. Subprime and Alt-A loans, in particular, were often sold into private-label securities. During the boom, a number of large creditors started securitizing the loans themselves in-house, thereby capturing the final piece of the loan's value.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>When a creditor sells a loan into the secondary market, the creditor is exchanging an asset (the loan) that produces regular cash flows (principal and interest) for an upfront cash payment from the buyer.<SU>38</SU>
            <FTREF/>That upfront cash payment represents the buyer's present valuation of the loan's future cash flows, using assumptions about the rate of prepayments due to moves and refinancings, the rate of expected defaults, the rate of return relative to other investments, and other factors. Secondary market buyers assume considerable risk in determining the price they are willing to pay for a loan. If, for example, loans prepay faster than expected or default at higher rates than expected, the investor will receive a lower return than expected. Conversely, if loans prepay more slowly than expected, or default at lower rates than expected, the investor will earn a higher return over time than expected.<SU>39</SU>

              <SU>38</SU>For simplicity, this discussion assumes that the secondary market buyer is a person other than the creditor, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or a Wall Street investment bank. In practice, during the mortgage boom, some creditors securitized their own loans. In this case, the secondary market price for the loans was effectively determined by the price investors were willing to pay for the subsequent securities.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>39</SU>For simplicity, these examples do not take into account the use of various risk mitigation techniques, such as risk-sharing counterparties and loan level mortgage or other security credit enhancements.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Secondary market mortgage prices are typically quoted in relation to the principal loan amount and are specific to a given interest rate and other factors that are correlated with default risk. For illustrative purposes, at some point in time, a loan with an interest rate of 3.5 percent might earn 102.5 in the secondary market. This means that for every $100 in initial loan principal amount, the secondary market buyer will pay $102.50. Of that amount, $100 is to cover the principal amount and $2.50 is revenue to the creditor in exchange for the rights to the future interest payments on the loan.<SU>40</SU>

            <FTREF/>The secondary market price of a loan increases or decreases along with the loan's interest rate, but the relationship is not typically linear. In other words, using the above example at the same point in time, loans with interest rates higher than 3.5 percent will typically earn more than 102.5, and loans with interest rates less than 3.5 percent will typically earn less than 102.5. However, each subsequent 0.125 percent increment in interest rate above or below 3.5 percent may not be associated with the same size increment in<PRTPAGE P="11286"/>secondary market price.<SU>41</SU>
            <FTREF/>The same style of pricing is used when correspondent lenders sell loans to acquiring creditors.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>In some cases, secondary market prices can actually be less than the principal amount of the loan. A price of 98.75, for example, means that for every $100 in principal, the selling creditor receives only $98.75. This represents a loss of $1.25 per $100 of principal just on the sale of the loan, before the creditor takes its expenses into account. This usually happens when the interest rate on the loan is below prevailing interest rates. But so long as discount points or other origination charges can cover the shortfall, the creditor will still make its expected return on the loan.</P>
          <P>Discount points are also valuable to creditors (and secondary market investors) for another reason: because payment of discount points signals the consumer's expectations about how long he or she expects to stay in the loan, they make prepayment risk easier to predict. The more discount points a consumer pays, the longer the consumer likely expects to keep the loan in place. This fact mitigates a creditor's or investor's uncertainty about how long interest payments can be expected to continue, which facilitates assigning a present value to the loan's yield and, therefore, setting the loan's price.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Loan Originator Compensation</HD>
          <P>Brokerage firms and loan officers are typically paid a commission that is a percentage of the loan amount. Prior to 2010, it was common for the percentage to vary based upon the interest rate of the loan: commissions on loans with higher interest rates were higher than commission on loans with lower interest rates (just as the premiums paid by the secondary market for loans vary with the interest rate). This was typically called a &#x201C;yield spread premium.&#x201D;<SU>42</SU>
            <FTREF/>In the wholesale context, the loan originator might keep the entire yield spread premium as a commission, or he or she might provide some of the yield spread premium to the borrower as a credit against closing costs.<SU>43</SU>

              <SU>42</SU>Some commenters use the term &#x201C;yield spread premium&#x201D; to refer to any payment from a creditor to a mortgage broker that is funded by increasing the interest rate that would otherwise be charged to the consumer in the absence of that payment. These commenters generally assume that any payment to the brokerage firm by the creditor is funded out of the interest rate, reasoning that had the consumer paid the brokerage firm directly, the creditor would have had lower expenses and would have been able to charge a lower rate. Other commenters use the term &#x201C;yield spread premium&#x201D; more narrowly to refer only to a payment from a creditor to a mortgage broker that is based on the interest rate, i.e., the mortgage broker receives a larger payment if the consumer agrees to a higher interest rate. To avoid confusion, the Bureau is limiting its use of the term and is instead more specifically describing the payment at issue.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>43</SU>Mortgage brokers, and some retail loan officers, were compensated in this fashion. Some retail loan officers may have been paid a salary with a bonus for loan volume, rather than yield spread premium-based commissions.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>While this system was in place, it was common for loan originator commissions to mirror secondary market pricing closely. The &#x201C;price&#x201D; that the creditor offered to its brokers was somewhat lower than the price that the creditor expected to receive from the secondary market&#x2014;the creditor kept the difference as corporate revenue. However, the underlying mechanics of the secondary market flowed through to the loan originator's compensation. The higher the interest rate on the loan or the more in upfront charges the consumer pays to the creditor (or both), the greater the compensation available to the loan originator. This created a situation in which the loan originator had a financial incentive to steer consumers into the highest interest rate possible or to impose on the consumer additional upfront charges payable to the creditor.</P>
          <P>In a perfectly competitive and transparent market, competition would ensure that this incentive would be countered by the need to compete with other loan originators to offer attractive loan terms to consumers. However, the mortgage origination market is neither always perfectly competitive nor always transparent, and consumers (who take out a mortgage only a few times in their lives) may be uninformed about how prices work and what terms they can expect.<SU>44</SU>
            <FTREF/>Moreover, prior to 2010, mortgage brokers were free to charge consumers directly for additional origination points or fees, which were generally described to the consumer as compensating for the time and expense of working with the consumer to submit the loan application. This compensation structure was problematic both because the loan originator had an incentive to steer borrowers into less favorable pricing terms while the consumer may have paid origination fees to the loan originator believing that the loan originator was working for the borrower, without knowing that the loan originator was receiving compensation from the creditor as well.</P>

          <P>Congress enacted the TILA based on findings that the informed use of credit resulting from consumers' awareness of the cost of credit would enhance economic stability and would strengthen competition among consumer credit providers. 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). One of the purposes of TILA is to provide meaningful disclosure of credit terms to enable consumers to compare credit terms available in the marketplace more readily and avoid the uninformed use of credit.<E T="03">Id.</E>TILA's disclosures differ depending on whether credit is an open-end (revolving) plan or a closed-end (installment) loan. TILA also contains procedural and substantive protections for consumers. TILA is implemented by the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, though historically the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, had implemented TILA.<SU>45</SU>

          </FTNT>

          <P>In the aftermath of the mortgage crisis, regulators and lawmakers began focusing on concerns about the steering of consumers into less favorable loan terms than those for which they otherwise qualified. Both the Board and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had explored the use of disclosures to inform consumers about loan originator compensation practices. HUD adopted a new disclosure regime under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), in a 2008 final rule, which addressed among other matters the disclosure of mortgage broker compensation. 73 FR 68204, 68222-27 (Nov. 17, 2008). The Board also proposed a disclosure-based approach to addressing concerns with mortgage broker compensation. 73 FR 1672, 1698 (Jan. 9, 2008). The Board later determined, however, that the proposed approach presented a significant risk of misleading consumers regarding both the relative costs of brokers and creditors and the role of brokers in their transactions and, consequently, withdrew that aspect of the 2008 proposal as part of its 2008 Home Ownership and Equity Protection<PRTPAGE P="11287"/>Act (HOEPA) Final Rule.<SU>46</SU>
            <FTREF/>73 FR 44522, 44564 (July 30, 2008).</P>

            <P>
              <SU>46</SU>The Board indicated that it would continue to explore available options to address potential unfairness associated with loan originator compensation practices. 73 FR 44522, 44565 (July 30, 2008).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The Board in 2009 proposed new rules addressing in a more substantive fashion loan originator compensation practices. The Board's proposal included, among other provisions, proposed rules prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction's terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation as described above, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from &#x201C;steering&#x201D; consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation. The Board based that proposal on its authority to prohibit acts or practices in the mortgage market that the Board found to be unfair, deceptive, or (in the case of refinancings) abusive under TILA section 129(l)(2) (now redesignated as TILA section 129(p)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1639(p)(2)). 74 FR 43232, 43279-286 (Aug. 26, 2009). Although the Board issued its proposal prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress subsequently amended TILA to codify significant elements of the Board's proposal.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>15 U.S.C. 1639b (Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Board therefore decided in 2010 to finalize the rules it had proposed under its preexisting TILA powers, while acknowledging that further rulemaking would be required to address certain issues and adjustments made by the Dodd-Frank Act.<SU>47</SU>
            <FTREF/>75 FR 58509 (Sept. 24, 2010) (2010 Loan Originator Final Rule). The Board's 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule took effect in April 2011.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>47</SU>As the Board explained: &#x201C;The Board has decided to issue this final rule on loan originator compensation and steering, even though a subsequent rulemaking will be necessary to implement Section 129B(c). The Board believes that Congress was aware of the Board's proposal and that in enacting TILA Section 129B(c), Congress sought to codify the Board's proposed prohibitions while expanding them in some respects and making other adjustments. The Board further believes that it can best effectuate the legislative purpose of the [Dodd-Frank Act] by finalizing its proposal relating to loan origination compensation and steering at this time. Allowing enactment of TILA Section 129B(c) to delay final action on the Board's prior regulatory proposal would have the opposite effect intended by the legislation by allowing the continuation of the practices that Congress sought to prohibit.&#x201D; 75 FR 58509 (Sept. 24, 2010).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Most notably, the Board's 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule substantially restricted the payments to loan originators which create incentives for them to steer consumers to more expensive loans. Under this rule, creditors may not base a loan originator's compensation on the transaction's terms or conditions, other than the mortgage loan amount. In addition, the rule prohibits &#x201C;dual compensation,&#x201D; in which a loan originator is paid compensation by both the consumer and the creditor (or any other person).<E T="03">See generally</E>12 CFR 226.36(d). After authority for Regulation Z transferred from the Board, the Bureau republished the rule at 12 CFR 1026.36(d). 76 FR 79768 (Dec. 22, 2011).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. The SAFE Act</HD>
          <P>The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), 12 U.S.C. 5106-5116, generally prohibits an individual from engaging in the business of a loan originator without first obtaining, and maintaining annually, a unique identifier from the NMLSR and either a registration as a registered loan originator or a license and registration as a State-licensed loan originator. 12 U.S.C. 5103. Loan originators who are employees of depository institutions are generally subject to the registration requirement, which is implemented by the Bureau's Regulation G, 12 CFR part 1007. Other loan originators are generally subject to the State licensing requirement, which is implemented by the Bureau's Regulation H, 12 CFR part 1008, and by State law.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. The Dodd-Frank Act</HD>

          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act expanded on previous efforts by lawmakers and regulators to strengthen loan originator qualification requirements and regulate industry compensation practices. Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (approved July 21, 2010). The Dodd-Frank Act adopted several new provisions concerning the compensation and qualifications of mortgage originators, defined related terms, and prohibited certain arbitration and credit insurance financing practices.<E T="03">See</E>Dodd-Frank Act sections 1401, 1402, 1403, and 1414. Section 1401 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 103 to add definitions of the term &#x201C;mortgage originator&#x201D; and of other terms relating to mortgage loan origination. 15 U.S.C. 1602. Section 1402 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 129 by redesignating existing text and adding section 129B to require mortgage originators to meet qualification standards and depository institutions to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure compliance with these qualification standards, the loan originator registration procedures established pursuant to the SAFE Act, and the other requirements of TILA section 129B. TILA section 129B also requires mortgage originators to provide their license or registration number on loan documents. 15 U.S.C. 1639b. Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended new TILA section 129B to prohibit loan originator compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan, other than the amount of the principal, and generally to prohibit loan originators from being compensated simultaneously by both the consumer and a person other than the consumer. Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act also added new TILA section 129B(c)(2), which would generally have prohibited consumers from paying upfront points or fees on transactions in which the loan originator compensation is paid by the creditor (either to the creditor's own employee or to a mortgage broker). However, TILA section 129B(c)(2) also authorized the Bureau to waive or create exemptions from the prohibition on upfront points and fees if the Bureau determines that doing so would be in the interest of consumers and in the public interest. Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended new TILA section 129C, in part to prohibit certain financing practices for single-premium credit insurance and debt cancellation or suspension agreements and to restrict mandatory arbitration agreements.</P>

          <P>In developing a proposal to implement sections 1401, 1402, 1403, and 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau conducted extensive outreach. Bureau staff met with and held in-depth conference calls with large and small bank and non-bank mortgage creditors, mortgage brokers, trade associations, secondary market participants, consumer groups, nonprofit organizations, and State regulators. Discussions covered existing business models and compensation practices and the impact of the existing 2010 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. They also covered the Dodd-Frank Act provisions and the impact on consumers, loan originators, lenders, and secondary market participants of various options for implementing the statutory provisions. The Bureau developed several of the proposed clarifications of existing regulatory requirements in response to compliance inquiries and with input from industry participants.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Proposed Rule</HD>

          <P>On September 7, 2012, the Bureau published a proposed rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to implement the Dodd-Frank Act requirements, as well as to revise and clarify existing regulations and commentary on loan originator compensation. 77 FR 55272 (Sept. 7, 2012) (the &#x201C;2012 Loan Originator Compensation Proposal&#x201D;). The proposal included the following main provisions:</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Restrictions on Loan Originator Compensation</HD>
          <P>The proposal would have adjusted existing rules governing compensation to loan officers and mortgage brokers in connection with closed-end mortgage transactions to account for the Dodd-Frank Act and to provide greater clarity and flexibility. Specifically, the proposal would have continued the general ban on paying or receiving commissions or other loan originator compensation based on the terms of the transaction (other than loan amount), with some refinements.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Pricing Concessions:</E>The proposal would have allowed loan originators to reduce their compensation to cover unanticipated increases in closing costs from non-affiliated third parties under certain circumstances.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Proxies:</E>The proposal would have clarified when a factor used as a basis for compensation is prohibited as a &#x201C;proxy&#x201D; for a transaction term.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Profit-sharing:</E>The proposal would have clarified and revised restrictions on pooled compensation, profit-sharing, and bonus plans for loan originators by permitting contributions from general profits derived from mortgage activity to 401(k) plans, employee stock plans, and other &#x201C;qualified plans&#x201D; under tax and employment law. The proposal would have permitted payment of bonuses or contributions to non-qualified profit-sharing or retirement plans from general profits derived from mortgage activity if either: (1) The loan originator affected has originated five or fewer mortgage transactions during the last 12 months; or (2) the company's mortgage business revenues are a limited percentage of its total revenues. The proposal solicited comment on other alternatives to the measure based on company revenue, including an individual loan originator total compensation test.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Dual Compensation:</E>The proposal would have continued the general ban on loan originators being compensated by both consumers and other persons but would have allowed mortgage brokerage firms that are paid by the consumer to pay their individual brokers a commission, so long as the commission is not based on the terms of the transaction.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Restriction on Upfront Points and Fees</HD>
          <P>The Bureau proposed to use its exemption authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to allow creditors and loan originator organizations to continue making available loans with consumer-paid upfront points or fees, so long as they also make available a comparable, alternative loan without those points or fees. The proposal generally would have required that, before a creditor or loan originator organization may impose upfront points or fees on a consumer in a closed-end mortgage transaction, the creditor must make available to the consumer a comparable, alternative loan with no upfront discount points, origination points, or origination fees that are retained by the creditor, broker, or an affiliate of either (a &#x201C;zero-zero alternative&#x201D;). The requirement would not have applied where the consumer is unlikely to qualify for the zero-zero alternative. The Bureau solicited comments on variations and alternatives to this approach.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Loan Originator Qualification Requirements</HD>
          <P>The proposal would have implemented the Dodd-Frank Act provision requiring each loan originator both to be &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; and to include his or her NMLSR ID on certain specified loan documents. The proposal would have required loan originator organizations to ensure their loan originators not already required to be licensed under the SAFE Act meet character, fitness, and criminal background check standards that are similar to SAFE Act requirements and receive training commensurate with their duties. The loan originator organization and the individual loan originators that are primarily responsible for a particular transaction would have been required to list their NMLSR ID and names on certain key loan documents.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Other Provisions</HD>
          <P>The proposal would have banned both agreements requiring consumers to submit any disputes that may arise to mandatory arbitration rather than filing suit in court, and the financing of premiums for credit insurance.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Overview of Public Comments</HD>

          <P>The Bureau received 713 comments on the 2012 Loan Originator Compensation Proposal. The comments came from individual consumers, consumer groups, community banks, large banks, large bank holding companies, secondary market participants, credit unions, nonbank servicers, State and national trade associations for financial institutions, local and national community groups, Federal and State regulators, academics, and other interested parties. Although<PRTPAGE P="11289"/>some commenters provided comments on all of the major provisions of the 2012 Loan Originator Compensation Proposal, most commenters focused on specific aspects of the proposal, as discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis below.</P>
          <P>Many commenters addressed the proposed provisions regarding records that creditors and loan originator organizations would have been required to maintain to demonstrate compliance with the compensation-related provisions of the proposal. The majority of commenters agreed with the Bureau's belief that the proposed increase in the recordkeeping period from two years to three years would not significantly increase costs. Some commenters asked for clarification regarding what types of records would be required to be maintained.</P>

          <P>Numerous commenters addressed the proposed definition of &#x201C;loan originator,&#x201D; which determines which persons would be subject to several of the provisions in the proposal. The topic that the largest number of commenters addressed was the exception from the definition of &#x201C;loan originator&#x201D; for certain persons who provide financing to consumers who purchase a dwelling from these persons (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>&#x201C;seller financing&#x201D;). Individuals, industry professionals, and small business owners commented that the Bureau had overlooked the impact that the proposal would have on consumers, stating that it would reduce access to credit for some while eliminating a reliable retirement vehicle for others.</P>

          <P>A large number of commenters addressed the Bureau's proposal to allow creditors to charge upfront origination points, discounts, and fees in transactions in which someone other than the consumer pays compensation to a loan originator, provided that the creditor make available to the consumer loan terms without upfront origination points, discount points, or fees (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the zero-zero alternative). One of the most common assertions from commenters relating to points and fees was that the zero-zero alternative restrictions were duplicative of other regulations, or that the restrictions being implemented in other rules were sufficient and more effective at protecting consumers.</P>
          <P>Many banks, credit unions, and mortgage professionals expressed concern that prohibiting discount points would result in higher interest rates, could reduce access to credit for consumers, and would subject the creditors to higher-priced mortgage rules. Banks and credit unions opined that complying with the proposal would make lower-value loans unprofitable and banks and credit unions would no longer be able to profitably serve that segment of the market.</P>
          <P>A significant number of commenters asserted that the proposal would have a negative impact on affiliated businesses, namely inconvenience, reduced pricing advantages, and duplicative processes. Other commenters advocated exempting fees for title services from the types of compensation treated as loan originator compensation when it is paid to an affiliate. Several commenters asserted that a restriction on title services would not benefit consumers and could detrimentally limit consumers' credit options.</P>
          <P>There was no consensus among consumer groups on whether, or how, the Bureau should use its exemption authority regarding the statutory ban on consumers paying upfront points and fees. Some industry commenters advocated adjustments or alternatives to the zero-zero proposal, rather than a complete exemption, although the approaches varied by commenter.</P>
          <P>A large number of comments addressed qualification standards for loan originators who are not subject to State licensing requirements. Representatives of banks stated that the proposed requirements were duplicative of existing requirements. Representatives of nonbank creditors and brokers argued that the proposal was too lenient, would allow for unqualified loan originators to work at depository institutions, and would create an unfair competitive advantage for these institutions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Post-Proposal Outreach</HD>
          <P>After the proposal was issued, the Bureau held roundtable meetings with other Federal banking and housing regulators, consumer groups, and industry representatives to discuss the proposal and the final rule. At the Bureau's request, many of the participants provided feedback, which the Bureau has considered in preparing the final rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Other Rulemakings</HD>
          <P>In addition to this final rule, the Bureau is adopting several other final rules and issuing one proposal, all relating to mortgage credit to implement requirements of title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is also issuing a final rule jointly with other Federal agencies to implement requirements for mortgage appraisals in title XIV. Each of the final rules follows a proposal issued in 2011 by the Board or in 2012 by the Bureau alone or jointly with other Federal agencies. Collectively, these proposed and final rules are referred to as the Title XIV Rulemakings.</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Ability to Repay:</E>The Bureau recently issued a rule, following a May 2011 proposal issued by the Board (the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal), 76 FR 27390 (May 11, 2011), to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (1) requiring creditors to determine that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay covered mortgage loans and establishing standards for compliance, such as by making a &#x201C;qualified mortgage,&#x201D; and (2) establishing certain limitations on prepayment penalties, pursuant to TILA section 129C as established by Dodd-Frank Act sections 1411, 1412, and 1414. 15 U.S.C. 1639c. The Bureau's final rule is referred to as the 2013 ATR Final Rule. Simultaneously with the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau issued a proposal to amend the final rule implementing the ability-to-repay requirements, including by the addition of exemptions for certain nonprofit creditors and certain homeownership stabilization programs and a definition of a &#x201C;qualified mortgage&#x201D; for certain loans made and held in portfolio by small creditors (the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal). The Bureau expects to act on the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal on an expedited basis, so that any exceptions or adjustments to the 2013 ATR Final Rule can take effect simultaneously with that rule.</P>
          <P>&#x2022;<E T="03">Escrows:</E>The Bureau recently issued a rule, following a March 2011 proposal issued by the Board (the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal), 76 FR 11598 (Mar. 2, 2011), to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act expanding on existing rules that require escrow accounts to be established for higher-priced mortgage loans and creating an exemption for certain loans held by creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas, pursuant to TILA section 129D as established by Dodd-Frank Act sections 1461. 15 U.S.C. 1639d. The Bureau's final rule is referred to as the 2013 Escrows Final Rule.</P>

The Bureau recently issued rules to implement certain title XIV requirements concerning homeownership counseling, including a<PRTPAGE P="11290"/>requirement that lenders provide lists of homeownership counselors to applicants for federally related mortgage loans, pursuant to RESPA section 5(c), as amended by Dodd-Frank Act section 1450. 12 U.S.C. 2604(c).

The Bureau also recently finalized rules on early intervention for troubled and delinquent borrowers, and loss mitigation procedures, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 6 of RESPA, as amended by Dodd-Frank Act section 1463, to establish obligations for mortgage servicers that it finds to be appropriate to carry out the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, and its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to prescribe rules necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. The Bureau's final rule under RESPA with respect to mortgage servicing also establishes requirements for general servicing standards policies and procedures and continuity of contact pursuant to its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA.

This rule follows the agencies' August 2012 joint proposal (the 2012 Interagency Appraisals Proposal). 77 FR 54722 (Sept. 5, 2012). The agencies' joint final rule is referred to as the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule. In addition, following its August 2012 proposal (the 2012 ECOA Appraisals Proposal), 77 FR 50390 (Aug. 21, 2012), the Bureau is issuing a final rule to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring that creditors provide applicants with a free copy of written appraisals and valuations developed in connection with applications for loans secured by a first lien on a dwelling, pursuant to section 701(e) of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) as amended by Dodd-Frank Act section 1474. 15 U.S.C. 1691(e).

          </FTNT>
          <P>The Bureau is not at this time finalizing proposals concerning various disclosure requirements that were added by title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, integration of mortgage disclosures under TILA and RESPA, or a simpler, more inclusive definition of the finance charge for purposes of disclosures for closed-end mortgage transactions under Regulation Z. The Bureau expects to finalize these proposals and to consider whether to adjust regulatory thresholds under the Title XIV Rulemakings in connection with any change in the calculation of the finance charge later in 2013, after it has completed quantitative testing, and any additional qualitative testing deemed appropriate, of the forms that it proposed in July 2012 to combine TILA mortgage disclosures with the good faith estimate (RESPA GFE) and settlement statement (RESPA settlement statement) required under RESPA, pursuant to Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(f) and sections 4(a) of RESPA and 105(b) of TILA, as amended by Dodd-Frank Act sections 1098 and 1100A, respectively (the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal). 77 FR 51116 (Aug. 23, 2012). Accordingly, the Bureau already has issued a final rule delaying implementation of various affected title XIV disclosure provisions. 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012). The Bureau's approaches to coordinating the implementation of the Title XIV Rulemakings and to the finance charge proposal are discussed in turn below.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Coordinated Implementation of Title XIV Rulemakings</HD>

          <P>As noted in all of its foregoing proposals, the Bureau regards each of the Title XIV Rulemakings as affecting aspects of the mortgage industry and its regulations. Accordingly, as noted in its proposals, the Bureau is coordinating carefully the Title XIV Rulemakings, particularly with respect to their effective dates. The Dodd-Frank Act requirements to be implemented by the Title XIV Rulemakings generally will take effect on January 21, 2013, unless final rules implementing those requirements are issued on or before that date and provide for a different effective date.<E T="03">See</E>Dodd-Frank Act section 1400(c), 15 U.S.C. 1601 note. In addition, some of the Title XIV Rulemakings are to take effect no later than one year after they are issued.<E T="03">Id.</E>
          </P>
          <P>The comments on the appropriate implementation date for this final rule are discussed in detail below in part VI of this notice. In general, however, consumer groups requested that the Bureau put the protections in the Title XIV Rulemakings into effect as soon as practicable. In contrast, the Bureau received some industry comments indicating that implementing so many new requirements at the same time would create a significant cumulative burden for creditors. In addition, many commenters also acknowledged the advantages of implementing multiple revisions to the regulations in a coordinated fashion.<SU>52</SU>
            <FTREF/>Thus, a tension exists between coordinating the adoption of the Title XIV Rulemakings and facilitating industry's implementation of such a large set of new requirements. Some have suggested that the Bureau resolve this tension by adopting a sequenced implementation, while others have requested that the Bureau simply provide a longer implementation period for all of the final rules.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>52</SU>Of the several final rules being adopted under the Title XIV Rulemakings, six entail amendments to Regulation Z, with the only exceptions being the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule (Regulation X) and the 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule (Regulation B); the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule also amends Regulation X, in addition to Regulation Z. The six Regulation Z final rules involve numerous instances of intersecting provisions, either by cross-references to each other's provisions or by adopting parallel provisions. Thus, adopting some of those amendments without also adopting certain other, closely related provisions would create significant technical issues,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>new provisions containing cross-references to other provisions that do not yet exist, which could undermine the ability of creditors and other parties subject to the rules to understand their obligations and implement appropriate systems changes in an integrated and efficient manner.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The Bureau recognizes that many of the new provisions will require creditors and loan originators to make changes to automated systems and, further, that most administrators of large systems are reluctant to make too many changes to their systems at once. At the same time, however, the Bureau notes that the Dodd-Frank Act established virtually all of these changes to institutions' compliance responsibilities, and contemplated that they be implemented in a relatively short period of time. And, as already noted, the extent of interaction among<PRTPAGE P="11291"/>many of the Title XIV Rulemakings necessitates that many of their provisions take effect together. Finally, notwithstanding commenters' expressed concerns for cumulative burden, the Bureau expects that creditors and loan originators actually may realize some efficiencies from adapting their systems for compliance with multiple new, closely related requirements at once, especially if given sufficient overall time to do so.</P>

          <P>Accordingly, the Bureau is requiring that, as a general matter, creditors, loan originators, and other affected persons begin complying with the final rules on January 10, 2014. As noted above, section 1400(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that some provisions of the Title XIV Rulemakings take effect no later than one year after the Bureau issues them. Accordingly, the Bureau is establishing January 10, 2014, one year after issuance of the Bureau's 2013 ATR, Escrows, and HOEPA Final Rules (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the earliest of the title XIV final rules), as the baseline effective date for most of the Title XIV Rulemakings. The Bureau believes that, on balance, this approach will facilitate the implementation of the rules' overlapping provisions, while also affording creditors sufficient time to implement the more complex or resource-intensive new requirements.</P>

          <P>The Bureau has identified certain rulemakings or selected aspects thereof, however, that do not present significant implementation burdens for industry, including &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and (i) of this final rule. Accordingly, the Bureau is setting earlier effective dates for these paragraphs and certain other final rules or aspects thereof, as applicable. The effective dates for this final rule are set forth and explained in part VI. The effective dates for the other final rules are discussed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices for those rules.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">More Inclusive Finance Charge Proposal</HD>
          <P>As noted above, the Bureau proposed in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal to make the definition of finance charge more inclusive, thus rendering the finance charge and annual percentage rate a more useful tool for consumers to compare the cost of credit across different alternatives. 77 FR 51116, 51143 (Aug. 23, 2012). Because the new definition would include additional costs that are not currently counted, it would cause the finance charges and APRs on many affected transactions to increase. This in turn could cause more such transactions to become subject to various compliance regimes under Regulation Z. Specifically, the finance charge is central to the calculation of a transaction's &#x201C;points and fees,&#x201D; which in turn has been (and remains) a coverage threshold for the special protections afforded &#x201C;high-cost mortgages&#x201D; under HOEPA. Points and fees also will be subject to a 3-percent limit for purposes of determining whether a transaction is a &#x201C;qualified mortgage&#x201D; under the 2013 ATR Final Rule. Meanwhile, the APR serves as a coverage threshold for HOEPA protections as well as for certain protections afforded &#x201C;higher-priced mortgage loans&#x201D; under &#xA7; 1026.35, including the mandatory escrow account requirements being amended by the 2013 Escrows Final Rule. Finally, because the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule uses the same APR-based coverage test as is used for identifying higher-priced mortgage loans, the APR affects that rulemaking as well. Thus, the proposed more inclusive finance charge would have had the indirect effect of increasing coverage under HOEPA and the escrow and appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, as well as decreasing the number of transactions that may be qualified mortgages&#x2014;even holding actual loan terms constant&#x2014;simply because of the increase in calculated finance charges, and consequently APRs, for closed-end mortgage transactions generally.</P>
          <P>As noted above, these expanded coverage consequences were not the intent of the more inclusive finance charge proposal. Accordingly, as discussed more extensively in the Escrows Proposal, the HOEPA Proposal, the ATR Proposal, and the Interagency Appraisals Proposal, the Board and subsequently the Bureau (and other agencies) sought comment on certain adjustments to the affected regulatory thresholds to counteract this unintended effect. First, the Board and then the Bureau proposed to adopt a &#x201C;transaction coverage rate&#x201D; for use as the metric to determine coverage of these regimes in place of the APR. The transaction coverage rate would have been calculated solely for coverage determination purposes and would not have been disclosed to consumers, who still would have received only a disclosure of the expanded APR. The transaction coverage rate calculation would exclude from the prepaid finance charge all costs otherwise included for purposes of the APR calculation except charges retained by the creditor, any mortgage broker, or any affiliate of either. Similarly, the Board and Bureau proposed to reverse the effects of the more inclusive finance charge on the calculation of points and fees; the points and fees figure is calculated only as a HOEPA and qualified mortgage coverage metric and is not disclosed to consumers. The Bureau also sought comment on other potential mitigation measures, such as adjusting the numeric thresholds for particular compliance regimes to account for the general shift in affected transactions' APRs.</P>
          <P>The Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal sought comment on whether to finalize the more inclusive finance charge proposal in conjunction with the Title XIV Rulemakings or with the rest of the TILA-RESPA Proposal concerning the integration of mortgage disclosure forms. 77 FR 51116, 51125 (Aug. 23, 2012). Upon additional consideration and review of comments received, the Bureau decided to defer a decision whether to adopt the more inclusive finance charge proposal and any related adjustments to regulatory thresholds until it later finalizes the TILA-RESPA Proposal. 77 FR 54843 (Sept. 6, 2012); 77 FR 54844 (Sept. 6, 2012).<SU>53</SU>
            <FTREF/>Accordingly, the 2013 Escrows, HOEPA, ATR, and Interagency Appraisals Final Rules all are deferring any action on their respective proposed adjustments to regulatory thresholds.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>53</SU>These notices extended the comment period on the more inclusive finance charge and corresponding regulatory threshold adjustments under the 2012 TILA-RESPA and HOEPA Proposals. They did not change any other aspect of either proposal.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Legal Authority</HD>

          <P>On July 21, 2011, section 1061 of the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Bureau the &#x201C;consumer financial protection functions&#x201D; previously vested in certain other Federal agencies, including the Board. The term &#x201C;consumer financial protection function&#x201D; is defined to include &#x201C;all authority to prescribe rules or issue orders or guidelines pursuant to any Federal consumer financial law, including performing appropriate functions to promulgate and review such rules, orders, and guidelines.&#x201D; 12 U.S.C. 5581(a)(1). TILA is a Federal consumer financial law. Dodd-Frank Act section 1002(14), 12 U.S.C. 5481(14) (defining &#x201C;Federal consumer financial law&#x201D; to include the &#x201C;enumerated consumer laws&#x201D; and the provisions of title X of the Dodd-Frank Act); Dodd-Frank Act section 1002(12), 12 U.S.C. 5481(12) (defining &#x201C;enumerated consumer laws&#x201D; to include TILA). Accordingly, the Bureau has authority to issue regulations pursuant to TILA. This final rule is issued on January 20, 2013, in accordance with 12 CFR 1074.1.<PRTPAGE P="11292"/>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">TILA Section 103(cc)(2)(E)(v)</HD>
          <P>As added by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 103(cc)(2)(E)(v), 15 U.S.C. 1602(cc)(2)(E)(v) authorizes the Bureau to prescribe other criteria that seller financers need to meet, aside from those enumerated in the statute, to qualify for the seller financer exclusion from the definition of the term &#x201C;mortgage originator. The Bureau's exercise of that authority is discussed in the section-by-section analysis of the seller financer exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">TILA Section 105(a)</HD>
          <P>As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 105(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), directs the Bureau to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA, and provides that such regulations may contain additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, that the Bureau judges are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance. The purpose of TILA is &#x201C;to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.&#x201D; TILA section 102(a); 15 U.S.C. 1601(a). These stated purposes are tied to Congress's finding that &#x201C;economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit.&#x201D; TILA section 102(a). Thus, strengthened competition among financial institutions is a goal of TILA, achieved through the effectuation of TILA's purposes. In addition, TILA section 129B(a)(2) establishes a purpose of TILA sections 129B and 129C to &#x201C;assure consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive or abusive.&#x201D; 15 U.S.C. 1639b(a)(2).</P>
          <P>Historically, TILA section 105(a) has served as a broad source of authority for rules that promote the informed use of credit through required disclosures and substantive regulation of certain practices. However, Dodd-Frank Act section 1100A clarified the Bureau's section 105(a) authority by amending that section to provide express authority to prescribe regulations that contain &#x201C;additional requirements&#x201D; that the Bureau finds are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance. This amendment clarified the authority to exercise TILA section 105(a) to prescribe requirements beyond those specifically listed in the statute that meet the standards outlined in section 105(a). The Dodd-Frank Act also clarified the Bureau's rulemaking authority over certain high-cost mortgages pursuant to section 105(a). As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau's TILA section 105(a) authority to make adjustments and exceptions to the requirements of TILA applies to all transactions subject to TILA, except with respect to the substantive protections of TILA section 129, 15 U.S.C. 1639,<SU>54</SU>
            <FTREF/>which apply to the high-cost mortgages referred to in TILA section 103(bb), 15 U.S.C. 1602(bb).</P>

            <P>
              <SU>54</SU>TILA section 129 contains requirements for certain high-cost mortgages, established by HOEPA, which are commonly called HOEPA loans.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>This final rule implements the Dodd-Frank Act requirements and establishes such additional requirements, adjustments, and exceptions as, in the Bureau's judgment, are necessary and proper to carry out the purposes of TILA, prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance. In developing these aspects of the final rule pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a), the Bureau has considered the purposes of TILA, including ensuring meaningful disclosures, facilitating consumers' ability to compare credit terms, and helping consumers avoid the uninformed use of credit, as well as ensuring consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive or abusive. In developing this final rule and using its authority under TILA section 105(a), the Bureau also has considered the findings of TILA, including strengthening competition among financial institutions and promoting economic stabilization.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">TILA Section 129B(c)</HD>
          <P>Dodd-Frank Act section 1403 amended TILA section 129B by imposing two limitations on loan originator compensation to reduce or eliminate steering incentives for residential mortgage loans.<SU>55</SU>
            <FTREF/>15 U.S.C. 1639b(c). First, it generally prohibits loan originators from receiving compensation for any residential mortgage loan that varies based on the terms of the loan, other than the amount of the principal. Second, TILA section 129B generally allows only consumers to compensate loan originators, though an exception permits other persons to pay &#x201C;an origination fee or charge&#x201D; to a loan originator, but only if two conditions are met: (1) The loan originator does not receive any compensation directly from a consumer; and (2) the consumer does not make an upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees (other than bona fide third-party fees that are not retained by the creditor, the loan originator, or the affiliates of either). The Bureau has authority to prescribe regulations to prohibit the above practices. In addition, TILA section 129B(c)(2)(B)(ii) authorizes the Bureau to create exemptions from the exception's second prerequisite, that the consumer must not make any upfront payments of points or fees, where the Bureau determines that doing so &#x201C;is in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.&#x201D;</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>55</SU>Section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act also added new TILA section 129B(c)(3), which requires the Bureau to prescribe regulations to prohibit certain kinds of steering, abusive or unfair lending practices, mischaracterization of credit histories or appraisals, and discouraging consumers from shopping with other mortgage originators. 15 U.S.C. 1639b(c)(3). This final rule does not address those provisions. Because they are structured as a requirement that the Bureau prescribe regulations establishing the substantive prohibitions, notwithstanding Dodd-Frank Act section 1400(c)(3), 15 U.S.C. 1601 note, the Bureau believes that the substantive prohibitions cannot take effect until the regulations establishing them have been prescribed and taken effect. The Bureau intends to prescribe such regulations in a future rulemaking. Until such time, no obligations are imposed on mortgage originators or other persons under TILA section 129B(c)(3).</P>

In particular, TILA section 129(p)(2), as redesignated by Dodd-Frank Act section 1433(a) and amended by Dodd-Frank Act section 1100A, requires the Bureau to prohibit, by regulation or order, acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of HOEPA. 15 U.S.C. 1639(p)(2). Likewise, TILA requires the Bureau to prohibit, by regulation or order, acts or practices in connection with the refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the consumer.<E T="03">Id.</E>
          </P>

          <P>The authority granted to the Bureau under TILA section 129(p)(2) is broad.<PRTPAGE P="11293"/>It reaches mortgage loans with rates and fees that do not meet HOEPA's rate or fee trigger in TILA section 103(bb), 15 U.S.C. 1602(bb), as well as mortgage loans not covered under that section. TILA section 129(p)(2) is not limited to acts or practices by creditors, or to loan terms or lending practices.</P>

          <P>Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(a) amended TILA to add new section 129B(e), 15 U.S.C. 1639b(e). That section, as amended by Dodd-Frank Act section 1100A, provides for the Bureau to prohibit or condition terms, acts, or practices relating to residential mortgage loans on a variety of bases, including when the Bureau finds the terms, acts, or practices are not in the interest of the consumer. In developing proposed rules under TILA section 129B(e), the Bureau has considered all of the bases for its authority set forth in that section.</P>

          <P>Dodd-Frank Act section 1414(a) amended TILA to add new section 129C(e), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(e). That section restricts mandatory arbitration agreements in residential mortgage loans and extensions of open-end credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. It also prohibits provisions of these loans and related agreements from being applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a Federal claim in court.

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Final Rule</HD>

          <P>This final rule implements new TILA sections 129B(b)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2) and 129C(d) and (e), as added by sections 1402, 1403, and 1414(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of &#xA7; 1026.36(f) and (g), TILA section 129B(b)(1) requires each mortgage originator to be qualified and include unique identification numbers on loan documents. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1) and (2), TILA section 129B(c)(1) and (2) prohibits &#x201C;mortgage originators&#x201D; in &#x201C;residential mortgage loans&#x201D; from receiving compensation that varies based on loan terms and from receiving origination charges or fees from persons other than the consumer except in certain circumstances. Additionally, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of &#xA7; 1026.36(i), TILA section 129C(d) creates prohibitions on single-premium credit insurance. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of &#xA7; 1026.36(h), TILA section 129C(e) provides restrictions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims. Finally, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of &#xA7; 1026.36(j), TILA section 129B(b)(2), requires the Bureau to prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor the compliance of such depository institutions, the subsidiaries of such institutions, and the employees of such institutions or subsidiaries with the requirements of TILA section 129B and the registration procedures established under section 1507 of the SAFE Act, 12 U.S.C. 5101<E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(h) Prohibition on Mandatory Arbitration Clauses and Waivers of Certain Consumer Rights</HD>

          <P>Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added TILA section 129C(e)(1), which prohibits a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or an extension of open-end consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling from containing terms that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for<PRTPAGE P="11387"/>resolving disputes arising out of the transaction. TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that, subject to TILA section 129C(e)(3) a consumer and creditor or any assignee may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may be applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law.</P>
          <P>The Bureau proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(h) to implement these statutory provisions, pursuant to TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(h)(2) would have clarified the interaction between TILA sections 129C(e)(2) and (e)(3), and the section-by-section analysis noted that TILA section 129C(e)(3) and &#xA7; 1026.36(h)(2) do not address State law causes of action.</P>
          <P>Commenters generally supported the proposal. Although some commenters addressed details of the substance of the proposal, many commenters addressed the timing of the provisions' implementation. For example, several consumer groups stated that the proposal did not make any substantive changes to the statutory provisions and should be withdrawn because there was no reason to delay the effective date of the statutory provisions. One commenter acknowledged that the provisions were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act but urged the Bureau to encourage mandatory arbitration anyway. SBA Advocacy stated that some Small Entity Representatives did not understand why the provisions were being included in this rule and asked the Bureau to consider adopting it at a later date. A bank association commenter urged the Bureau to delay the provisions until after it completed its required general study of arbitration clauses in consumer transactions, pursuant to section 1028 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>
          <P>One commenter requested clarification on whether the provisions apply to waivers of rights to a jury trial. Other commenters questioned variously whether the proposal altered the statutory provisions: By applying the provision on waivers of causes of action to post-dispute agreements; by applying that provision to loans other than residential mortgage loans and open-end consumer credit plans secured by a principal dwelling; by limiting it to Federal causes of action; or by prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts and agreements other than the note and agreements related to the note. One commenter stated that the applicability of the proposed rule provisions was confusing because the provisions refer to consumer transactions secured by a dwelling but their scope is also addressed separately in proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(j). (Proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(j) is finalized as &#xA7; 1026.36(b) of the rule.) Finally, one commenter suggested that the statute and the rule would prohibit nonjudicial foreclosures and prevent a servicer from settling a dispute with a consumer through a settlement agreement.</P>
          <P>The provisions on mandatory arbitration and waiver are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent action by the Bureau, they would take effect on January 21, 2013. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to provide implementing language to facilitate compliance with the statute. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes the point made by several commenters regarding the importance of these consumer protections. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provisions by regulation does not require the Bureau to delay the provisions' effective date for an extended period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of these statutory protections within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period because the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims have been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, and this final rule will not require extensive changes to origination systems. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not accept loans that require arbitration or other nonjudicial procedures to resolve disputes, so the Bureau believes this aspect of the statute and final rule will not necessitate significant changes to current practices in most circumstances. The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, in order to provide industry a short period to make any needed adjustments.</P>
          <P>In response to the comments, the Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit waivers of rights to a jury trial because bench trials are judicial procedures, not nonjudicial procedures. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(1) to limit deeds of trust providing for nonjudicial foreclosure because such instruments are not agreements to use nonjudicial procedures to resolve controversies or settle claims arising out of the transaction, in contrast with agreements to use arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Nor does the Bureau interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit nonjudicial foreclosures because nonjudicial foreclosures still allow consumers to bring actions in court alleging violations of Federal law.</P>
          <P>Similarly, the Bureau does not interpret the statute to bar settlement agreements. Such a result would be a highly unusual&#x2014;perhaps unprecedented&#x2014;prohibition, and the Bureau believes that Congress would have spoken expressly about settlement agreements if that was the result it intended.<SU>157</SU>
            <FTREF/>Instead, the Bureau reads the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to settle the dispute or claim, the settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the regulatory text to clarify that &#xA7; 1026.36(h) does not limit a consumer and creditor or any assignee from agreeing, after a dispute or claim under the transaction arises, to settle that dispute or claim. Under TILA section 129C(e)(3) and &#xA7; 1026.36(h)(2), however, no settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>157</SU>
              <E T="03">See, e.g., Robinson</E>v.<E T="03">Shelby Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,</E>566 F.3d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 2009) (&#x201C;[I]t is also well-established that `[p]ublic policy strongly favors settlement of disputes without litigation. * * * Settlement agreements should therefore be upheld whenever equitable and policy considerations so permit.'&#x201D;).</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The Bureau is further revising the regulatory text to address the belief of some commenters that the Bureau had altered the scope of the statutory provision. As discussed above, TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that the exception for post-dispute agreements from the prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements is itself subject to the prohibition on waivers of rights to bring Federal causes of action in court. The proposal specified that a post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure could not limit the ability of the consumer to bring a covered claim through the agreed-upon procedure. This final rule clarifies that, consistent with the discussion of waivers of causes of action in settlement<PRTPAGE P="11388"/>agreements above, the Bureau interprets the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure to resolve that dispute or claim, the agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring<E T="03">that</E>dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. The Bureau believes that, in such an instance, the consumer is aware of the specific dispute or claim at issue and is therefore in a better position to make a knowing decision whether to resolve the dispute or claim without bringing an action in court. But no post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</P>
          <P>The Bureau disagrees with commenters who stated it had expanded the scope of TILA section 129C(e) to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. Proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(j) (implemented in this final rule as &#xA7; 1026.36(b)) clarifies the scope of each of the other substantive paragraphs in &#xA7; 1026.36 and provides that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which &#xA7; 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. However, to reduce uncertainty, the Bureau is including a statement in &#xA7; 1026.36(h) that it is applicable to &#x201C;a home equity line of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.&#x201D;</P>
          <P>The Bureau also disagrees that the proposed language changed the scope of the prohibition on waivers of causes of action by including the word &#x201C;Federal&#x201D; in the paragraph (h)(2) heading, &#x201C;No waivers of Federal statutory causes of action.&#x201D; The contents of paragraph (h)(2) and the corresponding statutory paragraph (e)(3) both provide that the prohibition applies to alleged violations of Section 129C of TILA, any other provision of TILA, or any other Federal law. Thus, the scope of the statutory prohibition is limited to Federal law, and the implementing regulation is properly so limited.</P>
          <P>Finally, the Bureau disagrees that the prohibition on agreements to use mandatory arbitration applies only to the note itself. TILA section 129C(e)(1) provides that it applies to the terms of a residential mortgage loan and to an extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. The terms of such transactions are frequently memorialized in multiple documents. Plainly, the prohibition cannot be evaded simply by including a provision for mandatory arbitration in a document other than the note if that document is executed as part of the transaction. The prohibition applies to the terms of the whole transaction, regardless of which particular document contains those terms. However, to prevent any misunderstanding that the prohibition applies to agreements that are not part of the credit transaction, the Bureau is replacing the phrase &#x201C;contract or agreement in connection with a&#x201D; consumer credit transaction with the phrase &#x201C;contract or other agreement for&#x201D; a consumer credit transaction.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Effective Date</HD>
          <P>The amendments to &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and (i) of this final rule are effective on June 1, 2013. The rule applies to transactions for which the creditor received an application on or after that date. All other provisions of the rule are effective on January 10, 2014. As discussed above in part III.G, the Bureau believes that this approach is consistent with the timeframes established in section 1400(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act and, on balance, will facilitate the implementation of the rules' overlapping provisions, while also affording creditors sufficient time to implement the more complex or resource-intensive new requirements.</P>
          <P>In the proposal, the Bureau recognized that this rulemaking addresses issues important for consumer protection and thus should be implemented as soon as practical. The Bureau also recognized, however, that creditors and loan originators will need time to make systems changes, establish appropriate policies and procedures, and retrain their staff to address the Dodd-Frank Act provisions and other requirements implemented through this rulemaking. The Bureau stated that ensuring that industry has sufficient time to properly implement the necessary changes will inure to the benefit of consumer through better industry compliance, and solicited comment on an appropriate implementation period for the final rule in light of these competing considerations.</P>
          <P>In response to the proposal, the Bureau received approximately 20 comments from industry participants with respect to the appropriate effective date for the requirements in the proposed rule. The majority of commenters, including large and small banks, credit unions, non-depository creditors, and State and national trade associations, requested that the Bureau provide the industry with ample time to implement the requirements of the final rule, but did not suggest a specific effective date or timeframe. For example, one State trade association representing banks and a mortgage company did not propose a specific effective date, but urged the Bureau to carefully consider the challenges involved with implementing such massive changes and to make every effort to avoid significant adverse impact on consumers, creditor, and the economy as a whole. Two commenters also noted that their software vendors were concerned about their ability to meet potential effective dates. A State trade association representing credit unions expressed concern about the number of changes required by the rule and suggested that the Bureau delay the effective date until all of the related proposals have been finalized. Further, another trade association representing credit unions stated that, if credit unions were not exempt from the new regulations, the Bureau should apply maximum flexibility in determining the implementation and effective dates of the final rule.</P>
          <P>For commenters requesting a specific date for implementation, the time periods suggested ranged from 12 to 36 months. One large and one small credit union indicated that the Bureau should establish an implementation period of 18 months, while a leading industry trade association and a large bank advocated for an effective date of 18 to 24 months and 24 months, respectively. Further, one trade association representing manufactured housing providers requested that the Bureau use its authority to extend the effective date to the greatest extent possible and suggested an implementation date of up to 36 or 48 months after issuance of the rule. Each of the commenters generally stated that the requested time was necessary to effectively implement the regulations because of the complexity of the proposed rules, the impact on systems changes and staff training, and the cumulative impact of the proposed loan originator compensation rules when combined with other requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act or proposed by the Bureau. One major trade association referred to the complexity faced by HUD in implementing the RESPA reform rules from 2009 to 2011 and urged the Bureau to provide industry with an opportunity to review the rule and have uncertainties and ambiguities addressed before the implementation period begins. Similarly, another bank recommended that the Bureau establish an internal group to respond to industry questions and concerns regarding implementation.</P>

          <P>The Bureau received three comments specifically regarding the effective date for &#xA7; 1026.36(g), which requires the loan originator's name and NMLSR ID on all loan documents. One trade association requested that the Bureau delay the effective date for including the NMLSR IDs on forms until the rule implementing the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosure forms takes effect. The commenter urged that a delayed effective date would eliminate unnecessary costs for creditor to update the technology related to disclosures for this rule and then again once the new integrated disclosures are finalized. A large bank stated that the new NMLSR ID requirement, if adopted, should become effective no sooner than January 2014 to provide industry with enough time to make document forms and system changes. The bank commenter also recommended that a 12-month implementation period may not be adequate if banks do not timely receive<PRTPAGE P="11391"/>updated note and security interest forms supplied by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (&#x201C;GSEs&#x201D;) and federal agencies. One information services company did not propose a timeframe, but sought clarification of the effective date to ensure consistency across the industry.</P>
          <P>Additionally, the Bureau received two comments from consumer groups specifically regarding the effective date of the ban on mandatory arbitration clauses in &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and certain financing practices for single-premium credit insurance in &#xA7; 1026.36(i). One of the consumer groups stated that the proposed regulation adds little to the statutory requirements and, thus, should take effect no later than January 21, 2013. The other consumer group did not propose a specific implementation date, but stated generally that the ban on mandatory arbitration clauses in section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act should be implemented immediately.</P>
          <P>For the reasons already discussed above, the Bureau believes that an effective date of January 10, 2014 for most of the other title XIV final rules and all provisions of this final rule except &#xA7; 1026.36(h) regarding mandatory arbitration and waivers of federal claims and &#xA7; 1026.36(i) regarding certain financing practices for single-premium credit insurance will ensure that consumers receive the protections in these rules as soon as reasonably practicable. These effective dates take into account the timeframes established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the need for a coordinated approach to facilitate implementation of the rules' overlapping provisions, and the need to afford loan originators, creditors and other affected entities sufficient time to implement the more complex or resource-intensive new requirements. Accordingly, except for &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and (i), the effective date for implementation of the regulations adopted in this notice is January 10, 2014. This time period is consistent with: (1) The request for the majority of comments for an ample amount of time to implement the requirements: (2) outreach conducted by the Bureau with vendors and systems providers regarding timeframes for updating core systems: and (3) the implementation period for other requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act or regulations issued by the Bureau that may have a cumulative impact on loan originators and creditors. Although some commenters requested a longer time period to come into compliance with this rule, the Bureau believes that the implementation period adopted appropriately balances the need of industry to have a sufficient amount of time to bring their systems and practices into compliance with the goal of providing consumers the benefits of these new protections as soon as practical.</P>
          <P>With respect to the Dodd-Frank Act's ban on mandatory arbitration clauses, waivers of Federal claims, and certain financing practices for single-premium credit insurance, the Bureau agrees with commenters that these requirements should be implemented without further delay. Accordingly, the requirements banning mandatory arbitration clauses, waivers of Federal claims, and certain financing practices for single-premium credit insurance in &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and (i) take effect June 1, 2013. Thus, compliance with these provisions of this final rule will be mandatory nearly eight months earlier than the January 21, 2014 baseline mandatory compliance date that the Bureau is adopting for the other parts of this final rule and most of the Title XIV Rulemakings, as discussed above in part III.G. As that discussion notes, the Bureau is carefully coordinating the implementation of the Title XIV Rulemakings, including their mandatory compliance dates. The Bureau is including &#xA7; 1026.36(h) and (i) of this final rule, however, among a subset of the new requirements of the Title XIV Rulemakings that will have earlier effective dates because the Bureau believes that they do not present significant implementation burdens for industry.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Dodd-Frank Act Section 1022(b)(2)</HD>
          <P>In developing the final rule, the Bureau has considered potential benefits, costs, and impacts.<SU>159</SU>
            <FTREF/>The proposed rule set forth a preliminary analysis of these effects, and the Bureau requested and received comments on this analysis. In addition, the Bureau has consulted or offered to consult with the prudential regulators, HUD, the FHFA, and the Federal Trade Commission, including regarding consistency with any prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>159</SU>Specifically, section 1022(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act calls for the Bureau to consider the potential benefits and costs of a regulation to consumers and covered persons, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services; the impact on depository institutions and credit unions with $10 billion or less in total assets as described in section 1026 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and the impact on consumers in rural areas.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In this rulemaking, the Bureau amends Regulation Z to implement amendments to TILA made by the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendments to Regulation Z implement certain provisions in Dodd-Frank Act sections 1402 (new duties of mortgage originators concerning proper qualification, registration, and related requirements), 1403 (limitations on loan originator compensation to reduce steering incentives for residential mortgage loans), and 1414(a) (restrictions on the financing of single-premium credit insurance products and mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims in residential mortgage loan transactions). The final rule also provides clarification of certain provisions in the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule, including the application of those provisions to certain profit-based compensation plans and the appropriate analysis of other payments made to loan originators.</P>
          <P>The Board and Congress acted in 2010, as discussed in Part II above, to address concerns that certain methods of compensating loan originators could create potential moral hazard in the residential mortgage market, creating incentives for originators to persuade consumers to agree to loan terms, such as higher interest rates, that are more profitable to originators but detrimental to consumers. The final rule will continue the protections provided in the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule while implementing additional provisions Congress included in the Dodd-Frank Act that, as discussed previously, improve the transparency of mortgage loan originations, preserve consumer choice and access to credit, and enhance the ability of consumers to accurately interpret and select among the alternative loan terms available to them.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Provisions To Be Analyzed</HD>
          <P>The analysis below considers the benefits, costs, and impacts of the following major provisions:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">1.</E>A complete exemption, pursuant to Dodd-Frank Act section 1403 and other authority, from the statutory prohibition in section 1403 on consumers paying upfront points and fees in all loan transactions where a loan originator receives compensation from someone other than a consumer for that particular transaction.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">2.</E>Clarification of the applicability of the prohibition on payment and receipt of loan originator compensation based on transaction terms to compensation by creditors or loan originator organizations through designated tax-advantaged plans in which individual loan originators participate and to payment of non-deferred profits-based compensation.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">3.</E>New requirements for loan originators, including requirements related to their licensing, registration, and qualifications, and a requirement to<PRTPAGE P="11392"/>include their identification numbers and names on loan documents.</P>
          <P>The prohibition of mandatory arbitration clauses and waivers of Federal claims in residential mortgage contracts and restrictions on the financing of single-premium credit insurance are also discussed.</P>
          <P>The analysis considers the benefits and costs to consumers and covered persons from each of these provisions. The analysis also addresses comments the Bureau received on the proposed 1022(b)(2) analysis as well as certain other comments on the benefits or costs of provisions of the proposed rule when doing so is helpful to understanding the section 1022(b)(2) analysis. Comments that mention the benefits or costs of a provision of the rule in the context of commenting on the merits of that provision are addressed in the section-by-section analysis for that provision. The analysis also addresses the benefits, costs, and impacts of certain alternative provisions that were considered by the Bureau in the development of the final rule, including in response to comments. Broader and more detailed discussions of these alternative provisions, including the requirement to make available to the consumer an alternative loan that would not include discount points, origination points, or origination fees and the use of a revenue test to determine circumstances under which loan originators may receive certain compensation on the basis of profits from mortgage origination activities, can also be found in the section-by-section analysis above.</P>
          <P>As noted, section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Bureau, in adopting the rule, consider potential benefits and costs to consumers and covered persons resulting from the rule, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services resulting from the rule, as noted above; it also requires the Bureau to consider the impact of proposed rules on covered persons and the impact on consumers in rural areas. These potential benefits and costs, and these impacts, however, are not generally susceptible to particularized or definitive calculation in connection with this rule. The incidence and scope of such potential benefits and costs, and such impacts, will be influenced very substantially by economic cycles, market developments, and business and consumer choices that are substantially independent from adoption of the rule. No commenter has advanced data or methodology that it claims would enable precise calculation of these benefits, costs, or impacts. Moreover, the potential benefits of the rule on consumers and covered persons in creating market changes anticipated to address market failures are especially hard to quantify.</P>
          <P>In considering the relevant potential benefits, costs, and impacts, the Bureau has utilized the available data discussed in this preamble, where the Bureau has found it informative, and applied its knowledge and expertise concerning consumer financial markets, potential business and consumer choices, and economic analyses that it regards as most reliable and helpful, to consider the relevant potential benefits and costs, and relevant impacts. The data relied upon by the Bureau includes the public comment record established by the proposed rule.<SU>160</SU>
            <FTREF/>However, the Bureau notes that for some aspects of this analysis, there are limited data available with which to quantify the potential costs, benefits, and impacts of the final rule. The absence of public data regarding the specific distribution of loan products offered to consumers, for example, eliminates the ability to estimate precisely any empirical benefits from increased consumer choice.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>160</SU>The Bureau noted in the mortgage proposals issued in summer 2012 that it sought to obtain additional data to supplement its consideration of the rulemakings, including additional data from the National Mortgage License System (NMLS) and the NMLS Mortgage Call Report, loan file extracts from various lenders, and data from the pilot phases of the National Mortgage Database. Each of these data sources was not necessarily relevant to each of the rulemakings. The Bureau used the additional data from NMLS and NMLS Mortgage Call Report data to better corroborate its estimate of the contours of the non-depository segment of the mortgage market. The Bureau has received loan file extracts from three lenders, but at this point, the data from one lender is not usable and the data from the other two is not sufficiently standardized nor representative to inform consideration of the final rules. Additionally, the Bureau has thus far not yet received data from the National Mortgage Database pilot phases. The Bureau also requested that commenters submit relevant data. All probative data submitted by commenters are discussed in this document.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In light of these data limitations, the analysis below generally provides a qualitative discussion of the benefits, costs, and impacts of the final rule. General economic principles, together with the limited data that are available, provide insight into these benefits, costs, and impacts. Where possible, the Bureau has made quantitative estimates based on these principles and the data that are available. For the reasons stated in this preamble, the Bureau considers that the rule as adopted faithfully implements the purposes and objectives of Congress in the statute. Based on each and all of these considerations, the Bureau has concluded that the rule is appropriate as an implementation of the Act.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Baseline for Analysis</HD>
          <P>The amendments to TILA in sections 1403 and 1414(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act would have taken effect automatically on January 21, 2013, in the absence of these final rules implementing those requirements.<SU>161</SU>
            <FTREF/>Specifically, new TILA section 129B(c)(2), which was added by section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act and restricts the ability of a creditor, the mortgage originator, or any affiliate of either to collect from the consumer upfront discount points, origination points, or origination fees in a transaction in which the mortgage originator receives from a person other than the consumer an origination fee or charge, would have taken effect automatically unless the Bureau exercised its authority to waive or create exemptions from this prohibition. New TILA section 129B(b)(1) requires each mortgage originator to be qualified and include unique identification numbers on loan documents. TILA section 129B(c)(1) prohibits mortgage originators in residential mortgage loans from receiving compensation that varies based on loan terms. TILA section 129C(d) creates prohibitions on single-premium credit insurance, and TILA section 129C(e) provides restrictions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims. These statutory amendments to TILA also would have taken effect automatically in the absence of the Bureau's instant regulation.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>161</SU>Sections 129B(b)(2) and 129B(c)(3) of TILA, as added by sections 1402 and 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act, however, do not impose requirements on mortgage originators until Bureau implementing regulations take effect.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>In some instances, this final rule provides exemptions to certain statutory provisions. These exemptions are made to enhance the benefits received by consumers relative to allowing the TILA amendments to take effect automatically. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits consumer payment of upfront discount points, origination points, and origination fees in all residential mortgage transactions where someone other than the consumer pays a loan originator compensation tied to the transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission). Pursuant to its authority under section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act to create exemptions from this prohibition when doing so would be in the interest of consumers and in the public interest, and other authority, the Bureau's final rule does not prohibit the use of upfront points and fees. In exercising its exemption authority, the Bureau maintains the current degree of choice available to consumers and the current<PRTPAGE P="11393"/>methods by which creditors can hedge prepayment risk inherent in mortgage loans.</P>
          <P>Thus, many costs and benefits of the provisions of the final rule arise largely or entirely from the statute, and not from the final rule. The final rule would provide substantial benefits compared to allowing these provisions to take effect by clarifying parts of the statute that are ambiguous. Greater clarity on these issues should reduce the compliance burdens on covered persons by reducing costs for attorneys and compliance officers as well as potential costs of over-compliance and unnecessary litigation. In addition, the final rule would provide substantial benefits by granting the exemptions to the statute described above that will benefit consumers and avoid disruption to the mortgage industry. Section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act permits the Bureau to consider the benefits and costs of the rule solely compared to the state of the world in which the statute takes effect without an implementing regulation. To provide the public better information about the benefits and costs of the statute, however, the Bureau has nonetheless chosen to evaluate the benefits, costs, and impacts of the major provisions of the final rule against a pre-statutory baseline. That is, the Bureau's analysis below considers the benefits, costs, and impacts of the relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act combined with the final rule implementing those provisions relative to the regulatory regime that pre-dates the Act and remains in effect until the final rule takes effect. The one exception is the analysis of the Bureau's adoption in the final rule of a complete exemption to the statutory ban on upfront points and fees. Evaluating this provision relative to a pre-statutory baseline would be an empty exercise, as the exemption preserves the pre-statute status-quo.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Coverage of the Final Rule</HD>
          <P>The final rule applies to loan originators, as that term is defined in &#xA7; 1036.36(a)(1)(i). The new qualification and document identification requirements also apply to creditors that finance transactions from their own resources and meet the definition of a loan originator. The required compliance procedures only apply to depository institutions. Like existing &#xA7; 1026.36(d) and (e), the new qualification, document identification, and compliance procedure requirements apply to closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling (as opposed to the consumer's principal dwelling). The new arbitration, waiver, and single-premium credit insurance provisions apply to both closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling and HELOCs subject to &#xA7; 1026.40 and secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Potential Benefits and Costs of the Final Rule to Consumers and Covered Persons</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Full Exemption of Discount Points and Origination Points or Fees</HD>

          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits consumer payment of upfront points and fees in all residential mortgage loan transactions, except those where a loan originator does not receive compensation that is tied to the specific transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission) from someone other than a consumer.</P>
          <P>Pursuant to its authority under section 1403 of the Dodd-Frank Act to create exemptions from this prohibition when doing so would be in the interest of consumers and in the public interest, the Bureau earlier proposed to provide that a creditor or loan originator organization may charge a consumer discount points or fees when someone other than the consumer pays a loan originator transaction-specific compensation, but only if the creditor also makes available to the consumer a comparable, alternative loan that excludes discount points, origination points, or origination fees. The proposal to require the creditor to satisfy this prerequisite was termed the &#x201C;zero-zero alternative.&#x201D;</P>
          <P>The Bureau chooses, at this time, to adopt a complete exemption to the statutory ban on upfront points and fees in the final rule, rather than the proposed zero-zero alternative. The Bureau believes that providing a complete exemption at this time, while preserving its ability to revisit the scope of the exemption in the future, will benefit consumers and the public interest by maintaining access to credit and the range of alternative mortgage products available to consumers at this time, and by avoiding any unanticipated effects on the nascent recovery of domestic mortgage and housing markets.</P>
          <P>The Bureau strongly believes, however, that while an exemption from the statutory restrictions on points and fees is, at this time and under the current state of knowledge of the mortgage market, in the consumer and the public interests, future research could indicate that amending the existing regulations regarding points and fees would benefit consumers and the public. The Bureau intends to conduct research into this issue over the next five years. This five-year timeframe corresponds to the Bureau's responsibility to conduct a five-year review of the rule as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Based on its research findings, the Bureau would, as part of this review, assess consumer and public welfare under a complete exemption of the statutory prohibition on points and fees. This five-year review period will allow the Bureau, as part of its research on points and fees, to assess effects on the mortgage market arising from the new disclosures to be issued by the Bureau when the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal is finalized, the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, and other relevant Title XIV rulemakings. The Bureau notes that these Title XIV rulemakings are likely to have a significant impact on how points and fees are structured in the mortgage market. If the Bureau determines over this period that additional requirements are needed, the Bureau would issue a new proposal for public notice and comment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Consumers</HD>
          <P>In any mortgage transaction, the consumer has the option to prepay the loan and exit the existing contract. This option to repay has some inherent value to the consumer and imposes a cost on the creditor.<SU>162</SU>
            <FTREF/>In particular, consumers usually pay for part of this option through one of three alternative means: (1) &#x201C;Discount points,&#x201D; which are the current payment of the value of future interest; (2) a &#x201C;prepayment penalty,&#x201D; which is a payment of the same market value deferred until the time at which the loan balance is actually repaid; or (3) a higher coupon rate on the loan.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>162</SU>Consumers who expect to pay the balance of their loan prior to maturity can purchase from creditors the sole right to choose the date of this payoff. This right is valuable and its price is the market value such a sale creates for creditors in regard to the date of this potential payoff. Creditors exchange rights with consumers but in the opposite direction with &#x201C;callable&#x201D; bonds. This type of bond exhibits an exactly opposite trade, in which the borrower cedes to the creditor the choice of time at which the creditor can require, if it chooses, the borrower to remit the remaining value of the bond.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>In many instances, creditors or loan originators will charge consumers an origination point or fee. When many loan originator organizations serve a mortgage market, competition between them drives these upfront payments to a level just sufficient to cover the cover the labor and material costs the organization incurs from processing the loan and these payments do not represent a source of economic profit for that loan originator organization. Here too, the loan originator could offer the<PRTPAGE P="11394"/>consumer a loan with a higher interest rate in order to recover the creditor's costs. In this sense, discount points and origination points or fees are similar; from the consumer's perspective, they are various upfront charges the consumer may pay where the possibility may exist to trade some or all of this payment in exchange for a higher interest rate.</P>
          <P>By permitting discount points under certain circumstances, the Bureau's final rule offers consumers greater choice over the terms of the coupon payments on their loans and a choice between paying discount points or a higher rate for the purchase of the prepayment option embedded in their loans.<SU>163</SU>
            <FTREF/>In theory consumers make this choice, at least in part, based on how long they will stay in the particular loan. This, in turn, will depend primarily on how long they expect to stay in the property and their beliefs about future conditions in the mortgage market. At the time of origination, however, consumers necessarily have some uncertainty about future events; the actual outcome of such events could induce these consumers to pay off their loan after a shorter period than planned. Consequently, the benefits the consumer actually obtains at the termination of the loan may be less than those the consumer expected at the time of origination and could even result in the consumer suffering a realized loss.<SU>164</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>163</SU>The two options are not mutually exclusive. In some transactions, consumers may pay for the embedded option through more than one of the methods outlined.<E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>Donald Keenan &amp; James J Kau,<E T="03">An Overview of the Option-Theoretic Pricing of Mortgages,</E>6 Journal of Housing Research 217 (1995) (providing an overview of options embedded in residential mortgages); James J Kau, Donald Keenan, Walter Muller &amp; James Epperson,<E T="03">A Generalized Valuation Model for Fixed-Rate Mortgages with Default and Prepayment,</E>11 Journal of Real Estate Finance &amp; Economics 5 (1995) (providing a traditional method to value these options numerically); Robert R.

          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>164</SU>Similarly, consumers who expect to pay their loans over a period sufficiently short as to make the purchase of discount loans unattractive may find it better at the end of this expected period to continue to pay their mortgage and, consequently, suffer an unanticipated loss from refraining from the purchase of points.<E T="03">See</E>Yan Chang &amp; Abdullah Yavas,<E T="03">Do Borrowers Make Rational Choices on Points and Refinancing?,</E>37 Real Estate Economics 635 (2009) (offering empirical evidence that consumers in their sample data remain in their current fixed-rate mortgages for too short a time to recover their initial investment in discount points). Other empirical evidence, however, conflicts with these results in regard to both the frequency and magnitude of losses. Simple numerical calculations that take into account taxes, local volatility in property values, and returns on alternative assets highlight the difficulty in drawing conclusions from much of the empirical data.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Greater choice over the terms of transactions and greater choice over how to pay for the prepayment option should, under all but rare circumstances, increase the ex ante welfare of consumers.<SU>165</SU>
            <FTREF/>The degree to which individual consumers ultimately benefit after origination will depend on their individual circumstances and their relative degree of financial acuity.<SU>166</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>165</SU>Such a circumstance includes, for example, the case in which the need to understand and decide among loans with different points and fees combinations imposes a burden on some consumers. The existence of increased choice made available by this provision would, in this case, be itself a cost to the consumer. Based on standard economic reasoning, the Bureau believes, however, that the circumstances in which the exercise of its exemption authority has the potential to reduce consumer welfare, relative to the statutory prohibition, are, for the most part, quite rare.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>166</SU>The choice over the means by which consumers compensate creditors for the prepayment option is of particular potential benefit to consumers who currently enjoy high liquidity but who either face prospects of diminished liquidity in the future or are more sensitive to the risk posed by a high variance in their future income or wealth. Examples of such consumers include retiring or older individuals wishing to secure their future housing, individuals who are otherwise predisposed to use their wealth for a one-time payment, consumers with relocation funds available, and consumers offered certain rebates by developers or other sellers. In situations where consumers are unaware of their own circumstance or their own relative financial acuity, some creditors may be able to benefit. For example, an unethical creditor may persuade those consumers unaware of their lower relative financial ability to make incorrect decisions regarding purchasing points. The outcome of this type of adverse selection will be reversed when consumers have a more accurate knowledge of their financial abilities than does the creditor.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Relative to permitting the statutory provision to go into effect unaltered, the Bureau's exemption also provides the potential for an additional benefit to consumers when adverse selection in the mortgage market compounds the costs of uncertainty over early repayment. Consumers' purchase of discount points signals to creditors that the expected maturity of their loans is longer than those loans taken out by consumers who do not purchase discount points. This results in the consumer being offered a rate below the rate that would be offered if the rate-point trade-off did not incorporate the signal about the likely length of time that consumers paying points will hold the loan. Creditors respond by offering a lower average rate on each class of mortgages over which creditors have discretion in pricing.<SU>167</SU>
            <FTREF/>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>167</SU>Conversely, the elimination of the option to pay upfront points and fees could, depending on the extant risk in creditors' portfolios and their perceptions of differential risk between neighborhoods, seriously reduce the access to mortgage credit for some consumers.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Covered Persons</HD>
          <P>Relative to implementation of the general statutory prohibition on points and fees without exercise of Bureau's exception authority, the ability to trade a lower loan rate to consumers in exchange for the upfront payment of discount points and origination points or fees is of significant benefit to all creditors participating in loan origination. When purchasing a mortgage, consumers also receive an option to prepay their mortgage balance at a time only they choose. While this &#x201C;prepayment&#x201D; option is valuable to consumers, it is also a source of risk to creditors, which lose future interest rate payments should the consumer prepay the consumer's loan prior to the loan's maturity. The potential for a mutually beneficial exchange of lower rates for current payment of points and fees allows a creditor to recoup a portion of the (market) value of this option, which is equivalent to the creditor's cost of bearing prepayment risk. This is a primary means by which a creditor can hedge the risk posed by fixed-rate mortgages, whether held or sold, to its portfolio and the value of its business.<SU>168</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>168</SU>In contrast, the prohibition on payment of upfront points and fees in the Dodd-Frank Act under most circumstances would ensure that the value of the option to share risk through discount points is lost to both the creditor and the consumer in those circumstances. Absent other means of hedging prepayment risk, creditors would either need to reduce the volume of loans they originate or incur greater costs of raising capital to fund such loans, owing to the increased risk to their business and, consequently, to their solvency.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>A related benefit for creditors arises from the presence of adverse selection among consumers in the mortgage market, which compounds the risks borne from early repayment. Allowing consumers to purchase discount points allows them to signal to creditors that they expect to make payments on their loans for a longer period than other consumers who choose not to purchase such points. Creditors gain from that information and will respond to such differences in behavior.<SU>169</SU>

            <FTREF/>Increasing a creditor's ability to measure more precisely the prepayment risk and credit risk posed by an individual consumer allows it to more precisely adjust the prices or loans to correspond to the particular risk presented by each<PRTPAGE P="11395"/>individual consumer. By charging different loan rates to consumers who pose different degrees of risk, creditors will earn a greater overall return from funding mortgage loans.<SU>170</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>169</SU>Credible signaling in such a situation, from the creditor's perspective, distinguishes two groups of consumers&#x2014;one with low prepayment risk who purchase discount points, and the second a group not purchasing discount points and, consequently, expect to prepay their loan more rapidly than average&#x2014;in what would otherwise be a pool of consumers who are perceived by the creditor to exhibit an equivalent measure of prepayment risk.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>170</SU>In this situation where the efficiency of the market is only impaired by adverse selection, this increase in creditor returns is independent of whether the creditor sells loans in the secondary market or chooses to engage in hedging to hold these mortgages in portfolio.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Both creditors and consumers, consequently, benefit from the role of discount points as a credible signal. This enhances the economic efficiency of the mortgage markets. The Bureau believes that this private means for reducing the risk that the mortgage loan (a liability for the consumer) can pose to the assets of the creditor is a significant source of efficiency in the mortgage market.</P>
          <P>In addition, the final rule benefits covered persons by avoiding the imposition of transition costs, including such things as internal accounting procedures and origination software systems, which would have been imposed had the full statutory prohibition taken effect.</P>
          <P>Finally, mindful of the state of the United States housing and mortgage markets, the final rule also reduces the chance that potential disruptions to the mortgage market might arise from the significant changes to the regulations under which loan originators, creditors, and consumers operate. This final rule should help promote the recovery and stability of those markets.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Compensation Based on Transaction Terms</HD>
          <P>Restricting the means by which a loan originator receives compensation is a way to mitigate potential harm to consumers arising from moral hazard on the part of loan originators.<SU>171</SU>
            <FTREF/>Similar to the existing rule, the Dodd-Frank Act includes such restrictions to mitigate the potential harm to consumers arising from such moral hazard.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>171</SU>Moral hazard, in the current context of mortgage origination, depends fundamentally on the advantage the loan originator has in knowing the least expensive transaction terms acceptable to creditors and greater overall knowledge of the functioning of mortgage markets.<E T="03">See</E>Holden Lewis,<E T="03">&#x201C;Moral Hazard&#x201D; Helps Shape Mortgage Mess,</E>Bankrate (Apr. 18, 2007),<E T="03">available at</E>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act generally follows the existing rule's prohibition on compensating an individual loan originator based on the terms of a transaction. Although the statute and the existing rule are clear that an individual loan originator cannot be compensated differently based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions, they do not expressly address whether the individual loan originator may be compensated based on the terms of multiple transactions, taken in the aggregate, of multiple individual loan originators employed by the same creditor or loan originator organization.</P>
          <P>The Bureau is aware that loan originator organizations may be unsure of how the restrictions on compensation in the current rule apply to compensation based on the profits of the organization.<SU>172</SU>
            <FTREF/>The final rule and commentary address this uncertainty by clarifying the scope of the compensation restrictions in existing &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(i).<SU>173</SU>

            <FTREF/>The final rule treats different methods of compensation differently based on an analysis of the incentives for originators to engage in moral hazard, as created for originators by each such method. The final rule permits a creditor or loan originator organization to make contributions to designated tax-advantaged plans (which include defined benefit and contribution plans that satisfy the qualification requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) or certain other Internal Revenue Code sections), even if the contributions are made out of mortgage-related business profits. The final rule also permits compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans even if the amounts paid are funded through mortgage-related business profits, if: (1) The percentage of a loan originator's compensation attributable to such compensation is equal to or less than 10 percent of total compensation; or (2) the individual loan originator has been a loan originator for ten or fewer transactions during the preceding 12-month period,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>a de minimis test for individuals who originate a very small number of transactions per year. The final rule, however, generally reaffirms the existing rule insofar as it does not permit, under non-deferred profit-based compensation plans and designated defined contribution plans, that individual loan originators be compensated based on the terms of their individual transactions.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>173</SU>As noted in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau issued CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 in response to the questions it received regarding the applicability of the current regulation to designated plans and non-designated plans, and this regulation is intended in part to provide further clarity on such issues. Until the final rule goes into effect, the clarifications in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 will remain in effect.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Consumers</HD>
          <P>The final rule benefits consumers by clarifying the existing rule to address and mitigate the moral hazard inherent in the nature of profits-based compensation and other types of compensation that are directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple transactions of an individual loan originator (these are referred to in this section and the next section as &#x201C;profits-based compensation&#x201D;). Limiting such profits-based compensation for many firms limits the incentives to steer consumers into more expensive loans. To the extent that the existing rule already prohibits a type of compensation plan for loan originators, the final rule's prohibition of such a plan will not result in any new benefits to consumers. The Bureau's approach permits compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans and compensation through designated tax-advantaged plans<SU>174</SU>
            <FTREF/>only in cases in which the relationship between transaction terms and such forms of compensation are sufficiently weak to render insignificant any potential for steering incentives.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>These forms of compensation are designed to provide individual loan originators and other individuals working for the creditor or loan originator organization with greater performance incentives and to align their interests with those of the owners of the entity they work for.<SU>175</SU>
            <FTREF/>When moral hazard exists, however, such compensation determined with reference to profits could lead to misaligned incentives on the part of individual loan originators with respect to consumers.

              <SU>176</SU>When multiple originators are working for a given loan originator organization or creditor, the compensation to each individual loan originator will depend upon on the aggregate efforts of all the loan originators working for this entity, rather than directly on the individual loan originator's own performance. Consequently, if we compare the efforts of an individual loan originator working for a smaller entity with those of another individual at<PRTPAGE/>a larger entity, the effort by the individual at the larger entity will be less than the effort of the individual at the smaller entity, owing to the smaller influence any individual at the larger entity has on the amount of compensation awarded to the individual. This relationship between individual effort and the total number of peers in a given entity is termed &#x201C;free-riding.&#x201D; Free riding behavior has been extensively analyzed: Surveys of these analyses appear in Martin L. Weitzman,<E T="03">Incentive Effects of Profit Sharing, in Trends in Business Organization: Do Participation and Cooperation Increase Competitiveness?</E>(Kiel Inst. of World Econs.1995),<E T="03">available at</E>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The Bureau received a number of comments from industry disagreeing with the premise that profits-based compensation could create incentives for individual loan originators to persuade consumers to accept transactions terms that are costly for the consumer but more profitable for the loan originator. Some industry commenters admitted that such incentives existed but believed that, with regard to profits-based compensation, the incentives were insignificant. Commenters from consumer groups generally asserted that profits-based compensation creates incentives for individual loan originators to steer consumers into loans that are more costly to the consumer.</P>
          <P>The Bureau recognizes that the potential that profits-based compensation has to create adverse incentives for individual loan originators depends, in general, on both how the efforts of individual loan originators affect profits and how those profits affect the compensation distributed to individual loan originators. The Bureau also recognizes that, depending on the particular environment in which a particular individual loan originator conducts business, these adverse incentives could decline as the number of individual loan originators involved in the specified profit-sharing plan increases.</P>
          <P>The Bureau, however, notes that the current state of academic research has not provided an unequivocal answer to the question of whether any given profit-based compensation arrangement will produce incentives sufficiently strong for individual loan originators to engage in consumer steering. The Bureau also notes that this research, whether based on theoretical or empirical methods, shows that the potential for any profit-sharing plan to create adverse incentives are acutely sensitive to the specific features of the working environment and the means by which such profits are distributed to the relevant individual loan originators.<SU>177</SU>
            <FTREF/>Finally, the Bureau notes that any potential reduction in the strength of these incentives is almost surely insufficient, under all realistic circumstances, to eliminate them entirely.<SU>178</SU>

              <SU>177</SU>Economic research has established the general principle that the amount of work individuals put into a given task, in response to remuneration based on the sharing of profits, declines as the number of their peers increases (&#x201C;free-riding.&#x201D;). No principle with such generality has been shown, however, in regard to the rate of this decline and the amount of individual work effort for any particular group of employees. Features of the means by which profits are distributed to individuals and the individual's environment within a given firm, such as the individual's ability to observe the performance of his peers and the frequency of managerial monitoring of individual performance, strongly affect these variables, as shown in a number of recent studies, including empirical and experimental research papers: Susan Helper, et al.,<E T="03">Analyzing Compensation Methods in Manufacturing: Piece Rates, Time Rates, or Gain-Sharing?,</E>(NBER Working Paper No. 16540, 2010); R.

          </FTNT>
          <P>Despite the uncertainties the remain in the economic literature, the Bureau believes that the approach taken in the final rule will benefit consumers by mitigating the moral hazard inherent in compensation systems that are based, directly or indirectly, on the terms of mortgage loan transactions, including those based on multiple transactions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Covered Persons</HD>
          <P>As described above, considering the benefits, costs, and impacts of this provision requires the understanding of current industry practice against which to measure any changes. As discussed, the Bureau is aware, based in part on outreach to and inquiries received from industry, that originator organizations may be unclear about the application of the existing rule to profits-based compensation plans, including non-deferred profits-based compensation and employer compensation through designated plans. In light of this lack of clarity, the Bureau believes that industry practice likely varies and therefore any determination of the costs and benefit of the final rule depend critically on assumptions about current firm practices.</P>
          <P>Firms that currently offer profits-based compensation for individual loan originators that would continue to be allowed under the final rule should incur no costs from the final rule. They could, however, benefit from the presence of a regulation and accompanying official commentary that clarifies which methods of loan originator compensation are permissible. Notably, the final rule explicitly states that employer contributions to designated defined contribution plans in which individual loan originators participate are permitted, provided that the contributions are not based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions. Such firms can continue to benefit from these arrangements, which have the potential to motivate individual productivity, to reduce potential intra-firm moral hazard by aligning the interests of individual originators with those of creditor or loan originator organization for whom they work and to reduce the potential for increased costs arising from adverse selection in the retention of more productive individual loan originators. Firms that do not offer such plans would benefit, with the increased clarity of the final rule, from the opportunity to do so should they so choose.<SU>179</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>179</SU>Some firms may choose not to offer such compensation. In certain circumstances, an originating institution (perhaps unable to invest in sufficient management expertise) will see reduced profitability from adopting profits-based compensation plans.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Similarly, some firms may currently compensate their individual loan originators through methods, such as designated defined benefit plans, the legality of which may have been unclear, with different originator organizations interpreting the existing rule differently. The final rule benefits these firms by clarifying the legality of various compensation practices.<PRTPAGE P="11397"/>
          </P>
          <P>As discussed above, the final rule permits compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans, including bonuses, to be paid from mortgage-related profits if such compensation for an individual loan originator does not, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation. This will benefit firms that would prefer to pay these types of bonuses or make these types of contributions out of mortgage-related profits, but do not because of uncertainty about the application of the existing rule. Firms that currently compensate individual loan originators through non-deferred profits-based compensation plans in excess of 10 percent of individual loan originators' total compensation might have to adjust their non-deferred profits-based compensation to comply with the 10-percent total compensation test under the final rule. This may impose some adjustment costs or may make it more costly to attract or retain qualified loan originators.</P>

          <P>The final rule also contains a de minimis provision exempting individuals who originate ten or fewer loans per year from limitations on non-deferred profits-based compensation. This provision is intended to avoid penalizing those individuals whose compensation from the origination of a small number of loans is insufficient to give them incentives inimical to the welfare of consumers. Industry commenters generally favored the de minimis exception, although a few commenters preferred a higher value for the de minimis threshold (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>one trade association representing banks requested a threshold of 15). The Bureau's survey of recent research into the relation of the total number of employees in a given firm, the value of total compensation to any individual employee, and the effects on the behavior of individual employees of compensation that is based on the profits arising from the collective effort of all employees of that firm corroborates the judgment that any adverse incentives from profits-based compensation to an individual under the final rule's de minimis threshold are insignificant and do not affect the welfare of consumers.<SU>180</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Qualification Requirements for Loan Originators</HD>
          <P>Section 1402 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends TILA to impose a duty on loan originators to be &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; and, where applicable, registered or licensed as a loan originator under State law and the Federal SAFE Act. Employees of depositories, certain of their subsidiaries, and bona fide nonprofit organizations currently do not have to meet the SAFE Act standards that apply to licensing, such as taking pre-licensure classes, passing a test, meeting character and fitness standards, having no felony convictions within the previous seven years, or taking annual continuing education classes. To implement the Dodd-Frank-Act's requirement that entities employing or retaining the services of individual loan originators be &#x201C;qualified,&#x201D; the final rule requires entities whose individual loan originators are not subject to SAFE Act licensing, including depositories and bona fide nonprofit loan originator entities, to: (1) Ensure that their individual loan originators meet character and fitness and criminal background standards similar to the licensing standards that the SAFE Act applies to employees of non-bank loan originators; and (2) provide appropriate training to their individual loan originators commensurate with the mortgage origination activities of the individual. The final rule mandates training appropriate for the actual lending activities of the individual loan originator and does not impose a minimum number of training hours.</P>
          <P>Industry commenters to the proposal disagreed that there is a need for individual loan officers to meet qualification standards because loan originators already must comply with the requirements of prudential regulations. The Bureau also received a number of requests from industry representatives to refrain from adopting mandatory testing and education requirements in favor of instead requiring taking courses and passing examinations approved by the NMLSR. Finally, an association of mortgage bankers requested that the Bureau explore imposing a national test for all bank employees or employees of creditors that offer loans.</P>
          <P>The Bureau notes that it is not opposed to the idea of future testing for all bank employees or employees of creditors who offer loans. Conditional on the current state of the mortgage market, however, the Bureau believes that the burden imposed by comprehensive testing might, at this time, be sufficiently burdensome to further decrease benefits to consumers, and covered persons as a whole.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Consumers</HD>
          <P>The primary benefit to consumers of the qualification provisions of the final rule are that tighter qualifications will screen out, on an ongoing basis after implementation of the final rule and with regard to some loan officers currently employed who have not previously been screened, those individual originators with backgrounds suggesting they could pose risks to consumers and will raise the level of loan originator expertise regarding the origination process. Both of these effects will likely decrease the harm that could be borne, unknowingly at the time of origination, by any individual consumer.</P>
          <P>Several industry representatives, including national and State industry trade associations and large depository institutions, expressed doubt about whether consumers would receive significant benefits from the change in qualification requirements.</P>
          <P>The Bureau believes that its qualification requirement will improve consumer welfare because it will help ensure that any individual loan originator with whom a consumer negotiates a loan will possess levels of expertise and integrity no less than those required in the final rule and assures consumer that they bear relatively little risk of encountering a loan originator who lacks these qualifications. While measuring the magnitude of this benefit is impossible with currently available public data, the Bureau notes that the its qualification requirement will not only convey a direct benefit to consumers, it will, in addition, benefit both consumers and covered persons through the reduction of this source of adverse selection among new originators. This reduction will increase economic efficiency in the market and allow more mutually beneficial loan transactions to occur.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Potential Benefits and Costs to Covered Persons</HD>
          <P>The increased requirements for institutions that employ individuals not licensed under the SAFE Act would further assure that the individual loan originators in their employ satisfy those levels of expertise and standards of probity as specified in the final rule.<SU>181</SU>

            <FTREF/>This would have a positive effect by tending to reduce any potential liability they incur in future mortgage transactions and to enhance their reputation among consumers. If the requirements, as expected, reduce the likelihood that consumers will encounter loan originators with<PRTPAGE P="11398"/>inadequate expertise or integrity, this may lead to an increase in consumer confidence and may possibly increase the number of consumers willing to engage in these transactions. Some entities could, however, face increased recruitment, training, and related costs in complying with these new requirements.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>181</SU>Under Regulation G, depository institutions must already obtain criminal background checks for their individual loan originator employees and review them for compliance under Section 19 of the FDIA.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>In addition, relative to current market conditions, the final rule would create a more level &#x201C;playing field&#x201D; between non-depository institutions and depository and nonprofit institutions with regard to the enhanced training requirements and background checks that would be required of depository institutions. This may help mitigate possible adverse selection in the market for individual originators, in which individuals who cannot meet the requirements for non-depository institutions might seek employment by depository and nonprofit institutions.</P>
          <P>These requirements may also slightly limit the pool of employees from which to hire, relative to the pool from which they can hire under existing requirements. Similarly, the requirement for credit checks for new hires (and those who were not screened under standards in effect at the time of hire) will result in some minimal increased costs. Bona fide nonprofit institutions not currently subject to the SAFE Act will have to incur the costs of both the criminal background check and the credit check.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Mandatory Arbitration and Waivers of Federal Claims</HD>
          <P>Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 129C(e) to TILA. Section 129C(e)(1) prohibits the inclusion of terms in any contract or agreement for a residential mortgage loan (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) or extension of open-end credit secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for resolving any controversy or settling any claims arising out of the transaction. Section 129C(e)(2) provides that a consumer and creditor may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may bar a consumer's ability to bring a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law. Section 1026.36(h) of the final rule implements and clarifies these statutory provisions.</P>
          <P>The restrictions on mandatory arbitration and waiver of Federal claims are imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is implementing these protections by regulation. The Bureau believes that implementing regulations provide benefits to consumers and covered persons by providing clarity and thereby facilitating compliance with the statutory provisions.</P>
          <P>The Bureau received one comment from an industry association asserting that the prohibition of mandatory arbitration as a means of resolving disputes between consumer and creditor, and instead allowing the consumer to seek resolution through the court system would increase the cost of credit to consumers. One member of industry also speculated that, by allegedly expanding the statutory prohibition of mandatory arbitration to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer, the final rule could impose significant costs on those creditors making open-ended and other forms of credit available to consumers. Several consumer groups expressed concern regarding the timing of the implementation of the provision, asserting that, since the proposal made no substantive changes to the statutory provision, the effective date of implementation provided by the statute should also be maintained.</P>

          <P>To the extent that contractual terms requiring mandatory arbitration and restricting waiver Federal claims benefit covered persons by reducing litigation and other expenses, the statute and implementing regulation will create costs for covered persons. The Bureau notes, however, that covered persons and consumers will still be permitted to agree, after a dispute has arisen, to submit<E T="03">that</E>dispute to arbitration. The Bureau also notes that, to its knowledge, no compelling empirical evidence supports the comments that consumer access to the court system for the resolution of disputes would increase the cost of such mortgages to consumers. In addition, no evidence supporting this prediction was presented by the industry association making this assertion or by any other industry or consumer representative.</P>
          <P>The Bureau disagrees with the assertion that the final rule would impose costs on those creditors marketing open-ended loans and other forms of credit not secured by principal dwelling of the consumer. Since proposed &#xA7; 1026.36(j), implemented in the final rule as &#xA7; 1026.36(b), clarifies that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which &#xA7; 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer, no additional litigation cost is imposed on these creditors from this source.<SU>182</SU>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Creditor Financing of &#x201C;Single Premium&#x201D; Credit Insurance</HD>
          <P>Dodd-Frank Act section 1414 added section 129C(d) to TILA. Section 129C(d) pertains to a creditor financing credit insurance fees for the consumer. Although the provision permits insurance premiums to be calculated and paid in full per month, this provision prohibits a creditor from financing any fees, including premiums, for credit insurance in closed- and certain open-end loan transactions secured by a dwelling. The final rule implements the relevant statutory provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. Owing to the lack of transparency consumers may experience in negotiating a mortgage loan with a creditor while simultaneously needing to decide to finance their insurance, such as through an increase in their mortgage payments, with this same creditor, the Bureau believes there is significant potential for such a combined transaction to harm the consumer. The final rule should, on this basis, benefit consumers.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Additional Potential Benefits and Costs</HD>
          <P>Covered persons will have to incur some costs in reviewing the final rule and adapting their business practices to any new requirements. The Bureau notes that many of the provisions of the final rule do not require significant changes to current practice, since many of the provisions in this final rule are also in the existing rule, and therefore these costs should be minimal for most covered persons.</P>

          <P>The Bureau has considered whether the final rule would lead to a potential reduction in access to consumer financial products and services. Firms will not have to incur substantial operational costs nor any potential loss owing to adverse selection among loan originators. As a result, the Bureau does not anticipate any material impact on existing consumer access to mortgage credit. The Bureau, however, does note that its final rule precludes any reduction in credit access that could otherwise occur without its exemption from the statutory prohibition on points and fees.<PRTPAGE P="11399"/>

          </FTNT>
          <P>The Bureau believes that its final rule will provide significant benefits to smaller creditors. Although some creditors could incur potential costs associated with stricter qualification standards for newly hired loan officers, because of the Bureau's use of its exemption authority, smaller creditors will receive a significant benefit from their ability to continue to hedge the prepayment risk inherent in fixed-rate mortgages through the sale of discount points to their consumers. Smaller creditors normally use this method to hedge such risk because the relatively small volume of loans they finance make prohibitive the costs they incur in using other means of hedging, such as the sale of their loans in the secondary market or through transactions in swap and other derivatives markets. Absent the Bureau's use of its exemption authority, the statue's prohibition on the sale of discount points combined with extensive restrictions on prepayment penalties would have resulted in virtually all smaller creditors choosing to either originate a smaller volume of mortgage loans or bearing a higher degree of portfolio risk. This would result in the average smaller creditor being far less competitive with their larger rivals, losing market share, paying higher costs of funds, and bearing a greater risk of insolvency. The consequence of these disadvantages would inevitably be higher frequencies among small creditors of both bankruptcy and absorption by large financial holding companies. This would result in higher interest rates and reduced access to credit to consumers. The final rule saves smaller creditors from these potential costs by exempting them from the ban on points and fees.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Impact on Consumers in Rural Areas</HD>
          <P>Consumers in rural areas are unlikely to experience benefits or costs from the final rule that significantly differ from those experienced by consumers in general. To the extent that consumers in rural areas may depend more heavily on small creditors, however, they may be more affected by the effects of the rule on small creditors, as described above.</P>

          <P>Based on the comments received, and for the reasons stated below, the Bureau is not certifying that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the Bureau has prepared the following final regulatory flexibility analysis pursuant to section 604 of the RFA.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. A Statement of the Need for, and Objectives of, the Rule</HD>
          <P>During the aftermath of the recent crisis in financial markets, in 2010 the Board issued the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule. Authority for that rule now resides with the Bureau.<SU>189</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>189</SU>A prior description of the details of the origin and nature of the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule may be found in Background, Part II, appearing above.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule addressed many concerns regarding the lack of transparency, consumer confusion, and steering incentives created by certain residential loan originator compensation structures. The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions that substantially resembled<PRTPAGE P="11400"/>those in the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule, but also added further provisions.</P>
          <P>The Board noted, in adopting the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule, that the Dodd-Frank Act would necessitate further rulemaking to implement the additional provisions of the legislation not reflected by the regulation. These provisions are new TILA sections 129B(b)(1) (requiring each mortgage originator to be qualified and include unique identification numbers on loan documents), (b)(2) (requiring depository institution compliance procedures), (c)(1) and (c)(2) (prohibiting steering incentives including prohibiting mortgage originators from receiving compensation that varies based on loan terms and from receiving origination charges or fees from persons other than the consumer except in certain circumstances), and 129C(d) and (e) (prohibiting financing of single-premium credit insurance and providing restrictions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims), as added by sections 1402, 1403, and 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>
          <P>The Bureau, in undertaking this rulemaking, is also clarifying certain provisions of the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule to provide additional clarity and reduce uncertainty to both consumers and covered persons.</P>
          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act and TILA authorize the Bureau to adopt implementing regulations for the statutory provisions provided by sections 1402, 1403, and 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is using this authority to issue regulations to provide creditors and loan originators with clarity about their obligations under these provisions. The Bureau is also adjusting or providing exemptions to the statutory requirements, including the obligations of small entities, in certain circumstances. The Bureau is taking this action in order to ease burden when doing so would not sacrifice adequate protection of consumers.<SU>190</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>190</SU>The new statutory requirements relating to compensation take effect automatically on January 21, 2013, as written in the statute, unless final rules are issued on or prior to that date that provide for a later effective date.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>The objectives of this rulemaking are: (1) To revise current &#xA7; 1026.36 and commentary to implement substantive requirements in new TILA sections 129B(b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) and 129C(d) and (e), as added by sections 1402, 1403, and 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act; (2) to clarify ambiguities resulting from differences between current &#xA7; 1026.36 and the new TILA amendments; (3) to adjust existing rules governing compensation to individual loan originators to account for Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA; and (4) to provide greater clarity and flexibility on several issues.</P>
          <P>The Bureau adopts, in the final rule, a complete exemption to the Dodd-Frank Act ban on the consumer paying upfront points and fees that would otherwise apply to all covered transactions in which anyone other than the consumer pays compensation to a loan originator. Specifically, the final rule amends &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(2)(ii) to provide that a payment to a loan originator that is otherwise prohibited by section 129B(c)(2)(A) of the Truth in Lending Act is nevertheless permitted pursuant to section 129B(c)(2)(B) of the Act, regardless of whether the consumer makes any upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees, as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, as long as the mortgage originator does not receive any compensation directly from the consumer as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. Accordingly, the Bureau does not adopt the portion of the proposal that would have required creditors or loan originator organizations to generally make available an alternative loan without discount points or origination points or fees where they offer a loan with discount points or origination points or fees. This complete exemption is being implemented by the Bureau under Dodd-Frank Act section 1403 because, as explained in the section-by-section analysis, it is in the interest of consumers and the public interest, as well as under other authority.</P>
          <P>The final rule also implements certain other Dodd-Frank Act requirements applicable to closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling and open-end extensions of consumer credit secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Specifically, the rule codifies TILA section 129C(d), which creates prohibitions on financing of premiums for single-premium credit insurance. The provisions of this rule also implement TILA section 129C(e), which restricts agreements requiring consumers to submit any disputes to arbitration and limits waivers of Federal claims, thereby preserving consumers' ability to seek redress through the court system after a dispute arises. The final rule also implements TILA section 129B(b)(2), which requires the Bureau to prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions to establish and monitor compliance of such depository institutions, the subsidiaries of such institutions, and the employees of both with the requirements of TILA section 129B and the registration procedures established under section 1507 of the SAFE Act.</P>
          <P>In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act extended previous efforts by lawmakers and regulators to strengthen loan originator qualifications and regulate industry compensation practices. New TILA section 129B(b) imposes a duty on loan originators to be &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; and, where applicable, registered or licensed as a loan originator under State law and the Federal SAFE Act and to include unique identification numbers on loan documents. The final rule implements this section and expands consumer protections by requiring entities whose individual loan originators are not subject to SAFE Act licensing requirements, including depositories and bona fide nonprofit loan originator entities, to: (1) Ensure that their individual loan originators, hired on or after the rule's effective date (or otherwise not screened according to procedures in place when they were hired), meet character and fitness and criminal background standards similar to the licensing standards that the SAFE Act applies to employees of non-bank loan originators; and (2) provide appropriate training to their individual loan originators commensurate with the mortgage origination activities of the individual.</P>
          <P>Furthermore, the final rule adjusts existing rules governing compensation to individual loan originators in connection with closed-end mortgage transactions to account for Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA and provide greater clarity and flexibility. Specifically, the final rule preserves, with some refinements, the prohibition on the payment or receipt of commissions or other loan originator compensation based on the terms of the transaction (other than loan amount) and on loan originators being compensated simultaneously by both consumers and other persons in the same transaction. To further reduce potential steering incentives for loan originators created by certain compensation arrangements, the final rule also clarifies and revises restrictions on profits-based compensation for loan originators, depending on the potential for incentives to steer consumers to different transaction terms.</P>

          <P>Finally, the final rule makes two changes to the current record retention provisions of &#xA7; 1026.25 of TILA. The revised provisions: (1) Require a creditor to maintain records of the compensation paid to a loan originator, and the governing compensation<PRTPAGE P="11401"/>agreement, for three years after the date of payment; and (2) require a loan originator organization to maintain records of the compensation it receives from a creditor, a consumer, or another person and that it pays to its individual loan originators, as well as the compensation agreement that governs those receipts or payments, for three years after the date of the receipts or payments. By ensuring that records associated with loan originator compensation are retained for a time period commensurate with the statute of limitations for causes of action under TILA section 130 and are readily available for examination, these modifications to the existing recordkeeping provisions will prevent circumvention or evasion of TILA and facilitate compliance.</P>
          <P>The legal basis for the final rule is discussed in detail in the legal authority analysis in the section-by-section analysis above.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Summary of Issues Raised by Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</HD>
          <P>In accordance with section 3(a) of the RFA, the Bureau prepared an IRFA. In the IFRA, the Bureau estimated the possible compliance costs for small entities from each major component of the rule against a pre-statute baseline. The Bureau requested comments on the IRFA but did not receive any such comments. The Bureau did receive some comments describing in general terms the impact of the proposed rule on small creditors and loan originator organizations and the need for exemptions for small entities from various provisions of the proposed rule. These comments, and the responses, are discussed in the section-by-section analysis.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Response to the Comment From the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy</HD>
          <P>SBA Advocacy provided a formal comment letter to the Bureau in response to the proposal. Among other things, the letter expressed concern about the following issues: Record retention; the prohibition of consumer payment of upfront points and fees; the restrictions on compensation based on transaction terms; and the mandatory arbitration, waiver of Federal claims, and credit insurance provisions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Record Retention</HD>
          <P>SBA Advocacy noted that the Small Entity Representatives had expressed concern that the proposed requirements for a loan originator organization or creditor to retain for three years documents evidencing the amount of compensation paid to a loan originator were unclear and overbroad, especially given the broad definition of &#x201C;compensation&#x201D; in the proposed rule. The Bureau disagrees that the record retention requirements are either unclear or overbroad, and the Bureau provides examples in the commentary to &#xA7; 1026.25(c)(2) of the types of records that could be sufficient to satisfy the record-retention requirements, depending on the type of compensation.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Upfront Points and Fees</HD>
          <P>SBA Advocacy relayed the Small Entity Representatives' strong support of the Bureau's proposed use of its exemption authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to allow consumers to pay upfront discount and origination points and fees. SBA Advocacy noted that the Small Entity Representatives were concerned, however, that the proposal's requirement for creditors or loan originator organizations to offer an alternative loan without discount points or origination points or fees (the &#x201C;zero-zero alternative&#x201D;) would have been unrealistic for small entities. For reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau is not implementing the zero-zero alternative and is instead exercising its authority under the points and fees provision to effect a complete exemption to the prohibition on consumer payment of upfront points and fees.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Compensation Based on Transaction Terms</HD>
          <P>SBA Advocacy expressed concern with the portion of the proposal that would have permitted bonuses and contributions to non-designated plans from mortgage-related profits only if the mortgage-business revenue component of total revenues is below a certain threshold.<SU>191</SU>
            <FTREF/>For reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis, the final rule does not include this provision. Instead, the Bureau is implementing a final rule that permits compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans, in which the compensation is determined with reference to profits from mortgage-related business, provided that the compensation is not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the individual's residential mortgage loan transactions and the compensation is equal to or less than 10 percent of the loan originator's total compensation.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>191</SU>The Bureau previously used the term &#x201C;qualified,&#x201D; not &#x201C;designated.&#x201D;</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>SBA Advocacy also expressed concern that any mistake in compensation structure might result in loans being returned from the secondary market and a massive buyback. To the extent that violations of the rule could lead to this result, it is possible that such an event could occur today because Regulation Z already contains provisions that prohibit the payment of compensation based on transaction terms as well as payment of loan originator compensation by both a consumer and a person other than the consumer on the same transaction. The final rule provides clarifications and grants relief under certain circumstances with respect to these existing restrictions.</P>

          <P>The Bureau believes that the application of the 10-percent total compensation test will be less likely to result in the scenarios described by SBA Advocacy than the proposed revenue test. The Bureau acknowledges that several industry commenters expressed concern about potential TILA liability where an error is made under the revenue test calculation; SBA Advocacy's concern about buyback is related to these concerns. As a threshold matter, creditors and loan originator organizations can choose whether or not to pay this type of compensation, and a payer of compensation has full knowledge and control over the numerical and other information used to determine the compensation. That said, the Bureau is sensitive to SBA Advocacy's concerns but believes they are not warranted to nearly the same degree with the 10-percent total compensation test. Under the revenue test, an error in determining the amount of total revenues or mortgage-related revenues could have potentially impacted all awards of profits-based compensation to individual loan originators for a particular time period. Because the 10-percent total compensation test focuses on compensation at the individual loan originator level, however, the potential liability implications of a calculation error largely would be limited to the effect of that error alone. In other words, in contrast to the revenue test, an error under the 10-percent total compensation test would not likely have downstream liability implications as to other compensation payments across the company or business unit and, therefore, would be extremely unlikely to result in the &#x201C;massive buyback&#x201D; described by SBA Advocacy. The Bureau also believes that creditors and loan originator organizations will develop policies and procedures to minimize the possibility of such errors.<PRTPAGE P="11402"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Mandatory Arbitration, Waivers of Federal Claims, and Credit Insurance</HD>
          <P>SBA Advocacy commented that it was uncertain why the mandatory arbitration and credit insurance provisions were addressed in the loan originator compensation rule. The provisions in the final rule are intended to clarify the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration, waivers of Federal claims, and creditor financing of single premium credit insurance in the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Description and, Where Feasible, Provision of an Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Final Rule Will Apply</HD>
          <P>As discussed in the Small Business Review Panel Report, for purposes of assessing the impacts of the regulations being implemented on small entities, &#x201C;small entities&#x201D; are defined in the RFA to include small businesses, small nonprofit organizations, and small government jurisdictions. 5 U.S.C. 601(6). A &#x201C;small business&#x201D; is determined by application of SBA regulations and reference to the North American Industry Classification System (&#x201C;NAICS&#x201D;) classifications and size standards.<SU>192</SU>
            <FTREF/>5 U.S.C. 601(3). A &#x201C;small organization&#x201D; is any &#x201C;not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.&#x201D; 5 U.S.C. 601(4). A &#x201C;small governmental jurisdiction&#x201D; is the government of a city, county, town, township, village, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000. 5 U.S.C. 601(5).</P>
          <FTNT>

              <SU>192</SU>The current SBA size standards are available on the SBA's Web site at<E T="03">http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards</E>.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>During the Small Business Review Panel process, the Bureau identified six categories of small entities that may be subject to the proposed rule for purposes of the RFA:</P>
          <P>&#x2022; Commercial banks (NAICS 522110);</P>
          <P>&#x2022; savings institutions (NAICS 522120);<SU>193</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>193</SU>Savings institutions include thrifts, savings banks, mutual banks, and similar institutions.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>&#x2022; credit unions (NAICS 522130);</P>
          <P>&#x2022; firms providing real estate credit (NAICS 522292);</P>
          <P>&#x2022; mortgage brokers (NAICS 522310); and</P>
          <P>&#x2022; small nonprofit organizations.</P>
          <P>Commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions are small businesses if they have $175 million or less in assets. Firms providing real estate credit and mortgage brokers are small businesses if their average annual receipts do not exceed $7 million.</P>
          <P>A small nonprofit organization is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field. Small nonprofit organizations engaged in loan origination typically perform a number of activities directed at increasing the supply of affordable housing in their communities. Some small nonprofit organizations originate mortgage loans for low and moderate-income individuals while others purchase loans originated by local community development lenders.</P>
          <P>The Bureau's estimated number of affected and small entities by NAICS Code and engagement in loan origination appears in the table below. The estimates in this analysis are based upon data and statistical analyses performed by the Bureau. To estimate counts and properties of mortgages for entities that do not report under HMDA, the Bureau has matched HMDA data to Call Report data and NMLS and has statistically projected estimated loan counts for those depository institutions that do not report these data either under HMDA or on the NCUA call report. The Bureau has projected originations of higher-priced mortgage loans for depositories that do not report HMDA in a similar fashion. These projections use Poisson regressions that estimate loan volumes as a function of an institution's total assets, employment, mortgage holdings and geographic presence.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Final Rule, Including an Estimate of the Classes of Small Entities Which Will Be Subject to the Requirement and the Type of Professional Skills Necessary for the Preparation of the Report</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Reporting Requirements</HD>
          <P>The final rule does not impose new reporting requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Recordkeeping Requirements</HD>
          <P>Regulation Z currently requires creditors to create and maintain records to demonstrate their compliance with provisions that apply to the compensation paid to or received by a loan originator. As discussed above in part V, the final rule requires creditors to retain these records for a three-year period, rather than for a two-year period as currently required. The rule applies the same requirement to organizations when they act as a loan originator in a transaction, even if they do not act as a creditor in the transaction. The revised recordkeeping requirements, however, do not apply to individual loan originators.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau recognizes that increasing the period a creditor must retain records for specific information related to loan originator compensation from two years, as currently provided in Regulation Z, to three years may impose some marginal increase in the creditor's compliance burden in the form of the incremental cost of storage. The Bureau believes, however, that creditors should be able to use existing recordkeeping systems to maintain the records for an additional year at minimal cost. Similarly, although loan originator organizations may incur some costs to establish and maintain recordkeeping systems, loan originator organizations may be able to use existing recordkeeping systems that they maintain for other purposes at minimal cost. During the Small Business Review Panel process, the Small Entity Representatives were asked about their current record retention practices and the potential impact of the proposed enhanced record retention requirements. Of the few Small Entity Representatives who provided feedback on the issue, one creditor stated that it maintained detailed records of compensation paid to all of its employees and that a regulator already reviews its compensation plans regularly, and another creditor reported that it did not believe the proposed record retention requirement would require it to change its current practices. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe that the record retention requirements will create undue burden for small entity creditors and loan originator organizations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Compliance Requirements</HD>
          <P>As discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis, the final rule imposes new compliance requirements on creditors and loan originator organizations. The possible compliance costs for small entities from each major component of the final rule are presented below. In most cases, the Bureau presents these costs against a pre-statute baseline. As noted above in the section 1022(b)(2) analysis in part VII above, provisions where the Bureau has used its exemption authority are discussed relative to the statutory provisions. The analysis below considers the benefits, costs, and impacts of the following major provisions on small entities: (1) Upfront points and fees; (2) compensation based on a term of a transaction; and (3) qualification requirements for loan originations. It also discusses other provisions in less detail.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Upfront Points and Fees</HD>

          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits consumer payment of upfront points and fees in all residential mortgage loan transactions except those where no one other than the consumer pays a loan originator compensation tied to the transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission) and provides the Bureau authority to waive or create exemptions from this prohibition if doing so is in the interest of consumer and in the public interest. As discussed in the Background and section-by-section analysis, the Bureau adopts in the final rule a complete exemption to the statutory ban on upfront points and fees. Specifically, the final rule amends &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(2) to provide that a payment to a loan originator that is otherwise prohibited by section 129B(c)(2)(A) of TILA is nevertheless permitted pursuant to section 129B(c)(2)(B) of TILA, regardless of whether the consumer makes any upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees, as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(ii) of TILA, as long as the mortgage originator does not receive any compensation directly from the consumer as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(i) of TILA.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Benefits to Small Entities</HD>
          <P>The final rule's treatment of the payment of upfront points and fees has a number of potential benefits for small entities. First, relative to the complete prohibition on the payment of points and fees that the Dodd-Frank Act would have applied absent the exercise of the Bureau's exemption authority, the final rule maintains the opportunity during origination for the current wide choice consumers have in selecting a specific mortgage product from the current variety of mortgage products available to them. The ability of creditors and loan originator organizations, particularly small ones, to offer consumers this wide variety of choices, relative to that available under the baseline, occurs primarily because under the final rule consumers and particularly small creditors and loan originator organizations retain the opportunity to exchange, at the time of origination, a mutually agreeable share of the financial risk inherent in the future payments required by any given mortgage loan. Consumers, in this exchange, may decide to purchase discount points from the loan originator and in return receive a reduced loan rate which is commensurate with the lower degree of credit and prepayment risk now borne by the creditor holding the loan.</P>
          <P>Moreover, the ability of small creditors to charge discount points in exchange for lower interest rates would accommodate those consumers who prefer to pay more at settlement in exchange for lower monthly interest charges and could produce a greater volume of available credit in residential mortgage markets. Preserving this ability would potentially allow a wider access to homeownership, which would benefit consumers, creditors, loan originator organizations, and individual loan originators. The ability to charge origination fees upfront also would allow small creditors to recover fixed costs at the time they are incurred rather than over time through increased interest payments or through the secondary market prices. And similarly, preserving the flexibility for affiliates of creditors and loan originator organizations to charge fees upfront should allow for these firms to charge directly for their services. This means that creditors and loan originator organizations may be less likely to divest such entities than if the Dodd-Frank Act mandate takes effect as written.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Costs to Small Entities</HD>

          <P>The Bureau's exercise of its statutory authority to create a full exemption from the Dodd-Frank Act prohibition on consumer payment of upfront points and fees maintains the current financial environment in which small creditors operate. Small creditors, and indirectly, loan originator organizations funding their loans through such creditors, have, relative to their larger rivals, limited<PRTPAGE P="11404"/>means of hedging the costs of all the financial (credit and interest rate/prepayment) risk posed to them by the origination of a mortgage. These costs are borne by a creditor retaining such mortgages in its portfolio, but they are also borne by those that sell their mortgages in the secondary market, owing to the lower price investors will pay for mortgage pools with higher credit and prepayment risk.</P>
          <P>Small creditors bear relatively high costs of participating in ancillary markets for financial instruments through which their larger rivals can more easily hedge mortgage risk. The primary means by which these small institutions can hedge this type of risk is by allowing consumers to purchase discount points. The sale of discount points to consumers in exchange for lower interest rates on loans can still cost smaller creditors relatively more, per dollar of current loan value, than their larger rivals, but, to the extent it exists, this relative cost posed to small creditors is far lower than that of using alternative means of hedging. If the Bureau had decided to finalize the prohibition on the payment of discount points, it would have, in combination with current regulatory restrictions on prepayment penalties, entirely eliminated the ability of small institutions to hedge risk at a price that allows them to compete with larger financial institutions. This inability to compete could conceivably have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of small creditors, whether through dissolution or through absorption by larger financial firms.</P>
          <P>This ability to hedge risk through the continued ability of consumers to purchase discount points, however, could inflict losses to small creditors. These losses, while relatively minor in comparison to those benefits previously described, could nevertheless be of significant concern.</P>
          <P>First, limiting the advantage of larger creditors in offering different combinations of points and fees would aid the competitiveness of small creditors.</P>
          <P>Second, small creditors most often serve relatively specialized markets that are distinguished by several criteria, including a relatively more stable consumer base. Implementation of the prohibition on consumer payment of upfront points and fees without exercise of exemption authority could have further increased both the stability and size of this base, by enhancing consumer perceptions of the greater degree of transparency exhibited by small creditors in comparison to larger institutions in the provision of all financial services. Larger creditors, for example, would have an incentive to offset any risk to mortgage profits from the statutory ban on points and fees by charging additional service fees to borrowers, depositors, and other clients. Since small creditors engage in these activities to a lesser extent, implementation of the prohibition on consumer payment of upfront points and fees could have enhanced the favorable reputation of small creditors in all lines of their business, allowing them to preserve their relatively larger percentage of long-term consumer relationships while potentially increasing the size of all of the financial markets they serve.</P>
          <P>Third, even in periods of significant interest rate volatility, small creditors often exhibit a relatively greater willingness to hold mortgages in portfolio rather than selling them in the secondary market, as do larger institutions. This propensity mitigates the need for small creditors to follow the practices imposed by the secondary market on larger creditors. Mortgage pooling, for example, which is necessary to securitization, requires larger creditors to focus on lending to consumers with relatively standard credit profiles. The comparative advantage of smaller creditors in serving consumers exhibiting a wider array of credit histories could conceivably increase when the variety of mortgage products offered by larger creditors decreases and, consequently, the value of diversity in consumers served increases.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Compensation Based on Transaction Terms</HD>
          <P>The final rule clarifies and revises restrictions on profits-based compensation from mortgage-related business profits for loan originators based on the analysis of the potential incentives that loan originators have to steer consumers to different transaction terms in a variety of contexts. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, &#xA7; 1026.3(d)(1)(iii) permits creditors or loan originators organizations to make contributions from mortgage-related profits to &#x201C;designated tax-advantaged plans&#x201D; as listed in that paragraph.</P>
          <P>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) permits creditors or loan originator organizations to make contributions from mortgage-related profits to 401(k) plans, and other &#x201C;designated tax-advantaged plans,&#x201D; such as Simplified Employee Pensions (SEPs) and savings incentive match plans for employees (SIMPLE plans), provided the contributions are not based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions. Section 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) permits creditors or loan originator organizations to pay compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans from mortgage-related business profits if: (1) The individual loan originator is the loan originator for ten or fewer mortgage transactions during the preceding 12 months (a de minimis number of originations); or (2) the percentage of an individual loan originator's compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan is equal to or less than 10 percent of that individual loan originator's total compensation. While such contributions and bonuses can be funded from general mortgage profits, the amounts paid to individual loan originators cannot be based on the terms of the transactions that the individual had originated.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Benefits to Small Entities</HD>
          <P>Small entities have, through outreach and inquiries, expressed concern over the potential costs they could incur owing to their difficulty, particularly in contrast to large institutions, in interpreting the restrictions the existing rule imposes on methods of compensation for individual loan originators, such as compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans paid to individual loan originators or compensation by creditors or loan originator organizations through designated tax-advantaged plans. Small entities will benefit, in both absolute and relative terms, from clarification regarding permissible forms of loan originator compensation. Such clarification will reduce legal and related costs of interpreting the existing rule and the risk of unintended violations of that regulation.</P>
          <P>Small entities engaging in compensating individual loan originators through contributions to designated tax-advantaged plans in which the individual loan originators participate will also continue to benefit from this practice under the final rule. Those small entities that do not currently offer such plans would benefit, with the increased clarity of the final rule, from the opportunity to do so should they so choose.<SU>194</SU>

            <FTREF/>For small entities that currently do not pay bonuses out of mortgage-related profits<PRTPAGE P="11405"/>because of uncertainty about the application of the existing rule, the final rule will allow these types of compensation up to the 10-percent cap or under the de minimis exception. A final benefit is provided to those small entities that have working for them individual loan originators who are the loan originators for no more than 10 transactions per year, owing to the de minimis provision in the final rule that exempts these employees from limitations on profits-based bonuses. The Bureau believes that small entities are more likely than larger institutions to have producing managers or other employees whose day-to-day responsibilities are diverse and fluid, in which case they are more likely to act as a loan originator on occasion outside of their primary or secondary responsibilities. As a result, small entities for which such individuals work, as well as the individuals themselves, would benefit from the de minimis exception to allow their participation in profits-based compensation from mortgage-related business profits for which they might otherwise not be eligible under the other restrictions in the final rule.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>194</SU>Some firms may choose not to offer such compensation. In certain circumstances an originating institution (perhaps unable to invest in sufficient management expertise) will see reduced profitability from adopting profits-based compensation plans.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Costs to Small Entities</HD>
          <P>Small entities that currently compensate their individual loan originators through profits-based compensation, such as by compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan limited by the final rule, will incur compliance costs if they currently pay, or wish to pay in the future, compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan to individual loan originators outside of the 10-percent cap or the de minimis exception set forth in the final rule. Small entities that currently compensate individual loan originators through non-deferred profits-based compensation in excess of 10 percent of individual loan originators' total compensation might have to adjust their profits-based compensation to comply with the 10-percent total compensation test under the final rule. This cost to comply will likely be minimal to nominal, however, because the final rule allows firms to pay profits-based compensation from non-mortgage related business above the 10-percent limits so long as those profits are determined in accordance with reasonable accounting methods and the compensation is not based on the terms of that individual's residential mortgage transactions. Thus, this would presumably create a compliance cost only for small entities that do not currently utilize reasonable accounting methods for internal accounting or other purposes: For these entities, the costs of compliance with the final rule could include making needed revisions to internal accounting practices, re-negotiating the remuneration terms in the contracts of individual loan originators currently working for the small entity, and updating any other practices essential to these methods of compensation. Owing to their current usage of these compensation programs, these firms may encounter higher retention costs and possibly lower levels of ability on the part of new hires, relative to the average ability displayed by the loan originators they currently employ.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Loan Originator Qualification Requirements</HD>
          <P>The final rule implements a Dodd-Frank Act provision requiring both individual loan originators and loan originator organizations to be &#x201C;qualified&#x201D; and to include their license or registration numbers on loan documents. Loan originator organizations are required to ensure that individual loan originators who work for them are licensed or registered under the SAFE Act where applicable. Loan originator organizations and the individual loan originators that are primarily responsible for a particular transaction are required to list their license or registration numbers on key loan documents along with their names. Loan originator organizations are required to ensure that their loan originator employees meet applicable character, fitness, and criminal background check requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Benefits to Small Entities</HD>
          <P>Benefits from an enhanced reputation among consumers will accrue to those small entities employing originators not currently required to be licensed under the SAFE Act. Increased consumer confidence in such institutions arises from the knowledge that the small entity has ensured that the loan originators it employs have satisfied training requirements commensurate with their responsibilities as originators and they have met the character, fitness, and criminal background check requirements similar to those specified for licensees in the SAFE Act.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Costs to Small Entities</HD>
          <P>The final rule requires small entities, such as many depositories and bona fide nonprofit organizations, to adopt standards similar to those of the SAFE Act in regard to ongoing training, and the satisfaction of character and fitness standards, including having no felony convictions within the previous seven years. The Bureau estimates the costs of compliance with these standards to include the cost of obtaining a criminal background check and credit reports for new hires and existing employees who were not screened at the time of hire, and the time involved in checking employment and character references of any such individuals and evaluating the information. The additional time and cost required to provide occasional, appropriate training to individual loan originators will vary as a consequence of the skill and experience level of those individuals.</P>
          <P>The Bureau believes that virtually all small depositories and nonprofit organizations have already adopted such screening and training requirements as a matter of good business practice and the Bureau anticipates that the training that many individual originators employed by small depositories and nonprofits already receive will be adequate to meet the requirement. The Bureau expects that in no case would the training needed to satisfy the requirement be more comprehensive, time-consuming, or costly than the online training approved by the NMLSR to satisfy the continuing education requirement imposed under the SAFE Act on those individuals who are subject to state licensing.</P>
          <P>The requirement to include the names and NMLSR identifiers of originators on loan documents may impose some additional costs relative to current practice. These costs, however, may be mitigated by the existing requirement of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to include the NMLSR numerical identifier of individual loan originators and loan originator organizations on all applications for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">d. Other Provisions</HD>

          <P>The final rule adjusts existing rules governing compensation to loan originators in connection with closed-end mortgage transactions to implement Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA, to provide greater clarity on the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule, and to provide loan originator increased flexibility to engage in certain compensation practices. These provisions prohibit the compensation of loan originators by both consumers and other persons in the same transaction. They also preserve the current prohibition on the payment or receipt of commissions or other compensation based on the &#x201C;transaction terms&#x201D; governing the mortgage loan or factors that, for purposes of compensation,<PRTPAGE P="11406"/>serve an equivalent role and may consequently be regarded as &#x201C;proxies&#x201D; for any of these transactions terms. The final rule, however, clarifies the existing prohibition by providing a new and explicit definition of a &#x201C;term of a transaction&#x201D; and explicitly addresses the criteria that determine whether a factor appearing in the loan is prohibited by its role as a proxy for a loan term and serving as a basis for compensation.</P>

          <P>The final rule also clarifies several additional aspects of compensation provided to a loan originator. First, the final rule revises the existing rule to allow &#x201C;broker splits&#x201D; by permitting a loan originator organization receiving compensation directly from a consumer in connection with a given transaction to pay and an individual loan originator to receive compensation in connection with this transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission). Second, the final rule clarifies that payments to a loan originator paid on the consumer's behalf by a person other than a creditor or its affiliates, such as a non-creditor seller, home builder, home improvement contractor, or real estate broker, are considered compensation received directly from the consumer if they are made pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the person other than the creditor or its affiliates. Third, the final rule allows reductions in loan originator compensation where there are unforeseen circumstances to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an increase in the actual settlement cost above an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA or omitted from that disclosure.</P>
          <P>These provisions will provide greater clarity and flexibility, relative to the statutory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, for the purposes of compliance with the final rule. They should lower the costs of compliance for small entities. The final rule's allowance of broker splits, for example, provides small entities a greater degree of flexibility in their choice of compensation practices than under the 2010 Loan Originator Rule. Small entities, by virtue of their size, often have a disadvantage in competing with larger institutions in the market for skilled labor. The final rule will, as a consequence, lower the overall costs incurred by the small entity in retaining the individual loan originators they currently employ as well as the hiring of new originators. Greater clarity provided by the final rule in the definition of a &#x201C;term of a transaction&#x201D; and by explicitly addressing factors on which compensation cannot be based because they are &#x201C;proxies&#x201D; for a term of a transaction, will significantly reduce the uncertainty faced by small entities in their adoption of compensation procedures and in negotiating compensation with individual loan originators. They also serve, at the same time, to reduce the risk to small entities, particularly in relation to large institutions employing specialized staff, of unintentional violations of prohibited compensation practices. The final rule also bestows a similar benefit to small entities, in regard to the risk and consequent costs of unintentional noncompliance, by clarifying the nature of payments to an individual originator from unaffiliated third parties in a loan transaction which serve as compensation paid by the consumer to that individual.</P>
          <P>The final rule also implements the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that prohibits mandatory arbitration clauses in mortgage loan agreements. It also implements the Dodd-Frank Act requirement concerning waivers of Federal claims in court. Finally, the final rule implements the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that prohibit the financing of single-premium credit insurance. Firms may incur some costs to comply with each of these prohibitions, such as amending standard contract forms.</P>

          <P>Section 603(b)(4) of the RFA requires an estimate of the classes of small entities that will be subject to the requirements. The classes of small entities that will be subject to the reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements of the final rule are the same classes of small entities that are identified above in part VIII.</P>
          <P>Section 603(b)(4) of the RFA also requires an estimate of the type of professional skills necessary for the preparation of the reports or records. The Bureau anticipates that the professional skills required for compliance with the final rule are the same or similar to those required in the ordinary course of business of the small entities affected by the final rule. Compliance by the small entities that will be affected by the final rule will require continued performance of the basic functions that they perform today.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Description of the Steps the Agency Has Taken To Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Upfront Points and Fees</HD>

          <P>The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits consumer payment of upfront points and fees in all residential mortgage loan transactions (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) except those where no one other than the consumer pays a loan originator compensation tied to the transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission). As discussed in the Background and section-by-section analysis, the Bureau adopts in the final rule a complete exemption to the statutory ban on upfront points and fees under its Dodd-Frank Act authority to create such an exemption in the interest of consumers and in the public interest, and other authority. Specifically, the final rule amends &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(2)(ii) to provide that a payment to a loan originator that is otherwise prohibited by section 129B(c)(2)(A) of TILA is nevertheless permitted pursuant to section 129B(c)(2)(B) of TILA, regardless of whether the consumer makes any upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees, as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(ii) of TILA, as long as the mortgage originator does not receive any compensation directly from the consumer as described in section 129B(c)(2)(B)(i) of TILA. The Bureau has attempted to mitigate the burden of the more limited exemption in the proposal that would have required creditors or loan originator organizations to generally make available an alternative loan without discount points or origination points or fees, where they offer a loan with discount points or origination points or fees.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Compensation Based on Transaction Terms</HD>

          <P>The final rule clarifies and revises restrictions on profits-based compensation from mortgage-related business profits for loan originators, depending on the potential incentives to steer consumers to different transaction terms. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, the final rule permits creditors or loan origination organizations to make contributions from profits derived from mortgage-related business to 401(k) plans, and other &#x201C;designated tax-advantaged plans&#x201D; as long as the compensation is not based on the terms of that individual loan originator's residential mortgage loan transactions. Because these designated plans include Simplified Employee Pensions (SEPs) and savings incentive match plans for employees (SIMPLE plans) that may<PRTPAGE P="11407"/>particularly benefit small entities who are eligible to set them up, the impact of this provision on small entities is minimized.</P>
          <P>The final rule also permits creditors or loan originator organizations to pay non-deferred profits-based compensation from mortgage-related business profits if the compensation is not based on the terms of that individual loan originator's residential mortgage loan transactions and if: (1) The individual loan originator affected has been the loan originator for ten or fewer mortgage transactions during the prior 12 months; or (2) the percentage of an individual loan originator's compensation that may be attributable to the bonuses is equal to or less than 10 percent of that loan originator's total compensation. The Bureau attempted to minimize the burden of these requirements by modifying the final rule from the proposed requirements in two respects.</P>

          <P>First, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed revenue test and is instead adopting the 10-percent total compensation test. The Bureau believes that, relative to the revenue test, the 10-percent total compensation test reduces the cost of the compensation restrictions to small entities. As described earlier in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau received a number of comments asserting that the revenue test would disadvantage creditors and loan originator organizations that are monoline mortgage businesses. The revenue test would have effectively precluded monoline mortgage businesses from paying profits-based bonuses to their individual loan originators or making contributions to those individuals' non-designated plans because these institutions' mortgage-related revenues as a percentage of total revenues would always exceed 25 or 50 percent (the alternative thresholds proposed). A test focused on compensation at the individual loan originator level, rather than company-wide, would be available to all companies regardless of the diversity of their business lines. Further, as the Bureau noted in the Small Business Review Panel Outline (and as stated by at least one commenter), creditors and loan originator organizations that are monoline mortgage businesses disproportionately consist of small entities. Unlike the revenue test, the 10-percent total compensation test will place restrictions on profits-based compensation (such as non-deferred profits-based compensation) that are neutral across entity size. The Bureau also believes that the relative simplicity of the 10-percent total compensation test in comparison to the revenue test&#x2014;<E T="03">e.g.,</E>calculation of total revenues is not required&#x2014;will also benefit small entities.</P>

          <P>Second, the Bureau, as described in the section-by-section analysis above, has increased the threshold of the de minimis origination exception under &#xA7; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) from five to ten consummated transactions. As noted earlier in this FRFA, the Bureau believes that small entities are more likely than larger institutions to have producing managers or other employees whose day-to-day responsibilities are diverse and fluid, in which case they are more likely to act as loan originators on occasion outside of their primary or secondary responsibilities. As a result, small entities for which such individuals work, as well as the individuals themselves, would benefit from the de minimis exception to allow their participation in non-deferred profits-based compensation from mortgage-related business profits for which they might otherwise not be eligible under the other restrictions in the final rule. The final rule has expanded slightly the scope of this exception to capture potentially more individuals who work for covered persons, including small entities.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Broker Splits</HD>

          <P>The final rule revises the existing Loan Originator Rule to provide that if a loan originator organization receives compensation directly from a consumer in connection with a transaction, the loan originator organization may pay compensation in connection with the transaction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>a commission) to individual loan originators and the individual loan originators may receive compensation from the loan originator organization. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis, this mitigates the burden of the existing rule on loan originator organizations.</P>

          <P>At the Small Business Review Panel Outreach Meeting, the Bureau asked the Small Entity Representatives a series of questions regarding any potential increase in the cost of business credit.

          <P>In the IRFA, the Bureau asked interested parties to provide data and other factual information regarding whether the proposed rule would have any impact on the cost of credit for small entities. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. In summary, the Bureau believes that the Final Rule will leave the cost of credit paid by small entities unchanged from its current value and, as a consequence, avoid those additional costs to those entities, created by an inability to hedge mortgage risk and other restrictions, that are an inevitable consequence under the baseline.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Overview</HD>

          <P>The Bureau's collection of information requirements contained in this rule, and identified as such, were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501,<E T="03">et seq.</E>) (Paperwork Reduction Act or PRA). Further, the PRA (44 U.S.C 3507(a), (a)(2) and (a)(3)) requires that a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless OMB approved the collection under the PRA and the OMB control number obtained is displayed. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to comply with, or is subject to any penalty for failure to comply with, a collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control number (44 U.S.C. 3512).</P>

          <P>This Final Rule contains revised information collection requirements that have not been approved by the OMB and, therefore, are not effective until OMB approval is obtained. The information collection requirements contained in this rule are described below. The Bureau will publish a separate notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing the submission of these information collection requirements to OMB as well as OMB's action on these submissions; including, the OMB control number and expiration date.</P>
          <P>This rule amends 12 CFR Part 1026 (Regulation Z). Regulation Z currently contains collections of information approved by OMB, and the Bureau's OMB control number is 3170-0015 (Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) 12 CFR 1026). As described below, the rule amends certain collections of information currently in Regulation Z.</P>

          <P>On September 7, 2012, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(77 FR 55271). In the proposed rule, the Bureau invited comment on: (1) Whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Bureau, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collections of information; (3) how to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) how to minimize the burden of complying with the proposed collections of information, including the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. The comment period for the proposed rule expired on November 6, 2012. In conjunction with the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Bureau received one comment addressing the Bureau's PRA analysis. This comment, received from a nonprofit loan originator organization, related to the Bureau's estimated number of respondents and is discussed in section B(2)(b) below.</P>

          <P>The title of this information collection is: Loan Originator Compensation. The frequency of response is on-occasion. The information collection required provides benefits for consumers and is mandatory.<E T="03">See</E>15 U.S.C. 1601,<E T="03">et seq.</E>Because the Bureau does not collect any information under the rule, no issue of confidentiality arises. The likely respondents are commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage companies (non-bank creditors), mortgage brokers, and nonprofit organizations that make or broker closed-end mortgage loans for consumers.</P>
          <P>Under the rule, the Bureau generally accounts for the paperwork burden associated with Regulation Z for the following respondents pursuant to its administrative enforcement authority: insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets, their depository institution affiliates, and certain non-depository loan originator organizations. The Bureau and the FTC generally both have administrative enforcement authority over non-depository institutions for Regulation Z. Accordingly, the Bureau has allocated to itself half of its estimated burden for non-depository institutions. Other Federal agencies, including the FTC, are responsible for estimating and reporting to OMB the total paperwork burden for the institutions for which they have administrative enforcement authority. They may, but are not required, to use the Bureau's burden estimation methodology.</P>
          <P>It should be noted that the Bureau's estimation of burdens arising from those provisions of the final rule regarding loan originator qualifications takes into account the prior screening activities in which, the Bureau believes, most loan originator organizations have previously engaged, including obtaining credit reports, criminal background checks, and information about prior administrative, civil, or criminal findings by any government jurisdiction actions. This estimation of burdens, consequently, avoids including any costs associated with performing criminal background, financial responsibility, character, and general fitness standards for individual loan originators that loan originator organizations had already hired and screened prior to the effective date of this final rule under the then-applicable statutory or regulatory background standards, except for those individual loan originators already employed but about whom the loan originator organization knows of reliable information indicating that the individual loan originator likely no longer meets the required standards, regardless of when that individual was hired and screened.<SU>198</SU>
            <FTREF/>
          </P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>198</SU>The final rule clarifies, in &#xA7; 1026.36(f)(3)(i) and (ii) and in new comments 36(f)(3)(ii)-2 and 36(f)(3)(ii)-3, that these requirements apply for an individual that the loan originator organization hires on or after January 10, 2014, the effective date of these provisions, as well as for individuals hired prior to this date who were not screened under standards in effect at the time of hire.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>Using the Bureau's burden estimation methodology, the total estimated burden for the approximately 22,800 institutions subject to the rule, including Bureau respondents,<SU>199</SU>

            <FTREF/>is approximately 64,600 hours annually and 164,700 one-time hours. The aggregate estimates of total burden presented in this part IX are based on estimated costs that are averages across respondents. The Bureau expects that<PRTPAGE P="11409"/>the amount of time required to implement each of the changes for a given institution may vary based on the size, complexity, and practices of the respondent.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>199</SU>There are 153 depository institutions (and their depository affiliates) that are subject to the Bureau's administrative enforcement authority. In addition there are 146 privately insured credit unions that are subject to the Bureau's administrative enforcement authority. For purposes of this PRA analysis, the Bureau's respondents under Regulation Z are 135 depository institutions that originate closed-end mortgages; 77 privately insured credit unions that originate closed-end mortgages; an estimated 2,787 non-depository institutions that originate closed-end mortgages and that are subject to the Bureau's administrative enforcement authority, an assumed 230 not-for profit originators (which may overlap with the other non-depository creditors), and 8,051 loan originator organizations. Unless otherwise specified, all references to burden hours and costs for the Bureau respondents for the collection under Regulation Z are based on a calculation that includes one half of burden for all respondents except the depository institutions.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Information Collection Requirements</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Record Retention Requirements</HD>
          <P>Regulation Z currently requires creditors to create and maintain records to demonstrate their compliance with Regulation Z provisions regarding compensation paid to or received by a loan originator. As discussed above in part V, the final rule requires creditors to retain these records for a three-year period, rather than for a two-year period as currently required. The rule applies the same requirement to organizations when they act as a loan originator in a transaction, even if they do not act as a creditor in the transaction.</P>
          <P>For the requirement extending the record retention requirement for creditors from two years, as currently provided in Regulation Z, to three years, the Bureau assumes that there is no additional marginal cost. For most, if not all firms, the required records are in electronic form. The Bureau believes that, as a consequence, all creditors should be able to use their existing recordkeeping systems to maintain the required documentation for mortgage origination records for one additional year at a negligible cost of investing in new storage facilities.</P>
          <P>Loan originator organizations, but not creditors, will incur costs from the new requirement to retain records related to compensation. For the requirement that organizations retain records related to compensation on loan transactions, these firms will need to build the requisite reporting regimes. At some firms this may require the integration of information technology systems; for others simple reports can be generated from existing core systems.</P>
          <P>For the roughly 8,000 Bureau respondents that are non-depository loan originator organizations but not creditors, the one-time burden is estimated to total approximately 163,400 hours, or approximately 20 hours per organization, to review the regulation and establish the requisite systems to retain compensation information. The Bureau estimates the requirement for these Bureau respondents to retain documentation of compensation arrangements is assumed to require 64,400 ongoing burden hours, or approximately 8 hours per organization, annually. The Bureau has allocated to itself one-half of this burden.</P>
          <P>Those record-keeping requirements that would have arisen had the Bureau chosen to retain in its final rule the proposed requirement to make available a zero-zero alternative are now absent. The overall burden to covered persons created by this final rule, however, remains unchanged, since the Bureau found no additional cost or burden was created by that earlier provision.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Requirement To Obtain Criminal Background Checks, Credit Reports, and Other Information for Certain Individual Loan Originators</HD>
          <P>To the extent loan originator organizations hire new originators who are not required to be licensed under the SAFE Act, and who are not so licensed, the loan originator organizations are required to obtain a criminal background check and credit report for these individual loan originators. Loan originator organizations are also required to obtain from the NMLSR or individual loan originator information about any findings against such individual loan originator by a government jurisdiction. In general, the loan originator organizations that are subject to this requirement are depository institutions (including credit unions) and bona fide nonprofit organizations whose loan originators are not subject to State licensing because the State has determined to provide an exemption for bona fide nonprofit organizations and determined the organization to be a bona fide nonprofit organization. The burden of obtaining this information may be different for a depository institution than it is for a nonprofit organization because depository institutions already obtain criminal background checks for their loan originators to comply with Regulation G and have access to information about findings against such individual loan originator by a government jurisdiction through the NMLSR.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">a. Credit Check</HD>
          <P>Both depository institutions and nonprofit organizations will incur costs related to obtaining credit reports for all loan originators that are hired or transfer into this function on or after January 10, 2014. For the estimated 370 Bureau respondents, which include depository institutions over $10 billion, their depository affiliates, and nonprofit nondepository organizations, the estimated one time burden is roughly 25 hours and the estimated on going burden is 90 hours. This includes the total burden for the depository institutions and one-half the estimated burdens for the nonprofit nondepository organizations.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Criminal Background Check</HD>
          <P>Nonprofit organizations will incur costs related to obtaining criminal background checks for all loan originators that are hired or transfer into this function on or after January 10, 2014. Depository institutions already obtain criminal background checks for each of their individual loan originators through the NMLSR for purposes of complying with Regulation G. A criminal background check provided by the NMLSR to the depository institution is sufficient to meet the requirement to obtain a criminal background check in this rule. Accordingly, the Bureau believes they will not incur any additional burden.</P>
          <P>Non-depository loan originator organizations that do not have access to information about criminal history in the NMLSR, including bona fide nonprofit organizations, could satisfy the latter requirements by obtaining a national criminal background check.<SU>200</SU>
            <FTREF/>For the assumed 200 nonprofit originators,<SU>201</SU>
            <FTREF/>the one-time burden is estimated to be roughly 20 hours.<SU>202</SU>
            <FTREF/>The ongoing cost to perform the check for new hires is estimated to be 10 hours annually. The Bureau has allocated to itself one-half of these burdens.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>200</SU>This check, more formally known as an individual's FBI Identification Record, uses the individual's fingerprint submission to collect information about prior arrests and, in some instances, federal employment, naturalization, or military service.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>201</SU>The Bureau has not been able to determine how many loan originators organizations qualify as bona fide nonprofit organizations or how many of their employee loan originators are not subject to SAFE Act licensing. Accordingly, the Bureau has estimated these numbers.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <FTNT>
            <P>

              <SU>202</SU>The organizations are also assumed to pay $50 to get a national criminal background check. Several commercial services offer an inclusive fee, ranging between $48.00 and $50.00, for fingerprinting, transmission, and FBI processing. Based on a sample of three FBI-approved services, accessed on 2012-08-02: Accurate Biometrics, available at:<E T="03">http://www.accuratebiometrics.com/index.asp</E>; Daon Trusted Identity Servs., available at:<E T="03">http://daon.com/prints</E>; and Fieldprint,<E T="03">available at http://www.fieldprintfbi.com/FBISubPage_FullWidth.aspx?ChannelID=272</E>.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The Bureau did receive one comment from a nonprofit firm primarily involved in the purchase and rehabilitation of HUD-FHA REO homes, which queried the definition of a nonprofit firm used by the Bureau in its calculations. The Bureau included all affiliates and regional offices of a parent nonprofit firm in its original estimate of 200 such firms that would be covered by the rule. After receiving this comment, however, the Bureau engaged in extensive research in order to create,<PRTPAGE P="11410"/>from information provided by government and private sources, a national census of nonprofit loan originators currently in operation. Such a census is currently unavailable from any public or private source. Based on this research, the Bureau found no evidence to support a change in its original estimate and continues to treat all affiliates and regional offices of a parent nonprofit firm as one respondent. The Bureau's research on the number of nonprofit firms covered by the rule is, however, ongoing.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">c. Information About Findings Against the Individual by Government Jurisdictions</HD>
          <P>The information for employees of nonprofit organizations is generally not in the NMLSR. Accordingly, under the rule a nonprofit organization will have to obtain this information using individual statements concerning any prior administrative, civil, or criminal findings. For the employees of bona-fide nonprofit organizations, the Bureau estimates that no more than 10 percent have any such findings by a governmental jurisdiction to describe. The one-time burden is estimated to be 20 hours, and the annual burden to obtain the information from new hires is estimated to be two hours. The Bureau has allocated to itself one-half of these burdens.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Summary of Burden Hours</HD>
          <P>For all of the collections herein, the one-time burden for Bureau respondents is approximately 81,800 hours. The on-going burden is approximately 32,300 hours.</P>
          <P>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a continuing interest in the public's opinions of our collections of information.
