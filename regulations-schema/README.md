# eRegs XML Schema

The goal of this project is to develop an XML Schema Definition that will power the [eRegulations](http://cfpb.github.io/eRegulations/) project.

The XSD is intended to capture the semantics of the regulations, both in terms of their structure and their content (e.g. things like citations and references). The XML generated in conformity with this XSD will be guaranteed to parse properly in the new eRegs parser tool that is being developed alongside this schema.
