A Public Guidance Document entitled \u201cConsumer Disclosure for Voluntary Escrow Account Payments\u201d provides a model disclosure format that originators and servicers are encouraged, but not required, to provide to consumers when the originator or servicer anticipates a substantial increase in disbursements from the escrow account after the first year of the loan.
