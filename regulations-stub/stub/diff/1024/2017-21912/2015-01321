A servicer complies with \u00a7 1024.36(d) by responding to an information request for the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan by identifying the person on whose behalf the servicer receives payments from the borrower. Although investors or guarantors, including among others the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association, may be exposed to risks related to the mortgage loans held by a trust either in connection with an investment in securities issued by the trust or the issuance of a guaranty agreement to the trust, such investors or guarantors are not the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans solely as a result of their roles as such. In certain circumstances, however, a party such as a guarantor may assume multiple roles for a securitization transaction. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association may act as trustee, master servicer, and guarantor in connection with a securitization transaction in which a trust owns a mortgage loan subject to a request. In this example, because the Federal National Mortgage Association is the trustee of the trust that owns the mortgage loan, a servicer complies with \u00a7 1024.36(d) by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by providing the name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association as the trustee. The following examples identify the owner or assignee for different forms of mortgage loan ownership:"
