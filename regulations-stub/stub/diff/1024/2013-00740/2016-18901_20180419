To illustrate, assume that on January 2, the servicer sends the notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1)(i).

On February 5, the servicer receives evidence demonstrating the borrower has hazard insurance effective since 12:01 a.m. on January 31.

For example, if a borrower makes a monthly payment in February for a mortgage loan, but asserts an error relating to the servicer's acceptance of the February payment, \u00a7 1024.35(h) does not alter a borrower's obligation to make a monthly payment that the borrower owes for March. A servicer, however, may not require that a borrower make the March payment as a condition for complying with its obligations under \u00a7 1024.35 with respect to the notice of error on the February payment.",

For example, a borrower may submit a letter that claims to be a \u201cNotice of Error\u201d that indicates that the borrower wants to receive the information set forth in an annual escrow account statement and asserts an error for the servicer's failure to provide the borrower an annual escrow statement. Such a letter may constitute an information request under \u00a7 1024.36(a) that triggers an obligation by the servicer to provide an annual escrow statement. A servicer should not rely on the borrower's characterization of the letter as a \u201cNotice of Error,\u201d but must evaluate whether the letter fulfills the substantive requirements of a notice of error, information request, or both.",
