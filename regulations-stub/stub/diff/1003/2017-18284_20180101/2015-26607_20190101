For example, if the appropriate Federal agency for an institution required to comply with \u00a7 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) changes during February 2020, the institution must identify its new appropriate Federal agency beginning with its quarterly submission pursuant to \u00a7 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) for the first quarter of 2020.
