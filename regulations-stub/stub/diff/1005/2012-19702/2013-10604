Section 1005.32(b)(3)-1 additionally permits a provider to disclose an estimate of such fees and taxes, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. See comment 32(b)(3).  For example, a provider may know that the designated recipient's institution imposes an incoming wire fee for receiving a transfer.  Alternatively, a provider may know that foreign taxes will be collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.  In these examples, the provider may choose, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee and tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The provider must not include that fee or tax in the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).  Fees and taxes disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. See comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.  Estimates of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider must be disclosed in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3).",

Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h).

For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  Account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Where an incoming remittance transfer results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a remittance transfer.  Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer.  For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer is not a fee imposed upon the remittance transfer.  Fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself.  For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' accounts, but not on preferred accounts, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a remittance transfer.  Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the remittance transfer regardless of how many remittance transfers preceded it that month.",
