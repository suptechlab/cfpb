    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is amending Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers), which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the official interpretation to the regulation. In December 2012, Congress passed and the President signed legislation amending the EFTA to eliminate a requirement that a fee notice be posted on or at automated teller machines, leaving in place the requirement for a specific fee disclosure to appear on the screen of that machine or on paper issued from the machine. This final rule amends Regulation E to conform to the EFTA amendment.",

        "11": "The Bureau found only one study of awareness, which is over a decade old. A 2000 consumer survey commissioned by an ATM network (PULSE) found that 86 percent of consumers surveyed said they were adequately informed of charges they sometimes pay to withdraw cash from ATMs. The PULSE network, Pulsations (May 2000). Moreover, 96 percent of consumers who said they paid a surcharge in the last 14 days reported feeling that ATM fee disclosures were sufficient. The Bureau believes this survey has limited value since respondents may have felt disclosures were adequate but have been ignorant of the fees. Moreover, it is possible that consumers claimed awareness in part because they had read the notice \u201con or at\u201d the ATM. However, the Bureau believes that whatever the level of awareness of foreign institution fees, the level will not drop significantly when the notice on or at the ATM is removed. The on-screen disclosure is clear and pointed and requires the consumer affirmatively to accept the fee before proceeding.", 
        "10": "Specifically, section 1022(b)(2)(A) calls for the Bureau to consider the potential benefits and costs of a regulation to consumers and covered persons, including the potential reduction of access by consumers to consumer financial products or services; the impact on depository institutions and credit unions with $10 billion or less in total assets as described in section 1026 of the Act; and the impact on consumers in rural areas. The manner and extent to which the provisions of section 1022(b)(2) apply to a rule of this kind are unclear. Nevertheless, to inform this rulemaking more fully, the Bureau performed the described analyses and consultations.",
