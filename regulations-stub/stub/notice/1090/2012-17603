                "Criteria. As noted in the Proposal, the Bureau has broad discretion in choosing criteria for measuring whether a nonbank entity is a larger participant of any given market. In issuing the Proposal, the Bureau considered several criteria for measuring participants of the consumer reporting market. These included, among others, annual receipts; number of unique consumer reports sold or otherwise provided to a third party annually; number of individual consumers a nonbank covered person collects, analyzes, and maintains data about, or provides consumer reports on, annually; and number of employees.",
                "The Bureau proposed to use annual receipts as the measure of participation in the consumer reporting market. As explained in the Proposal, the Bureau believes that annual receipts resulting from consumer reporting activities is a reasonable indication of a person's level of market participation and impact on consumers. Consumer reporting entities earn income from selling consumer reports and from other market-related activities that directly affect consumers. As a result, the greater the annual receipts of a consumer reporting entity, the greater its market participation and the greater its impact on consumers.",
                "In addition, as set forth in the Proposal, the proposed definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d is adapted from the existing measure used by the SBA. Because the SBA uses a similar measure in its small business loan programs,the proposed test is expected to be sufficiently straightforward so as not to put undue burden on nonbank covered persons in determining whether they are subject to the Bureau's nonbank supervision program. However, it bears noting that the Bureau's definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d differs from the SBA's in important respects. For example, as discussed below, the Bureau's rule counts only receipts resulting from activities in the identified consumer reporting market; the SBA, by contrast, counts all receipts of entities engaged in certain consumer reporting activities. This difference excludes some receipts from the amount being counted toward the threshold that marks a larger participant.",
                "As further explained in the Proposal, the Bureau analyzed data from the 2007 Economic Census on annual receipts for businesses in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561450 (credit bureaus). One commenter noted that analyzers may not all be included in this NAICS code. The Bureau acknowledges that the Economic Census data have certain limitations and do not perfectly reflect the set of participants of the market defined by this rule. First, the Proposed Rule's definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d does not correspond precisely to the NAICS code, which encompasses both \u201cconsumer credit reporting agencies\u201d and \u201cmercantile reporting agencies,\u201d\u2009but may not include other participants covered by the final rule's definition of consumer reporting. Second, entities in NAICS code 561450 may report to the Census revenues that are not included in annual receipts resulting from consumer reporting as defined in the rule. Third, entities that fall within the NAICS code may not correctly identify themselves or may otherwise fail to respond to the Census. The Economic Census data are likely therefore both over- and under-inclusive. An additional limitation of the Economic Census data for these codes is that the Census keeps aggregated annual receipts data confidential in certain tiers.Notwithstanding these limitations, the data reveal the general distribution of the size of participants of the consumer reporting market described in the final rule. In the Proposal, the Bureau invited commenters to provide additional data sources. None relevant to the consumer reporting market were identified.",
                "Commenters suggested a variety of alternative criteria such as the total number of unique consumer reports sold, the number of individual consumers on which an entity provides consumer reports, the number of complaints about an entity, an entity's relative market share, or the annual receipts of an entity in a given geographic or demographic segment. The Bureau has broad discretion in choosing criteria to define larger participants of a given market, and does not believe these criteria are superior alternatives. The available data do not permit the Bureau meaningfully to measure the general contours of the market based on these criteria and thus to devise a test for defining larger participants of the consumer reporting market on the basis of them or to apply the test efficiently. Further, as set forth in the Proposal, the Bureau believes that the number of employees is not a suitable alternative criterion because it could be difficult for a multi-line company to apportion employee time between market-related and other activities, and many responsibilities may be fulfilled by contractors rather than employees.",
                "Several commenters in or representing the consumer report reseller industry asserted that using annual receipts would result in double counting of cost of goods sold and thus result in the rule's covering much smaller businesses than intended. As discussed in connection with the definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d above, the cost of goods sold is not double counted.",
                "For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau declines to amend the Proposed Rule to change the criterion used in the larger-participant test for the consumer reporting market and adopts the use of annual receipts as proposed.",
                "Threshold. As noted in the Proposal, the Bureau has broad discretion in setting the threshold above which a nonbank covered person will qualify as a larger participant of the consumer reporting market. The Bureau proposed more than $7 million in annual receipts as the threshold to define larger participants of the consumer reporting market and adopts this threshold in the final rule for the following reasons.",
                "Available data indicate that a threshold of $7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting activities will enable the Bureau to cover in its nonbank supervision program the largest consumer reporting repositories as well as a range of other larger consumer reporting entities that play an important role in the consumer financial marketplace. Coverage likely will include a number of larger specialty consumer reporting agencies, resellers, and analyzers. The Bureau believes that this threshold will cover a sufficient number of market participants to enable the Bureau effectively to assess compliance and identify and assess risks to consumers, but at the same time cover only entities that can reasonably be considered \u201clarger\u201d participants of the market.",
                "As explained in the Proposal, while there are hundreds of consumer reporting entities, according to the 2007 Economic Census, a threshold of more than $7 million in annual receipts will cover approximately 30 consumer reporting entities, or 7 percent of market participants. The Bureau continues to estimate that a threshold of more than $7 million will cover approximately 30 out of 410 consumer reporting agencies,which collectively generate 94 percent of industry receipts among consumer reporting agencies.However, some of those consumer reporting entities may be specialty consumer reporting agencies providing, for example, consumer reports only for employment background screening or rental decisions. As noted above, such entities do not come within the market as defined by the final rule. For comparison, the Bureau estimates that the median value of annual receipts in this industry is less than $500,000, significantly below the proposed threshold.Thus, the rule plainly brings within the scope of Bureau supervision only consumer reporting entities that can reasonably be described as larger participants of the consumer reporting market.",
                "As explained in the Proposal, the threshold of more than $7 million in annual receipts is consistent with the objective of supervising market participants that have a significant impact on consumers, in terms of the number of consumers affected by their operations. In the consumer reporting industry, prices range from two to three cents for prescreening products, from seven cents to sixty two cents for credit scores, and from one to two dollars for consumer reports, while some specialty reports may cost several dollars.Thus, a company with more than $7 million in annual receipts likely impacts several million consumers. Further, as stated above, the entities meeting the proposed threshold generate approximately 94 percent of industry receipts. The Bureau believes that this level of coverage is appropriate in light of the highly concentrated nature of the consumer reporting market and the different types of firms encompassed in the market. For example, based on the more granular Economic Census data recently made available, the Bureau estimates that the six largest consumer reporting entities account for 85 percent of industry receipts. The Bureau believes that there are firms in addition to the largest six entities that have such a high level of participation in the market that they are reasonably deemed larger participants, and thus covering a substantial portion of the annual receipts in this market is warranted.",
                "The Bureau received comments from some consumer groups arguing that the threshold for qualifying as a larger participant of the consumer reporting market should be lowered. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the threshold should be revised to include any firm that has annual receipts of $7 million or more from any source, provided that at least $3.5 million are from consumer reporting\u2014which would effectively lower the threshold for multi-line businesses. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau believes that a threshold of $7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting activities serves the purposes and objectives of the larger-participant supervision program. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to alter the threshold for the consumer reporting market in either manner suggested by these commenters.",
                "As discussed in connection with the definition of \u201cannual receipts,\u201d other commenters suggested raising the threshold from more than $7 million to more than $14 million in annual receipts. The Bureau does not believe that setting the threshold higher than that proposed would result in sufficient coverage of the participants of the consumer reporting market. Defining the larger participants of the consumer reporting market as including more than just the largest firms serves the purposes and objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act. Some consumers may not have files at the largest consumer reporting agencies. Many consumers may not utilize a credit card or checking account, or otherwise participate in mainstream financial activities. As a result, the largest consumer reporting agencies may receive little, if any, data with which to maintain files on these consumers. However, these consumers may utilize alternative financial products such as payday loans or check cashing services, which in some instances may be reported to specialty consumer reporting agencies. Likewise, resellers may have a large impact on consumers in certain credit markets, such as the mortgage market.Setting the threshold too high would make it less likely that the larger resellers and larger specialty consumer reporting entities that compile information about consumers in alternative financial markets would be subject to supervision.",
                "Some commenters argued that the proposed threshold would cover firms with a relatively small amount of earnings. Implicitly, these commenters take issue with the use of annual receipts as a criterion and would prefer earnings as an alternative criterion. As discussed above, the Bureau believes annual receipts reasonably measure market participation and has not identified a superior alternative criterion for measuring such participation. Other commenters pointed out that the $7 million threshold would capture a relatively high percentage of firms in various market segments. The Bureau recognizes that the particular threshold of more than $7 million may capture more or fewer firms in specific market segments within the consumer reporting market. Any threshold that operates market-wide will inevitably draw in more firms in some market segments than in others. Given the range of consumer reporting entities in the consumer reporting market identified by the final rule, the Bureau does not think it is practical to prescribe differing thresholds for more narrowly defined segments of the market. Doing so would effectively segregate the consumer reporting market covered by the final rule, which, for the reasons described above, the Bureau has determined would be inappropriate.",
                "One commenter, referring to the Bureau's supervisory authority, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5515, over \u201cvery large\u201d depository institutions and credit unions, i.e., those with over $10 billion in assets and their affiliates, argued that the Bureau correspondingly should supervise only very large nonbank entities. But the Dodd-Frank Act's division of supervisory authority for insured depository institutions and credit unions does not govern the supervision of nonbank entities. Unlike depository institutions and credit unions that are not subject to Bureau supervision under 12 U.S.C. 5515, nonbanks in the consumer reporting market that are not subject to supervision under 12 U.S.C. 5514 generally will not be subject to other Federal supervision for assessing compliance with Federal consumer financial law or for other purposes. Moreover, 12 U.S.C. 5514 authorizes the Bureau to supervise entities that are \u201clarger\u201d participants in a market, not merely \u201cvery large\u201d participants. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to raise the proposed annual receipts threshold for the consumer reporting market in response to this comment.",
                "The Bureau also received a comment asserting that the proposed threshold would not acknowledge the existence of a middle market in consumer reporting. A pre-existing SBA regulation classifies a business in the consumer reporting market to be a \u201csmall business,\u201d for SBA purposes, if its annual receipts are below $7 million. The commenter argued that if a business with over $7 million in annual receipts is a \u201clarger participant\u201d under the Bureau's rule, then every business in the market is either \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarger,\u201d a result the commenter considered nonsensical.",
                "The commenter appears to have assumed that \u201clarger participants,\u201d in 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2), refers to the absolute size of the businesses in question. That is not how the Bureau understands the term. The Bureau interprets \u201clarger participants\u201d to mean those persons that participate to a relatively large degree in the relevant market. Market participation often increases with the size of a business, but a small business for SBA purposes can in principle be a larger participant, depending on market structure. If the Bureau recognized a market in which all the participants happened to qualify as small businesses, under an SBA definition, that market could still have \u201clarger participants\u201d for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014a result the commenter's assumption would foreclose. As described above, in NAICS code 5614501, corresponding to consumer reporting, the median figure for annual receipts is less than $500,000.Thus, many consumer reporting businesses that qualify as \u201csmall businesses\u201d under the SBA regulation are actually larger than at least 50 percent of market participants.",
                "The Bureau notes that the SBA has proposed to amend its size standard for the category corresponding to consumer reporting.Under the SBA's proposed rule, a consumer reporting business would be a \u201csmall business\u201d if it had $14 million or less in annual receipts. However, even if the SBA finalizes a regulation in accordance with this proposal, that change would not alter the degree to which various entities participate in the consumer reporting market.",
                "Commenters may have misunderstood the relationship between the SBA's size standards and the measurement of \u201clarger participants\u201d of a market because the Bureau adapted its definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d from the SBA's measure. The Bureau chose this approach for the convenience of covered persons. It did not intend, by doing so, to connect the SBA's \u201csmall business\u201d size standard to the Bureau's larger-participant test, or to suggest that $7 million in annual receipts was chosen on that basis.The SBA's measure and the Bureau's threshold are used for different purposes and targeted to different statutory objectives. In setting its size standard, the SBA considers myriad factors\u2014such as eligibility for Federal small-business assistance and Federal contracting programs; startup costs, entry barriers, and industry competition; and technological change\u2009\u2014that differ from the concerns that motivate the Bureau's definition of \u201clarger participants\u201d in this rule. In addition, the Bureau's \u201cannual receipts\u201d criterion differs in important respects from the SBA's. For example, the SBA counts all of a person's receipts in calculating annual receipts, while the Proposed Rule counted only receipts resulting from a market-related activity. Additionally, for purposes of aggregating annual receipts, the SBA and the final rule use different tests to assess whether persons are affiliates. Under the SBA test, one person controls another (thus making the two affiliates), where one person owns at least 50 percent of voting stock of the other. Under the final rule, by contrast, for the reasons explained above, the power to vote 25 percent of a class of securities counts as control. Because of these differences, an entity's receipts as calculated under the SBA regulation may be greater than its receipts for purposes of this rule.",
                "Another consumer reporting industry commenter stated that the Bureau should proceed very cautiously in setting the thresholds for coverage in the consumer reporting market until it has sufficient quantifiable data for establishing these thresholds. Although the Bureau has limited data, as described in the preceding section, the Bureau believes that these data are sufficient to understand the contours of the consumer reporting market and rationally set a threshold for larger participants of the market. In particular, the available data provide detail beyond summary statistics by grouping firms into size tiers, allowing the Bureau to estimate the general distribution of receipts throughout the market. This distribution of receipts, which the Bureau has relied upon for the estimates presented above, is adequate for defining a category of \u201clarger participants.\u201d",
                "In addition, the Bureau believes that one of the purposes of the nonbank supervision program as conceived by Congress is to gather more information about industries as to which little is known as compared to depository institutions. Congress underlined the importance of this effort by setting a one-year deadline for the initial larger participant rule. Thus, the Bureau believes that it should not delay its rulemaking because of imperfect data and acknowledges that the information gained from its supervisory and other activities may lead it to revise its thresholds over time.",
                "Finally, a few commenters recommended that the Bureau index the threshold for annual receipts for inflation. At this time, the Bureau does not intend to index for inflation because, to the extent necessary or appropriate, it expects to make adjustments to the threshold through future rulemakings to reflect not only inflation, but also other shifts in the nature and structure of the consumer reporting market and additional data as it becomes available to the Bureau.",
                "Apportionment. As noted in the Proposal, the Bureau recognizes that there are multi-line companies that derive only a portion of their annual receipts from activities related to the consumer reporting market. The Proposed Rule provided that the only annual receipts to be considered are those \u201cresulting from\u201d activities related to the consumer reporting market.",
                "The Bureau received a number of comments on the issue of apportionment. One consumer reporting industry representative supported the concept of apportionment, but suggested that it would be difficult and unduly burdensome unless the Bureau defines the consumer reporting market in a manner consistent with applicable statutes and industry practices. Another industry representative said that apportionment would present substantial difficulties for multi-line companies because IRS forms generally do not differentiate between income streams within organizations, and a multi-line company will need to perform burdensome calculations beyond the calculations IRS forms require.A group representing attorneys engaged in commercial law stated that the Proposed Rule would likely require participants to overhaul their accounting systems to segregate revenue by activity type, at a significant cost, in order to determine whether they are larger participants or to respond to Bureau assertions on that point. A consumer group suggested that the Bureau should count a company's total annual receipts, from any of its revenue streams, toward the larger-participant threshold. This commenter stated that determining a company's status as a larger participant using total annual receipts would be much simpler than trying to segregate annual receipts from market-related activities, and would serve to prevent evasion by reducing the temptation for companies to misclassify the source of their revenues to avoid supervision. A group representing attorneys recommended that the Bureau provide greater clarity in the definition of the categories of annual receipts to be calculated to put regulated parties on notice of the applicable measurement. Another commenter said that the Bureau should define the term \u201capportionment\u201d and use that definition when describing the aggregation of annual receipts for affiliated companies.",
                "The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit apportionment of annual receipts. In some instances there may be nonbank covered persons that have significantly different business lines, with certain business lines not relating to the consumer reporting market. At the same time, the Bureau acknowledges the concerns regarding burdens associated with apportionment. The Bureau, however, believes that participants of the consumer reporting market are reasonably aware of the sources of their revenue, and should thus be able to apportion without undue burden. Moreover, it bears noting that market participants are not required to apportion their annual receipts on a periodic or other basis under the final rule. On the contrary, the Bureau has decided to permit apportionment, in part, to enable a nonbank covered person to apportion its annual receipts if it wished to challenge an assertion by the Bureau that it qualified as a larger participant. In such a case, the person may provide records, documents or other evidence to the Bureau reasonably identifying that portion of its annual receipts that do not result from market-related activities. Furthermore, if the person wishes not to apportion receipts in challenging such an assertion, it may forego doing so, with the sole result being that it will have higher annual receipts counted toward the $7 million threshold for larger-participant status. Many larger participants would be above the threshold with or without apportionment.",
                "The Bureau does not believe that it would be helpful to provide specific guidance on what accounting methods entities should use to apportion annual receipts. The Bureau believes that nonbank covered persons facing different circumstances may appropriately use different apportionment methods that fairly reflect those circumstances and their business operations. Therefore the Bureau declines to set forth specific requirements or guidance on how to apportion annual receipts. The Bureau also declines to define the term \u201capportionment.\u201d The term is not used in the regulatory text; rather, apportionment is a concept that conveys the inclusion of receipts \u201cresulting from\u201d activities related to the consumer reporting market. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts in the final rule the provision that the only receipts counting toward the calculation of \u201cannual receipts\u201d are those \u201cresulting from\u201d activities related to the covered market."

                "As discussed in the Summary of the Final Rule, above, the consumer reporting market is of fundamental importance to markets for many other consumer financial products and services, affecting hundreds of millions of consumers. The market includes consumer reporting agencies selling comprehensive consumer reports, consumer report resellers, analyzers, and specialty consumer reporting agencies (collectively these market participants are referred to as consumer reporting entities).",
                "Several commenters criticized the Bureau's decision to supervise larger participants of the proposed consumer reporting market. They contended that the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Bureau to consider four specific factors in issuing a rule under 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2): \u201cThe asset size of the covered person,\u201d \u201cthe volume of transactions involving consumer financial products or services in which the covered person engages,\u201d \u201cthe risks to consumers created by the provision of such consumer financial products or services,\u201d and \u201cthe extent to which such institutions are subject to oversight by State authorities for consumer protection.\u201dThese commenters argued that a failure to consider these four factors would be arbitrary and capricious.",
                "The Bureau believes that these commenters have misinterpreted the scope and purpose of 12 U.S.C. 5514(b)(2). That subsection describes how the Bureau must \u201cexercise its authority under paragraph [(b)](1),\u201d\u2009which in turn authorizes the Bureau to supervise \u201cpersons described in subsection (a)(1).\u201d The final rule does not exercise authority provided by subsection (b)(1). Rather, it \u201cdescribe[s],\u201d in part, a set of persons falling within subsection (a)(1), by defining a category of \u201clarger participant[s].\u201d In choosing which persons subject to that authority to supervise, the Bureau will consider the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(2). The Dodd-Frank Act does not mandate consideration of those factors before issuing the rule that establishes the category itself under paragraph (a)(1).",
                "The text of paragraph (b)(2) supports this interpretation. The factors to consider include \u201cthe asset size of the covered person\u201d and the transaction volume of \u201cthe covered person.\u201d These factors are relevant with respect to a particular person being considered for supervision. The reference to a single covered person suggests this provision does not apply to a rule, like the instant one, defining a category of many covered persons.",
                "These commenters also asked the Bureau to explain why it is choosing consumer reporting as the subject of this rule, instead of some other market for a different consumer financial product or service. The Bureau has wide discretion in choosing markets in which to define larger participants. The Bureau need not conclude before issuing a rule defining larger participants of a given market that the market identified in the rule has a higher rate of non-compliance, poses a greater risk to consumers, or is in some other sense more important to supervise than other markets. Indeed, 12 U.S.C. 5514(b)(1), by recognizing that supervision's purposes include assessing compliance and risks posed to consumers, suggests that the Bureau need not determine the level of compliance and risk in a market before issuing a rule that renders larger participants of the market subject to supervision. Choosing consumer reporting as the subject of this rule is reasonable because consumer reporting, as defined in the rule, is an important activity that affects hundreds of millions of consumers and because supervision of larger participants of this market will be beneficial to consumers and markets and will further the Bureau's mission to ensure consumers' access to fair, transparent, and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services."

The Bureau believes that it is important to have sufficient time to undertake and complete supervisory activities, including any necessary follow-up examinations relating to a larger participant, and that less than two years would not be adequate to achieve this goal. Moreover, the threshold is not a precise demarcation of what market participants are \u201clarger.\u201d For example, a firm with annual receipts falling below the threshold for the consumer reporting market may still be a relatively large participant of the market, especially if its annual receipts, calculated using the procedures specified in the final rule, were above the threshold within the previous two years. To conclude that such a firm should still be a larger participant within the Bureau's supervisory authority is consistent with setting the threshold at more than $7 million. Indeed, the two-year period is part of the Bureau's definition of \u201clarger participant,\u201d a fact the Bureau took into account in setting the threshold for the consumer reporting market at more than $7 million in annual receipts. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts \u00a7\u20091090.102, as proposed in \u00a7\u20091090.103 of the Proposed Rule, with minor technical amendments for consistency."

One commenter asked the Bureau to describe the nature of these \u201cvarious data sources.\u201d The Bureau intends to use any data sources that it determines are appropriate, which may include SEC filings, public shareholder information, industry surveys, or data obtained through proprietary sources. In some instances, if sufficient information is not available to the Bureau to assess a person's larger-participant status, the Bureau may, as discussed below, request information to facilitate such an assessment.",
                "As explained in the Proposal, the Bureau recognizes that there may be instances when the Bureau seeks to supervise a person but that person disputes whether it is a larger participant. The Proposed Rule therefore sets forth a procedure for such a person to challenge its status as a larger participant by providing to the Assistant Director for Nonbank Supervision of the Bureau an affidavit setting forth an explanation of the basis for the person's assertion that it does not meet the definition of larger participant. The Proposed Rule further permitted a person to include with the response copies of any records, documents, or other information on which the person relied to make the assertion. The Proposed Rule also provided that a person waives the right to rely, in disputing whether it qualifies as a larger participant, on any argument, records, documents, or other information that it failed to submit to the Assistant Director under this section. Moreover, the Proposed Rule stated that a person that fails to respond to the Bureau's written communication within 30 days would be deemed to have acknowledged that it is a larger participant. Under the Proposed Rule, after reviewing the affidavit and any other information submitted by the person challenging its status as a larger participant or deemed relevant by the Assistant Director, the Assistant Director would send the person an electronic transmission explaining whether the person meets the definition of a larger participant. Additionally, the Proposed Rule stated that the Assistant Director may require that a person provide to the Bureau such records, documents, and information as the Assistant Director may deem appropriate for assisting assessments of entities' status as larger participants.",
                "These provisions were proposed pursuant to the Bureau's authority under 12 U.S.C. 5514(b)(7). Subparagraph (7)(A) authorizes the Bureau to \u201cprescribe rules to facilitate [its] supervision\u201d of, among other things, larger participants of the markets to be covered by regulations like the Proposed Rule. The ability to acquire information to support an assessment of whether a person meets the test for being a larger participant will serve that purpose.In addition, subparagraph (7)(B) authorizes the Bureau to require persons described in 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) to provide records to facilitate the Bureau's supervision. Section 1090.103 of the final rule was also proposed pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5512(b)(1), which grants the Director of the Bureau the authority to prescribe such rules as may be necessary and appropriate to enable the Bureau to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial law, such as the Bureau's supervision of larger participants, and to prevent evasions of such law. Providing a process whereby entities must come forward with information if they wish to challenge their status as larger participants, and providing the Bureau the ability to obtain information related to the status of persons as larger participants under the rule, is necessary and appropriate for the Bureau to implement and efficiently exercise its supervision authority and to prevent evasion of 12 U.S.C. 5514.",
                "The Bureau received a number of comments on the proposed process for allowing a person to submit to the Bureau documents and information supporting the person's assertion that it is not a larger participant. A representative of the consumer reporting industry suggested that the Bureau create a mechanism and procedures for appeal. Another commenter stated that the proposed method of challenging larger-participant status violates due process.",
                "The Bureau believes that the proposed procedure is an appropriate method by which a person may provide documents, records or other information to the Bureau if it wishes to dispute whether it meets the larger-participant threshold for a market. Due process concerns, as put forward by commenters, do not mandate any particular procedures for the initiation of supervision,because a decision to initiate supervision does not implicate an interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. Supervision alone does not impose any penalty on an entity, does not deprive it of any property, and does not restrict its ability to engage in a viable business. Moreover, even if a protected interest were at stake, the rule provides procedures that are comparable to those offered in numerous other situations that implicate protected interests.The Bureau will provide notice of its intent to supervise an entity; receive written submissions, accompanied by evidence; and entertain entities' arguments that they do not qualify as larger participants. Due process does not necessitate a hearing in every instance, and the evidence involved in assessing a larger participant's annual receipts from consumer reporting is not of the kind that requires oral presentation.The Bureau proposed to respond to entities' challenges to larger-participant status because the Bureau believed it would be useful to have an informal method for resolving whether a person is a larger participant. For all the above reasons, the Bureau does not believe additional procedures are necessary to comport with due process.",
                "Other commenters suggested that the 30-day time period allowed to challenge larger-participant status and provide the documents relied on for the challenge was not sufficient. One commenter representing the consumer financial services industry stated that nonbanks identified as larger participants should be able to provide additional arguments, records, documents, or other information to the Assistant Director as needed, particularly since the initial 30-day period is a narrow window and there is no deadline for a decision by the Assistant Director. Another industry representative said that it believes that 30 days is a wholly inadequate time period for a business to identify all of the relevant information and to prepare its argument, especially because of the difficulty of apportioning receipts. Similarly, a commenter representing the consumer reporting industry suggested eliminating or significantly revising the provision whereby a person that fails to respond to the Bureau within 30 days will be deemed to acknowledge that it is a larger participant. This commenter also stated that an entity should be able to challenge its status as a larger participant at any time if it has a good-faith basis for doing so, and failure to respond in any manner to a notice from the Bureau should not constitute waiver of the opportunity to submit evidence.Various industry commenters suggested that the final rule allow greater response times to challenge larger-participant assessments that ranged from 60 to 90 days, to an unlimited period.",
                "The Bureau, however, believes that it is necessary to have a firm time limit for this dispute process. Eliminating the deadlines and permitting additional records, documents, or other information to be presented to the Bureau at any time would create unnecessary uncertainty and be administratively difficult to implement. A firm deadline for submission of records, documents, or other information, on the other hand, would permit the timely and orderly resolution of an assessment of larger-participant status. Holding firms to have waived the opportunity to offer information and arguments that they do not present during the specified timeframe is an appropriate mechanism for enforcing the deadline.",
                "At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that entities may need time to collect and assemble relevant documentation regarding larger-participant status. The Proposed Rule included a provision under which the Assistant Director might modify the response time on her or his own initiative or at the request, based on a showing of good cause, of the person responding. The Bureau adopts in the final rule this provision for requesting an extension. In addition, the Bureau concludes that increasing the general time limit for response from the proposed 30 days to 45 days strikes an appropriate balance between providing a reasonable opportunity to challenge larger-participant status and not allowing so much time as to be disruptive to the supervisory program.",
                "A representative of the consumer reporting industry suggested that the final rule should require that the Bureau have a reasonable basis to believe that a person is a larger participant before sending a written communication initiating supervisory activity. As the Bureau has explained above, the Bureau expects to use various data sources, including publicly available data, to identify which nonbank covered persons appear to qualify as larger participants. The Bureau intends to use the best available data to make assessments regarding a person's status as a larger participant. If needed, the Bureau will request relevant information to help assess whether a person is a larger participant. Thus, the Bureau will make an informed assessment of larger-participant status. The Bureau believes neither that the Dodd-Frank Act requires, nor that it would be appropriate or necessary, for the Bureau to set forth in the regulation a specific standard regarding larger-participant status that must be met before the Bureau can undertake supervisory activity. The Bureau therefore declines to amend the Proposal in the manner suggested by this commenter.",
                "An industry commenter suggested that the dispute process could be an inefficient and costly exercise if there is no intent to supervise a person. The Bureau notes, however, that the response process only comes into play if the Bureau informs a person that it intends to undertake a supervisory activity in connection with that person, and if that person decides to dispute whether it is a larger participant.",
                "The Bureau also received a comment suggesting that the final rule provide a way for a person to request and obtain from the Bureau an advance larger-participant determination. The Bureau believes that providing an assessment as to whether a person qualifies as a larger participant, absent any intent of the Bureau to initiate supervisory activities in connection with the person, would be unnecessary and burdensome to the Bureau. A market participant should be capable of evaluating whether its activities qualify it as a larger participant. Additionally, such a process would be burdensome to the Bureau because, in addition to making such assessments with respect to market participants it considered examining, the Bureau could also be placed in the position of responding to myriad requests from market participants it does not have near-term plans to supervise. For these reasons the Bureau declines to amend the Proposed Rule to provide for advance determinations as described.",
                "Finally, the Bureau received comments from attorney and industry representatives expressing concern that nonbank covered persons will be obligated to provide attorney-client privileged information when challenging larger-participant status, or when the Bureau requires a person to provide information to support the Bureau's evaluation of entities' larger-participant status. But the Proposal did not require that any covered person provide privileged documents to the Bureau to support a challenge of larger-participant status. Of course, a person may choose to submit privileged documents in the course of such a challenge, although it is difficult to conceive of a need to submit privileged information to document an entity's representations as to its annual receipts. Pursuant to a rule recently adopted by the Bureau, such a submission would not result in a waiver of any applicable privilege as to third parties.Similarly, while under \u00a7\u20091090.103(d) the Bureau may require the submission of documents, the Bureau does not presently anticipate that, absent unusual circumstances, it would request attorney-client privileged material under this provision. In any event, the Bureau's recently adopted rule regarding submissions of privileged information would apply to material provided in response to such a request.",
                "For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau adopts \u00a7\u20091090.103, as proposed in \u00a7\u20091090.104 of the Proposed Rule, amended to increase the response period for disputing larger-participant status from 30 days to 45 days with additional minor technical amendments for consistency."

If a term is defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, the final rule generally incorporates that definition, with clarifications and modifications as appropriate. The Bureau received comments on a number of definitions set forth in the Proposed Rule and discusses the comments below in the context of the definition to which they relate.",
                "Affiliated company. To compute activity levels for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and its implementing rules, 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(3)(B) provides that the activities of affiliated companies (other than insured depository institutions or insured credit unions) shall be aggregated. The term \u201caffiliated company\u201d is not defined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Proposed Rule defined the term \u201caffiliated company\u201d in a manner guided by the definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act,with modifications to track the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(3)(B). Thus, the Proposed Rule stated that the term \u201caffiliated company\u201d of a person means any company (other than an insured depository institution or insured credit union) that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the person.",
                "For purposes of the definition of \u201caffiliated company,\u201d the Proposed Rule provided that the term \u201ccompany\u201d means any corporation, limited liability company, business trust, general or limited partnership, proprietorship, cooperative, association, or similar organization. The Bureau received one comment suggesting that this definition be revised to include professional corporations and professional limited liability companies. The Bureau believes that the proposed definition, which encompasses \u201csimilar organization[s]\u201d to those expressly enumerated, is sufficiently broad to cover professional corporations and professional limited liability companies, as well as other forms of organization comparable to those on the enumerated list that exist or may arise. Thus, the Bureau deems the suggested amendment unnecessary.",

                "The Bureau received a number of comments from consumer groups requesting that the Bureau include in the final rule provisions to prevent market participants from structuring business forms and activities to evade coverage as larger participants. For example, one commenter suggested that the Bureau should prevent evasion by aggregating not only the revenues of \u201caffiliated companies,\u201d but also those of \u201cjoint enterprises,\u201d defined as two or more companies that act with a common purpose, in coordination, or through a contractual relationship to provide consumer financial products or services. Similarly, many consumer groups suggested aggregating the receipts of a firm's agents and contractors.",
                "The Bureau understands commenters' concern regarding possible evasion of the final rule that could potentially occur by a market participant's structuring business activities through separate entities. For example, a covered person might attempt evasion by dividing its consumer reporting tasks among several unaffiliated companies, each having less than $7 million in annual receipts, to avoid Bureau supervision. However, control or common control is a prerequisite for being an \u201caffiliate\u201d under the Dodd-Frank Act; and the Bureau likewise proposed to make control or common control a prerequisite for being an \u201caffiliated company.\u201d\u2009The Bureau further believes that the test for control in the Proposal, which considered, among other things, whether one person directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of another, provides an adequate tool to address the type of structuring to evade supervision coverage that the commenters describe. The Bureau therefore declines to amend the Proposal to require aggregation of the annual receipts of \u201cjoint enterprises\u201d or of companies that have only a cooperative or contractual relationship but otherwise do not satisfy a test for control in the final rule.",
                "A few industry commenters objected more generally to one concept of control recognized in the proposed definition, in which one person directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of another. These commenters stated that a potential larger participant would not know in advance which companies it is deemed to exercise a controlling influence over, and therefore how to calculate its aggregated annual receipts. Normally, the Bureau believes, a market participant could use reasonable judgment to determine whether it has an affiliated company whose annual receipts would be aggregated with its own. In addition, under the final rule, prior to undertaking supervisory activity in connection with a market participant, the Bureau would notify the participant of its intent; the market participant would then have the opportunity, pursuant to \u00a7\u20091090.103 of the final rule, to challenge its status as a larger participant, including on the ground that its annual receipts should not be aggregated with those of certain other companies. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that, in the context of the procedures set forth in the final rule, the proposed definition of \u201ccontrol\u201d provides market participants sufficient advance guidance regarding their status as larger participants and does not believe it is necessary to amend the proposed test for control to address these commenters' concerns. Moreover, as indicated above, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to have a definition of \u201ccontrol\u201d that is sufficiently flexible to prevent evasion of the rule.",
                "One commenter also expressed concern that if a large company handles a small firm's day-to-day operations, as a service, the larger firm would be considered to exercise a controlling influence. Therefore, according to this commenter, the \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d test for control could distort the market for such services. It could also, this commenter said, unfairly sweep a small firm into the category of larger participants, based solely on the small firm's use of a larger participant for such operational services. As defined in the Proposed Rule, mere execution of certain of another company's activities would not constitute \u201ccontrol\u201d over that company. Rather, under the proposed definition of the term, to constitute control, one person must directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of another person. The Bureau notes that under the Proposal, the Bureau would evaluate for each company it reviews whether one person has a controlling interest over another, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the relationship.If one company does in fact have a controlling influence over another's management or policies, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to aggregate the annual receipts of the companies for purposes of assessing larger-participant status, and that this would not be unfair to a smaller company that is controlled by a larger one. Therefore the Bureau declines to amend the Proposal to delete the \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d test.",
                "Commenters also argued that before determining that one person exercises a controlling influence over another, the Bureau should provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The Bureau recognizes that some other Federal statutes, such as the BHCA, provide for hearings in assessing whether one company has a controlling influence over another.At the same time, a number of other Federal statutes and regulations that contain \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d provisions do not contain hearing provisions.The Bureau believes that the need for a hearing, as under the BHCA, is not present here. Under the BHCA, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must approve the establishment of a bank holding company.A person that controls a bank holding company is itself a bank holding company under the BHCA.The activities of a bank holding company are highly regulated by the Board of Governors.Thus, a finding of control under the BHCA has a much more significant consequence than a finding of control would have under the final rule. In the case of the final rule, the consequence of companies' being affiliated by means of a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d is that their annual receipts would be aggregated for purposes of assessing whether they are larger participants of a covered market, and thus subject to supervision by the Bureau's supervisory authority.The companies would not be subject to any new substantive conduct requirements as a result. As discussed below, being subject to supervision is not a consequence that necessitates a hearing, as a matter of due process, on the general question whether a company is a larger participant. A hearing is similarly not necessary on the predicate issue of whether two companies are affiliated. Therefore, the Bureau believes that a hearing provision is not warranted for the final rule and declines to add such a provision.",
                "Several industry commenters argued that owning voting securities or similar interests should not constitute control until a person owns 50 percent, rather than 25 percent, of any class of voting securities or similar interest. One pointed out that if the threshold is only 25 percent, a given entity could be an \u201caffiliated company\u201d of several persons, if each such person owned just over 25 percent of a class of voting securities. The Bureau notes the 25 percent threshold test is used in a number of statutes and regulations to determine whether one person controls another in the context of financial institutions.The Bureau believes that this widely used threshold is appropriate for the final rule. The Bureau is concerned that increasing the ownership threshold from 25 percent to 50 percent would mean that if one person owns 49 percent of a company, and three others separately owned the remaining 51 percent of that company, no person would be deemed to control that company, absent the presence of a \u201ccontrolling influence.\u201d The Bureau believes that raising the ownership threshold as requested would too easily permit evasion of, or attempts to evade, the aggregation requirement. The Bureau therefore declines to increase the ownership threshold to 50 percent.",
                "Finally, one commenter argued that when a company acquires another firm, the acquiring company cannot immediately exercise control over the target's operations. This commenter requested a grace period of 12 months after the acquisition, during which the target firm would not be considered an \u201caffiliated company\u201d for purposes of this rule. The Bureau believes that when one company acquires another, the acquiring company in fact controls the acquired company at the time of the transaction. This is true even if the acquiring company chooses to exercise that control by maintaining the status quo. The Bureau also notes that \u201ccontrol\u201d is a concept used only to implement the aggregation requirement under 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(3)(B) in connection with assessing whether a person is a larger participant of a market for consumer financial products or services. Even assuming the acquirer lacks effective control over the acquired company immediately after the acquisition, the annual receipts of the combined company are nonetheless an appropriate measure of the resulting company's market participation. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to amend the Proposed Rule to provide a 12-month grace period as requested.",
                "For all of the foregoing reasons, the Bureau adopts the definition of \u201caffiliated company\u201d with minor technical amendments for consistency.",

However, the Bureau believes that a calendar year, a 12-month period ending on December 31, could be an appropriate tax year for purposes of this Part.

                "The Bureau did, however, receive several comments related to the scope and exercise of the Bureau's supervisory authority. One group representing industry participants requested further detail about what an examination or supervision report would entail. Supervision may involve requests for information or records, on-site or off-site examinations, or some combination of these activities. While the specifics of an examination may vary by market and by firm, the following applies generally to the supervision process. Typically, Bureau officials begin an on-site examination by contacting the firm for an initial conference with management, and often by also requesting records and information. Based on these discussions and an initial review of the information received, examiners will determine the scope of an on-site examination, and then coordinate with the firm to initiate the on-site portion of the examination. While on-site, examiners will spend a period of time holding discussions with management about the company's processes and procedures; reviewing documents, records, and accounts for compliance; and evaluating the firm's compliance management systems. As with the Bureau's bank examinations, examinations of nonbanks will involve issuing confidential examination reports and compliance ratings.",
                "The Bureau additionally notes that it has published a general examination manual describing the Bureau's supervisory approach and processes, as well as substantive legal areas subject to examination. This manual is available on the Bureau's Web site.As explained in the examination manual, reports of examination will be structured to address various factors related to a supervised entity's compliance with Federal consumer financial law and other relevant considerations. The Bureau intends to release examination procedures specific to consumer reporting prior to beginning examinations.",
                "One consumer group commented that where the Bureau has supervisory authority over a larger participant by virtue of its participation in a particular market, the Bureau should examine all of the entity's activities related to consumer financial products or services, even those that pertain to markets in which the entity is not a larger participant. A commenter from the consumer reporting industry, on the other hand, asked the Bureau to make clear that it will exclude from its examination of a larger participant of a market areas of the company's operations outside that particular market.",
                "The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Bureau to supervise \u201ccovered person[s]\u201d described in 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)(A) through (E). By granting the Bureau supervisory authority over such \u201ccovered persons,\u201d as opposed to over particular activities in which they engage, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes that the Bureau's supervisory authority is not limited to the products or services that qualified a person for supervision, but also includes other activities of such a person that involve other consumer financial products or services or are subject to Federal consumer financial law.This broad supervisory scope is consistent with the purposes that the Dodd-Frank Act sets out for the Bureau's supervisory activities. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Bureau to require reports and conduct examinations on a periodic basis of the \u201cpersons\u201d described in 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) for purposes of (a) assessing compliance with the requirements of Federal consumer financial law, (b) obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such persons, and (c) detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services.In many cases, these broad purposes could not be accomplished if the scope of the Bureau's examinations and report requests were limited to the particular products or services that qualified a person for the Bureau's supervision. For example, an entity's violation of a provision of the FCRA in connection with activities that fall outside the final rule's definition of consumer reporting would still be relevant to whether the entity has violated a Federal consumer financial law and to whether the entity may pose risks to consumers. Moreover, such a violation of the FCRA may indicate weaknesses in compliance systems and the potential for other violations and related consumer harms.",
                "Accordingly, the Bureau concludes that if an entity is subject to the Bureau's supervisory authority, the Bureau may examine the entire entity for compliance with all Federal consumer financial law, assess enterprise-wide compliance systems and procedures, and assess and detect risks to consumers or to markets for consumer financial products and services posed by any activity of the entity, not just the activities that initially rendered the entity subject to Bureau supervision.",
                "A commenter representing the consumer reporting industry urged the Bureau to publish examination manuals and procedures sufficiently far in advance of any examination or other supervision activity so that affected companies could incorporate such manuals and procedures into their procedures and training. As noted above, the Bureau has published its general examination manual as well as examination procedures for mortgage origination and servicing, and for short-term, small-dollar loans. The examination manual outlines legal requirements under the various laws applicable to the relevant products and services and guides examiners on information they should evaluate regarding compliance with those laws. Many of the laws addressed in the examination manual, including but not limited to the FCRA, are directly applicable to consumer reporting entities, and the Bureau intends to supplement the manual to include procedures specifically addressed to consumer reporting before beginning examinations. As noted in the discussion on the effective date above (Section IV(B)), however, market participants are required to be in compliance with applicable Federal consumer financial law, regardless of whether they are subject to supervision by the Bureau.",
                "The Bureau received several comments regarding the supervision of service providers to larger participants. Neither the Proposed Rule nor the final rule addresses the scope or manner of the Bureau's supervisory authority over service providers to nonbanks pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5514. The Proposal simply observed that the Dodd-Frank Act vests the Bureau with supervisory authority over service providers.Consequently, comments regarding which service providers the Bureau may supervise, and how, are not germane to the final rule."

                "Annual receipts. The proposed definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d was informed by the method of calculating \u201cannual receipts\u201d used by the SBA in determining whether a firm is a \u201csmall business\u201d concern.Under the proposed definition, for purposes of calculating \u201cannual receipts,\u201d the term \u201creceipts\u201d means \u201ctotal income\u201d (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, \u201cgross income\u201d) plus \u201ccost of goods sold\u201d as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return forms. Under the Proposal, the term would not include net capital gains or losses. As proposed, annual receipts are measured as the average of a person's three most recently completed fiscal years, as appropriate, or over the entire period the person has been in business if that is less than three completed fiscal years.The proposed calculation of annual receipts would also implement the aggregation requirement in 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(3)(B) by providing that the annual receipts of a person shall be added to the annual receipts of each of its affiliated companies. As proposed, such aggregation includes the receipts of both the acquired and acquiring companies in the case of an acquisition occurring during any relevant measurement period.",
                "The Bureau received a number of comments relating to \u201cannual receipts.\u201d\u2009Many commenters expressed concerns or raised objections to the use of annual receipts to measure participation in the consumer reporting market. One commenter asked whether the Bureau intends to bind itself to IRS guidance and related tax law and recommended that the Bureau provide examples of how different industry participants should calculate annual receipts under the final rule. The Bureau notes that to the extent IRS tax forms are utilized by a nonbank covered person to calculate receipts, which consist of \u201ctotal income\u201d (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, \u201cgross income\u201d) plus \u201ccost of goods sold,\u201d the person should rely on IRS guidance. Additionally, the Bureau believes that there may be a variety of circumstances facing covered persons and the Bureau is not in a position to ascertain the most appropriate or useful examples to include in the final rule. Therefore, the Bureau declines to provide examples of how market participants should calculate annual receipts.",
                "Several industry commenters argued that the definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d counts part of a company's revenue twice, by including both total sales and cost of goods sold. These commenters suggested raising the threshold for qualifying as a larger participant of the consumer reporting market from more than $7 million to $14 million in annual receipts. Properly understood, the measurement of \u201cannual receipts\u201d does not involve double counting. In calculating total income, cost of goods sold is subtracted from various sources of income.Thus, in calculating annual receipts, cost of goods sold is added back in to offset the original subtraction of the identical figure. The Bureau therefore declines to amend the definition of \u201cannual receipts\u201d based on this comment.",
                "The Bureau received several comments on the appropriate measurement period for assessing larger-participant status (and thus when the supervision period begins). One consumer group suggested that to capture participants whose annual receipts are increasing, a person should be deemed a larger participant if the person had annual receipts meeting the applicable threshold either as an average of annual receipts over the last three fiscal years, or in the most recent fiscal year. Conversely, some commenters, believing the Proposal already specified that larger-participant status would be triggered by a single year's results, argued that businesses would forego growing in order to avoid accidentally coming within the Bureau's supervisory authority. One commenter suggested that an entity should qualify as a larger participant only if its receipts were above the threshold for three years in a row.",
                "To clarify, under the rule \u201cannual receipts\u201d generally are not based solely on the receipts of a single year.The Bureau agrees with those commenters who suggested that temporary fluctuations generally should not render an entity a larger participant. The proposed definition, by averaging a company's receipts over a three-year period, reduces the impact of sudden and potentially temporary fluctuations in receipts a company may experience\u2014both decreases and increases. Thus the Bureau declines to include generally as larger participants persons who have receipts above the threshold in only the most recent fiscal year. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau adopts the definition of annual receipts as proposed, with minor technical amendments, including a relocation of the definition into the section for consumer reporting market-specific definitions (Subpart B, \u00a7\u20091090.104(a)).",

The Bureau stated that the proposed definition would cover different types of consumer reporting entities such as credit bureaus, consumer report resellers, analyzers, and specialty consumer reporting agencies like those specializing in consumer check verification and reporting of payday lending transactions.The proposed definition also excluded several activities from the consumer reporting market. First, a person's providing information on its own transactions or experiences with consumers to its affiliates would not constitute consumer reporting. Second, a person's providing information on its own (or its affiliates') transactions or experiences to a consumer reporting entity would also be excluded. Third, the proposed definition incorporated the exclusion detailed in 12 U.S.C. 5481(15)(A)(ix) for information used solely in a decision regarding employment, government licensing, or residential leasing.",
                "The final rule adopts the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d with several modifications. The final rule prescribes a broader exclusion for providing a company's information on its own transactions and experiences with consumers; the Bureau will not treat a company's provision of such information to any other person to be \u201cconsumer reporting.\u201d The final rule also adds an exclusion for information that amounts to an authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit, directly or indirectly, by the issuer of a credit card or similar device.",
                "The Bureau received many comments on the definition of the term \u201cconsumer reporting.\u201d One category of comments focused on the relationship between the consumer reporting activities covered by the Proposed Rule and those subject to the FCRA. First, a number of commenters criticized the definition for departing from the definitions of \u201cconsumer report\u201d and \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d in the FCRA.Several of these commenters suggested that the difference between the Proposed Rule and the FCRA would cause uncertainty and confusion. They argued that some persons that do not consider themselves to be in the consumer reporting market would, unknowingly, nevertheless be subject to Bureau supervision. Other persons, the commenters contended, would erroneously believe they were subject to supervision and would waste effort preparing for examinations.",
                "The Bureau did not intend the Proposal's definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d to mirror the scope of the FCRA's definitions of \u201cconsumer report\u201d and \u201cconsumer reporting agency.\u201d\u2009In some respects the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d was narrower than these FCRA definitions because it excluded information to be used solely in a decision for employment, government licensing, or residential leasing or tenancy. In other respects the proposed definition may have been somewhat broader than the coverage of the FCRA. For example, \u201cconsumer report information, or other account information,\u201d for purposes of the Proposed Rule, could include information beyond what would be considered a \u201cconsumer report\u201d under the FCRA. Similarly, certain entities that are not \u201cconsumer reporting agencies\u201d within the meaning of the FCRA\u2014such as certain analyzers of consumer report information\u2014may be larger participants of the consumer reporting market delineated by the final rule. The Bureau's rule and the FCRA serve two different purposes. The FCRA is a substantive consumer protection statute that governs the activities of consumer reporting agencies (and other persons that furnish information to or receive information from such agencies). The rule, by contrast, defines larger participants of a market for consumer reporting for purposes of initially delineating the scope of coverage of the Bureau's supervision authority.",
                "The Bureau's supervisory activities will extend beyond assessing consumer reporting agencies' compliance with the FCRA. The Bureau will also assess compliance with other Federal consumer financial law, and compliance with such law by persons other than those that the FCRA defines as consumer reporting agencies. Moreover, the Bureau's supervisory activities will seek to obtain information regarding activities and compliance systems and procedures of supervised persons and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets for consumer financial products or services.The Bureau emphasizes that the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d is relevant only to the final rule and has no applicability to the scope, coverage, definitions, or any other provisions of the FCRA or any other law or regulation. Therefore, the Bureau declines to conform the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d to the FCRA's definitions of \u201cconsumer report\u201d and \u201cconsumer reporting agencies.\u201d",
                "Second, several commenters pointed to what they said was a particularly important departure from the FCRA. According to these commenters, the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d covered circumstances in which a person does not provide information to a third party, for the third party's use in connection with a decision regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service. As an initial matter, it should be noted in this context that the final rule excludes a person's provision for any purpose of information about its own transactions or experiences with consumers. Moreover, under the proposed definition, the consumer reporting market covered collecting, analyzing, maintaining, or providing consumer report or other account information for its use or expected use \u201cby another person\u201d in a decision regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service. Thus, the person using or expected to use the information must be different from the market participant collecting, analyzing, maintaining, or providing the information. It bears emphasizing, however, that the person using or expected to use the information in a decision regarding a consumer financial product or service need not be a market participant's immediate customer. For example, resellers generally assemble and merge information contained in the databases of other consumer reporting agencies, and then provide reports including that information to third parties such as creditors that use the information to make a credit decision. Providing consumer report information to a reseller is included in the market, even though the reseller itself may not make decisions regarding the offering or provision of consumer financial products or services.",
                "Third, commenters also suggested dividing the consumer reporting market identified by the Proposal into submarkets. One commenter suggested, for example, defining a separate market to cover consumer reporting entities over which the Bureau wishes to exercise supervisory authority but that are not consumer reporting agencies under the FCRA. Another proposed having two markets, demarcated by a distinction that, the commenter said, the FCRA makes between national credit repositories and consumer report resellers.",
                "The Bureau believes that resellers, national credit repositories, specialty consumer reporting agencies, analyzers, and others engaged in consumer reporting activities as defined in the final rule are properly included in a single market. These different types of firms all participate in the process of preparing consumer financial information for use in decisions regarding consumer financial products or services. Moreover, many of the same legal requirements cover repositories, resellers, and specialty consumer reporting agencies. To the extent that the activities of larger participants of the consumer reporting market differ, the Bureau can adjust the scope and focus of its supervision activities accordingly. Therefore, the Bureau declines to revise the definition of consumer reporting to establish separate markets for consumer report resellers, the national repositories, and others engaged in consumer reporting activities.",
                "Another category of comments asked the Bureau to alter the scope of the proposed exclusions from the consumer reporting market. First, the Bureau received comments both in favor of expanding the exclusion for furnishing information and in favor of deleting that exclusion.",
                "Commenters opposing the exclusion expressed the view that the Bureau must ensure that it supervises major furnishers of information to consumer reporting entities, in addition to such entities as depositories and payday lenders that are otherwise subject to the Bureau's supervisory authority. The Bureau believes that companies' supplying information to consumer reporting entities on their own, or their affiliate's, transactions or experiences with consumers was properly excluded from the Proposed Rule. Furnishing information of that type is typically incidental to the furnisher's primary business, and an enormously wide variety of businesses furnish such information to consumer reporting entities. Therefore, including such activity in the definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d could have the unintended consequence of delineating such a broad consumer reporting market that it would encompass, for example, many types of consumer creditors. Because furnishing a company's own transaction and experience data is fundamentally different from the activities defined by the rule as consumer reporting, the Bureau does not believe such furnishing should be included in the same market for purposes of implementing the nonbank supervision program for consumer reporting entities.",
                "Other commenters suggested broadening in various ways the exclusion for furnishing information. One commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that agents and contractors that transmit information about a company's transactions or experiences with consumers on that company's behalf do not thereby become participants of the consumer reporting market. It is the Bureau's view that such agents or contractors would not be participating in the consumer reporting market merely by providing technical or operational support services to facilitate a person's furnishing of its own transaction and experience information to a consumer reporting entity.",
                "Another commenter provided the example of a depository institution that provides information about a consumer's account balances to a mortgage lender deciding whether to extend a loan to the consumer. Because the Proposed Rule excluded only an entity's provision of its transaction or experience information to its affiliates or to consumer reporting entities, this commenter believed the provision of information in its hypothetical example would fall within the scope of consumer reporting activities. The Bureau agrees that an entity's providing its own transaction or experience information in this context should not be treated as a consumer reporting activity. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting, in the final rule, a simpler, broader exclusion. The final rule excludes a person's collecting, maintaining, analyzing, or providing its own transaction or experience information for use or expected use by another person in a decision regarding a consumer financial product or service. Such activity is excluded from the consumer reporting market defined by the rule, regardless of what person receives the information.",
                "A commenter also suggested excluding from the final rule providing information to process a transaction requested by a consumer, a possible activity of payment systems that process account transactions. The Bureau agrees that such payment system activities should be excluded from the final rule and amends the final rule by excluding any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device.",
                "Another commenter stated that companies that provide information outside the scope of the FCRA, but for use by third parties in decisions regarding the offering or provision of consumer financial products or services, do not operate in a market that could reasonably be considered a \u201cconsumer reporting market.\u201d This commenter specifically referenced what it described as Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)-covered products, including consumer identification authentication, or fraud detection and identity theft protection, over which the commenter asserted the Bureau has no jurisdiction, as a result of 12 U.S.C. 5481(15)(B)(i). However, the cited provision says expressly that it applies \u201c[f]or purposes of (A)(xi)(II),\u201d and it does not purport to affect whether an activity constitutes a consumer financial product or service under any provision other than (A)(xi). For this and other reasons, the provision in question is not pertinent to this rulemaking. The Bureau therefore declines to alter the definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d in the way this commenter suggested.",
                "Another commenter asserted that the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d included too broad a scope of \u201canalytical services.\u201d The commenter suggested either excluding all analytical services or, at a minimum, providing other more limited exclusions for certain types of such services. The commenter also argued that analytical services should be excluded because the activity has a low risk of harm to consumers.",
                "Analyzing consumer report information is an important activity in the consumer reporting market, and, as with collecting, maintaining, and providing information, can be an important factor in decisions regarding the offering or provision of consumer financial products or services. Additionally, the Bureau is aware of some entities that engage in reporting of consumer information and also analyze that information, deriving receipts from that analysis. Just as businesses extending credit rely on the collecting, maintaining, or providing of consumer report information, some also purchase analyses of the underlying consumer report information. Analyzing activity generally is done for compensation and may result in annual receipts for the entity providing analytical services, and a company that meets the threshold on the basis of its analyzing activities will likely affect many consumers. For these reasons, the Bureau declines to exclude analyzing consumer information in general from the consumer reporting market.",
                "The commenter also suggested that if analytical services are not generally excluded, the Bureau should exclude analytical services rendered for a particular consumer financial services provider using that provider's own information. The commenter argued that such services could be supervised in the context of examinations of the financial service provider itself, and that the Bureau's supervision program should not be duplicative by covering providers of such analytical services as \u201clarger participants.\u201d The commenter additionally suggested excluding analytical services other than certain modeling services,arguing that the Bureau should focus its resources elsewhere.",
                "The Bureau clarifies that the consumer reporting market delineated in the final rule does not include the activity of providing analytical services regarding another person's own information to that other person, where such analysis is used solely by that other person and is not provided to a third party (other than the other person's affiliated companies). Such activity is not treated differently, in the final rule, from a person's conducting its own analysis for its own use. A person's analyzing its own consumer report or other account information, without the expectation that the information will be used in connection with a decision \u201cby another person,\u201d is not included in the defined consumer reporting market. It is the Bureau's view that agents or contractors who analyze a person's data on that person's behalf, solely for that person's use, are similarly not analyzing consumer report or other account information for use \u201cby another person.\u201d",
                "The Bureau also received comments from consumer groups and consumers arguing that the market for consumer reporting should include background screening for employment purposes. The Bureau notes that the proposed definition of \u201cconsumer reporting\u201d excluded collecting, analyzing, maintaining, or providing consumer report or other information to the extent that the information is used solely in a decision regarding employment, government licensing, or residential leasing, because these are explicit exclusions under 12 U.S.C. 5481(15)(A)(ix). Accordingly, the Bureau declines to amend the Proposal to include the activity of employment background screening in the final rule's definition of \u201cconsumer reporting.\u201d\u2009",
                "For the reasons stated above, the Bureau adopts the Proposal's definition of \u201cconsumer reporting,\u201d amended as described above and with minor technical amendments for consistency."

The extent to which specific activities within that market may pose greater or lower risks to consumers does not determine whether to include the activities within the market; risk posed by a particular larger participant within the market for consumer reporting will be considered pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5514(b)(2), in the course of the Bureau's exercise of its supervisory authority.",

The commenter recommended that the final rule state expressly that a market participant may make a good faith determination of its annual receipts based on records maintained in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau does not believe such an addition to the regulation is necessary, because the rule does not restrict companies to relying solely on their IRS forms. The criterion by which market participation is measured is annual receipts resulting from consumer reporting; the Bureau is aware that this specific quantity does not necessarily correspond, for every company, to a figure reported to the IRS.

Given the focus of these provisions of the Proposal on obtaining particularized information relevant to larger-participant status, the Bureau does not believe that such consultation is necessary or appropriate in connection with this final rule. The Bureau, however, requested comments from relevant State agencies on the Proposal, and did receive comments from a couple of State regulatory agencies expressing their belief that a certain company providing information services relating to payday lending should be excluded from the rule's coverage.",

Several consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should explicitly state in the text of the regulation that credit scoring providers or developers are service providers. Assessing whether a particular entity is a service provider to a larger participant under the Dodd-Frank Act requires an evaluation of the person's activities. The Bureau declines to identify specific activities that might make a person a service provider to a larger participant, or to provide an exhaustive list of such activities.",

This calculation assumes that the 14 firms in the Census-defined tier between $5 million and $10 million are evenly distributed throughout the tier. Because of uncertainty over the distribution within this tier, the Bureau acknowledges that its estimate of 30 consumer reporting agencies is only approximate, and that between 21 and 35 consumer reporting agencies may meet the threshold based on Census data. The Bureau based the 94 percent calculation on the amount of annual receipts generated by the 30 largest consumer reporting agencies. The 20 largest consumer reporting agencies generate 92 percent of annual receipts in the industry. The Bureau estimates that the next 10 largest firms generate about 2 percent of annual receipts in the industry, for a total of 94 percent.",
        "73":"As noted above, the Bureau now has access to more detailed data relating solely to consumer reporting entities than it did when it published the Proposal. The more detailed supplemental data confirm the Bureau's original estimates; the Bureau relies on these data for the sake of improved accuracy. The Census data indicate there are 410 consumer reporting businesses in NAICS code 5614501. This figure is quite close to the number (401) estimated in the Proposal based on data for NAICS code 561450. The Bureau still regards 410 as only an estimate for the number of firms in the consumer reporting market, because, as discussed above, some firms may not report their activities properly and some firms (such as certain analyzers) may not fall within this NAICS code.",
        "72":"In the Proposal, the Bureau made estimates based on data available from the 2007 Economic Census for NAICS code 561450. Since issuing the Proposal, the Bureau has learned of additional detailed Economic Census data for NAICS code 5614501, which encompasses \u201cconsumer credit reporting agencies\u201d but not \u201cmercantile reporting agencies,\u201d in contrast to code 561450. These additional data have permitted the Bureau to refine its original estimates. First, the Bureau originally concluded that the consumer reporting market includes about 401 entities. This estimate was based on summary data for NAICS code 561450. The more detailed data permit the Bureau to refine its estimate to 410 consumer reporting entities. Second, the summary data for NAICS code 561450 informed the Bureau that about 75 percent of establishments in the code, over all sizes of firms, were consumer reporting entities. The more detailed data for NAICS code 5614501 reveal that the 75 percent figure is fairly consistent throughout the distribution of firm sizes. Third, the more detailed data for NAICS code 5614501 permit a closer estimate of the number of firms with receipts between the threshold and $10 million. This estimate does not change the Bureau's basic conclusions about how many firms are larger participants given the $7 million threshold; what fraction of the market they constitute; and what proportion of total receipts in the market they represent. The discussion of the threshold, below, will be based on the more refined data from NAICS code 5614501. The Bureau also received one comment suggesting that the Bureau use the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System as a data source. However this source does not yet include data on the consumer reporting market. Another commenter suggested using a database maintained by the Federal National Mortgage Association. But that database only includes the names of a small set of reporting entities, and does not provide any other data.",

During the 2014 tax year, beginning on July 1, 2013, the three most recently completed fiscal years would be 2011, 2012, and 2013, with an average of $8 million in receipts. The entity would therefore be a larger participant during its 2014 tax year. Because that status lasts for two years, the entity would also be a larger participant during its 2015 tax year (from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015), even if its 2014 \u201cannual receipts\u201d were below $7 million. For example, suppose the entity had only $2 million in receipts for the completed 2014 fiscal year. The decreased receipts would first factor into the \u201cannual receipts\u201d calculation for 2015, when they would reduce the company's \u201cannual receipts\u201d to $6 million.
