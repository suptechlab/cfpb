    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, and the official interpretation to that regulation, to temporarily suspend card issuers' obligations to submit credit card agreements to the Bureau for a period of one year (i.e., four quarterly submissions), in order to reduce burden while the Bureau works to develop a more streamlined and automated electronic submission system. Other requirements, including card issuers' obligations to post currently- offered agreements on their own Web sites, remain unaffected.",

Specifically, \u00a7 1026.58(c) governs submission of agreements to the Bureau, \u00a7 1026.58(d) governs the requirement that issuers post currently-offered agreements on the issuers' own Web sites, and \u00a7 1026.58(e) governs the requirement that issuers make cardholder agreements for currently open accounts available to cardholders.",

The Bureau proposed, in \u00a7 1026.58(g)(1), to temporarily suspend the quarterly credit card agreement submission requirement in \u00a7 1026.58(c) for submissions that would otherwise be due to the Bureau by the first business day on or after April 30, 2015; July 31, 2015; October 31, 2015; and January 31, 2016.

The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.58(g)(2) to provide that the suspended submission requirement in proposed \u00a7 1026.58(g)(1) would not affect card issuers' obligations to post agreements on their own Web sites as required by \u00a7 1026.58(d) during the temporary suspension period. The Bureau proposed comment 58(g)-3 to further explain this provision and provide several examples."

                "The Bureau solicited comment on its proposal to temporarily suspend the obligation card issuers would otherwise have had under \u00a7 1026.58(c) to submit credit card agreements to the Bureau for the four quarterly submissions that would otherwise be due to the Bureau by the first business day on or after April 30, 2015; July 31, 2015; October 31, 2015; and January 31, 2016. Commenters generally supported the proposed rule, and no commenter opposed the proposed temporary suspension. All of the trade association commenters stated that they found the current manual submission system for credit card agreements to be cumbersome. Those same commenters, along with others, agreed that issuers' continuing obligation to post currently-offered credit card agreements on their Web sites would ensure that most interested consumers could access available credit card agreements.", 
                "Trade association commenters urged that the Bureau should consult with financial institutions before finalizing new technical specifications for the submission of credit card agreements, including one commenter who supported releasing those specifications through the notice-and-comment process. The Bureau did not solicit comment regarding the technical specifications that will be associated with a new submission system; nonetheless, the Bureau expects to consult with financial institutions, trade associations, or both to test and refine the system before using it with industry generally. The Bureau does not anticipate soliciting comment regarding the technical specifications that will be associated with a new submission system.", 
                "A commenter from an academic public policy center suggested that, rather than temporarily suspending the submission requirement for a period of one year, the Bureau should remove the submission requirement entirely.\n          \n        ", 
                "One commenter addressed an option that the Bureau considered but ultimately did not propose, under which credit card issuers would be required, at the end of the one-year suspension period, to submit all agreements that they would have been required to submit during the suspension period. That commenter argued that the burden imposed by such a requirement would not be justified by the limited benefit resulting from a more complete database of agreements."

As noted above, none of the comments received opposed the one-year temporary suspension, and most supported the Bureau's efforts to develop a more streamlined and efficient electronic submission system for credit card agreements. None of the comments discussed the specific language of the proposed regulatory text or commentary. After reviewing the comments received in response to the proposal, the Bureau believes that a one-year suspension represents the best balance between fulfilling the Congressional mandate in TILA section 122(d) and easing the compliance burden on credit card issuers arising from the manual submission system inherited by the Bureau while the Bureau works to develop a more streamlined and automated electronic submission system."
