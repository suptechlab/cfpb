    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation B, which implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and the Bureau's official interpretations of the regulation, which interpret and clarify the requirements of Regulation B. The final rule revises Regulation B to implement an ECOA amendment concerning appraisals and other valuations that was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act). In general, the revisions to Regulation B require creditors to provide to applicants free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, and require creditors to notify applicants in writing that copies of appraisals will be provided to them promptly.",

In the proposal, the Bureau assumed that 84 percent of appraisals are sent via email and that these are already being sent in a manner that complies with the E-Sign Act, 15.75 percent of appraisals are sent via the United States Postal Service, and 0.25 percent of appraisals are sent via courier. The final rule adopts this assumption, recognizing that some creditors, as reflected in comments received on the proposal, may elect not to provide copies electronically in compliance with the E-Sign Act (and therefore these copies would be provided as part of the 16 percent of copies that are sent via the postal service or courier). Because the Bureau does not have data, for purposes of this analysis, the Bureau conservatively assumes that the average non-appraisal valuation is as long as an appraisal (20 pages), that printing costs for valuations other than appraisals are the same as for appraisals, that currently, no written valuations other than appraisals are sent to applicants, and that the cost of sending copies of these valuations would be the same as an appraisal. Mailing an appraisal is assumed to cost $2.12 based on the cost of first class mail for a 3.7oz letter (20 pages of 20 lb paper weighs 3.2oz with a 0.5oz allowance for an envelope) and requires 5 minutes of loan officer time (a conservative assumption, because it is based on loan officer time rather than the time of a loan processor); sending an appraisal via a courier is assumed to cost $17 ($15 for courier fees and $2 for replication costs) in material costs and 5 minutes of loan officer time; and, sending a copy via email is assumed to cost $0.05 of material cost and 1 minute of loan officer time.",

Similarly, for HELOC first lien loan counts, the Experian-Oliver Wyman data cannot be split by size of depository institution, so a parallel convention of attributing all depository institution costs to each class of depository institutions is followed. The number of first lien HELOCs is calculated by multiplying the number of HELOCs for depository institutions (242,710) and non-depository institutions (76,790) by the proportion of HELOCs that are first liens in the 2010 SCF (0.26).",

Smaller institutions may not have a compliance officer, in which case additional implementation time would be assumed by the lawyer or other employee. Finally, the Bureau also believes that as part of routine software updates, creditors may make adjustments to software systems to ensure compliance with this rule (including updating the standard notice and incorporating additional valuation types into their copy distribution system); the Bureau does not believe these adjustments would impose significant additional costs beyond the existing routine upgrade processes.",

Moreover, the commenters do not suggest a reliable method for assessing cumulative impacts of multiple rulemakings. The Bureau believes that there are multiple reasonable approaches for conducting the consideration called for by section 1022(b)(2)(A) and that the approach it has taken in this analysis is reasonable and that, particularly in light of the difficulties of reliably estimating certain benefits and costs, it has discretion to decline to undertake additional or different forms of analysis.

At non-depository institutions, loan officer wages are assumed to be $32.16 per hour, lawyer wages are assumed to be $75.83 per hour, and compliance officer wages are $34.66 per hour.

Thus a transaction secured by a four-unit residential building would be covered by the rule, but a transaction secured by the entire 12-unit apartment complex would not be.

                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Public comments generally.</em> Many commenters offered general support for the proposed rule, with some comments, for example by a large trade association for real estate brokers and agents, offering strong support for its potential to educate and inform consumers about appraisals and other valuations and their role in the real estate transaction. Most of the industry commenters generally supported the proposal and provided numerous suggestions for clarifications or changes to particular elements of the proposal, which are discussed in the corresponding sections below. Some industry commenters including community banks and other lending institutions, however, opposed the proposal. These comments stated, for example, that the mortgage credit industry cannot keep up with the all the regulations being issued under the Dodd-Frank Act and that rules requiring creditors to provide copies of appraisals are already in place.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> As discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to ECOA section 701(e) will take effect 18 months after the designated transfer date under the Dodd-Frank Act unless final rules implementing section 701(e) are issued on or before that date and provide for a different effective date. For that reason, the Bureau believes that, rather than adding burden to industry, this final regulation will relieve industry of uncertainty and potential liability risk that would likely result from ECOA section 701(e) taking effect without an implementing regulation. Furthermore, by issuing this final rule the Bureau is able to provide industry with additional time to develop new policies, train employees, and make system changes to implement the rule's requirements that would not be available if the statute takes effect in January 2013."

As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau did not propose that such waivers extend to the requirement that copies of appraisals and other written valuations be provided in the case of an application that is withdrawn, incomplete, or denied. The Bureau also proposed a new comment 14(a)(1)-4 that would clarify that waivers under \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) are permitted if the applicant makes an affirmative oral or written statement (which can be made by any one applicant in the case of a multiple-applicant transaction) and if the creditor provides the copies of all appraisals and other written valuations at or before consummation.",

An organization advocating for affordable housing suggested a deadline of three days after the creditor's approval, while a real estate agent trade association suggested 10 days after receipt, and an appraisal group suggested 20 days after receipt.",

This commenter suggested that removing the reference to 30 days would ensure lenders can provide an integrated package that includes all appraisal and other valuation documents. Otherwise, an appraisal received earlier in the application process potentially would need to be disclosed before a valuation received later. Other industry commenters embraced the requirement to provide copies of the appraisals and other written valuations three business days before consummation, without expressing support for the 30-day limit in the timing requirement. One industry commenter suggested, however, that the 30-day limit should apply in the case of an incomplete application. Another industry commenter suggested the time period for providing copies should not begin until the application is &#8220;complete&#8221; within the meaning of Regulation B, &#167; 1002.2(f).",

This commenter believed that without this exception, the applicant could receive multiple versions of the same document, with only non-substantive differences. The commenter expressed concern that this result would distract consumers and interfere with their ability to analyze the information received.", 
                                "Finally, one commenter suggested counting the day of consummation for purposes of the three-business-day requirement, and the day of receipt for purposes of the proposed general 30-day limit.",

Several commenters noted that a waiver right would be important to prevent delayed closings. A few comments requested that the final rule provide additional guidance on what constitutes a valid waiver. One creditor trade association suggested this guidance be provided in the form of a safe harbor, including explicit authorization for creditors to seek waivers. Two other creditor trade associations also sought confirmation that creditors could inform consumers of their ability to provide waivers. An appraisal industry commenter suggested, however, that before a creditor could seek a waiver, the creditor should provide a full explanation of the value of receiving the copies in a prompt manner, such as the value the copy may have in negotiations where the valuation estimate is below the originally agreed-upon price.\n            A creditor also requested guidance on whether the waiver can be provided within three days prior to consummation. This commenter cited instances where a delay in receipt of a final appraisal due to minor corrections resulted in a delayed closing because a waiver had not already been executed three or more days before closing.\n            A credit union commenter went further, arguing that consumers should be allowed to waive the timing requirement, regardless of whether the corrections are minor.",

For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is revising this language to provide a simpler rule: The copy must be provided promptly upon completion of the appraisal or other written valuation, or three business days before consummation (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier. The Bureau is including the reference to \u201caccount opening\u201d to accommodate the application of \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) to open-end credit transactions and for consistency with Regulation Z. Regulation Z does not use the term \u201cconsummation\u201d for open-end credit secured by a dwelling. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> &#167; 1026.40 (referring to &#8220;opening&#8221; of home equity plans).",

Comment 14(a)(1)-4.v clarifies that in the absence of a waiver (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> discussion below), the &#8220;promptly upon completion&#8221; requirement governs even if no consummation or account opening occurs.", 
                                "Based upon industry comments noting that appraisals and other valuations may undergo review and revision, the Bureau believes that basing the \u201cpromptly\u201d standard upon the date of receipt could interfere with creditors' review processes or lead to copies being provided to consumers before the review processes are complete. In addition, using the date of receipt as a point of reference could create confusion and uncertainty, as the Dodd-Frank Act amendment of section 701(e) refers to \u201cpromptly upon completion.\u201d Therefore the final rule does not mandate using the date of receipt as the reference point for the timing requirement.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau also is not finalizing the use of a fixed time period from the creditor's receipt of the appraisal as the general standard for determining whether copies are promptly provided to applicants. Upon further consideration, and in light of the public comments received, the Bureau believes that a time period of 30 days of receipt may not result in promptly providing copies to applicants in many instances. Congress' use of the term \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d evidences an intent that applicants should be provided with copies of valuations without delay. As some commenters noted, the earlier these copies are received in the loan process, the more helpful they are to consumers in analyzing the transaction. Applying a fixed 30-day timing requirement could result in applicants not receiving copies of valuations until late in the loan process, even when these valuations have been completed weeks earlier. Thus the final rule does not generally apply a fixed time of 30 days.\n            \n          ", 
                                "However, as a large bank commenter noted, mandating a fixed time frame could reduce the chance that an integrated set of materials could be provided in a transaction involving several types of valuations. Similarly, mandating a fixed time frame of any kind could increase the chances that the creditor would need to make multiple deliveries of copies of appraisals or other valuations. For example, if a creditor receives a valuation from an AVM earlier in the application process, and the fixed time period were to elapse before the appraisal is complete, then the creditor would be required to send the copy of the AVM out before the copy of the appraisal.\n            This would increase burden on creditors, due to an increase in the number of transactions in which creditors would need to make multiple deliveries of copies to applicants.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau notes that a fixed time period is not specified in industry guidelines such as requirements used by the GSEs which purchase or guarantee a significant number of first lien mortgage transactions annually. The timing requirement for providing copies of appraisals in these recently-adopted GSE guidelines is based upon the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC). The HVCC\u2014a standard that had been previously adopted by FHFA in 2008 shortly before Congress began to draft the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014contained a timing standard that is similar to that ultimately included in ECOA section 701(e) as amended.\n            \n          ", 
                                "For the reasons stated above, the commentary to the final rule clarifies that the meaning of the term \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d depends upon the facts and circumstances, including when the creditor receives the appraisal or other written valuation, and when any review or revisions occur. New comment 14(a)(1)-4 also clarifies when \u201ccompletion\u201d occurs for these purposes. Completion occurs when the lender has \u201creviewed and accepted the appraisal or other written valuation to include any changes or corrections required,\u201d or when the creditor receives the last version, whichever is later.\n            \n          ", 
                                "This guidance is then illustrated by several examples in new comment 14(a)(1)-5 of situations in which the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard would or would not be satisfied. While the \u201cpromptly upon completion\u201d standard does not provide the same degree of certainty as a fixed time period, the Bureau believes that the statute specifically contemplates a standard that is flexible.", 
                                "The Bureau's final rule implements the statutory requirement that copies of valuations be provided promptly upon completion, but not later than three days before consummation. As noted in the 2012 ECOA Appraisals Proposal, the Bureau is interpreting \u201cdays\u201d as used in the statute to mean \u201cbusiness days.\u201d The Bureau did not receive comments on this interpretation, and is adopting this standard as proposed.", 
                                "To ensure applicants actually receive the mandated copies at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening (absent waiver), the final rule includes additional guidance in comment 14(a)(1)-4. Under this comment, \u201cprovide\u201d\u2014which is a statutory term in ECOA section 701(e)(4)\n            that is similar to the term \u201cfurnish\u201d in ECOA section 701(e)(1)\u2014is interpreted to mean delivery to the applicant. The comment clarifies that delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copy to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates the applicant actually received the copies, whichever is earlier. The Bureau believes this clarification is consistent with the plain meaning of the applicable terms \u201cfurnish\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d in Dodd-Frank Act section 1474. In addition, this approach is generally consistent with the proposed approach to the three-business-day timing requirement in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.\n            This clarification also should prevent situations in which the creditor mails copies of appraisals or other written valuations to the applicant three business days before consummation or account opening, and the applicant does not receive these materials until after the consummation or account opening. This clarification thus should ensure that applicants have at least the minimum amount of time contemplated by section 701(e) to review these copies before the transaction is consummated or the account is opened.", 
                                "While one commenter requested including the day of consummation in the three-business-day time period that is part of \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1), the final rule does not adopt this approach. Under this approach, if a closing were to occur at 9 a.m. on a Friday, copies of the appraisals and other written valuations could be disclosed at 11:59 p.m. on the preceding Wednesday via email. This would leave the consumer with effectively only one day to review the materials, which would be inconsistent with the three-day requirement in the statute.", 
                                "The waiver provision in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) is revised to clarify that a waiver applies to both components of the general timing requirement, and not only to one aspect of it. As proposed, the waiver would have applied to only one component of the proposed timing requirement, the requirement that copies be provided three business days before closing. Read literally, the proposed waiver provision would not have applied to the other component of the timing requirement, the requirement that copies be provided \u201cpromptly.\u201d As a result, as proposed, applicants would only have been permitted to partially waive the timing requirement.", 
                                "Upon further consideration, the Bureau interprets section 701(e)(2) to permit consumers to provide a waiver of both components of the timing requirements. Otherwise, the effect of a waiver would be unclear, providing a disincentive for applicants and creditors to avail themselves of this provision, even where a waiver would be in the applicant's interest. Additionally, to the extent that the Bureau's final rule departs from the language of the statute in this regard, the Bureau relies on its authority under section 703(a) to make provisions and adjustments to effectuate the purposes of and facilitate or substantiate compliance with ECOA. The Bureau finds that this adjustment is warranted to ensure creditors' ability to obtain and applicants' ability to provide a valid waiver of the timing requirements of \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1).", 
                                "The Bureau is finalizing the provision in proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) that waiver is permitted \u201cexcept where otherwise prohibited by law.\u201d No commenters specifically addressed this provision in the proposed rule, which is based upon the statutory language in ECOA section 701(e)(2). The Bureau continues to believe this limitation is important to clarify that other provisions of law may not permit waiver. For example, the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule under TILA section 129H does not provide for a waiver of the timing requirement for providing copies of written appraisals no later than three business days before consummation.", 
                                "With respect to the form of the waiver, the Bureau is finalizing in renumbered comment 14(a)(1)-6 the provision in proposed comment 14(a)(1)-4 allowing for an affirmative oral or written statement.\n            A more prescriptive, rigid, or specific set of requirements as to the form of the waiver could unduly restrict the applicant's ability to exercise the waiver right. By allowing for an affirmative oral or written waiver, the final rule is designed to allow creditors to apply existing practices such as the standards for waiver of the appraisal copy requirement under the Appraisal Independence Requirements applied by certain GSEs.\n            If the waiver resulted in an applicant not receiving an appraisal or other written valuation at all or until after consummation or account opening, a more prescriptive approach might be warranted. Under the final rule, however, even if the waiver is obtained, creditors are still required to provide the required copies at or before consummation or account opening.", 
                                "With respect to when the waiver must be provided, \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) is revised in the final rule. ECOA section 701(e) is silent on when the waiver must be provided. As noted above, several industry commenters asked the Bureau to provide more guidance on how waivers can occur. The Bureau believes that further clarity on when applicants can provide waivers is important. Under \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) in the final rule, as further clarified in comment 14(a)(1)-6, waivers can be provided in either of two situations: generally before three business days of consummation or account opening,\n            or within three business days of consummation or account opening if certain conditions are met.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that, in general, requests for waivers should not be presented to consumers less than three business days before consummation or account opening. Permitting such requests would, in the Bureau's view, present a risk that consumers would feel unduly pressured to provide waivers in order to avoid delays in closing and that creditors could use such waivers to cure previous violations of the rule's timing requirements. The Bureau is adopting in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) an exception to this general rule, however, governing treatment of waivers pertaining to copies of appraisals or other written valuations containing correction of clerical errors in previously-provided copies.", 
                                "Section 1002.14(a)(1) and the associated comment 14(a)(1)-6.ii therefore clarifies that an applicant can provide a waiver within three business days of consummation or account opening in the following circumstance: the creditor receives a revised version of an appraisal or other written valuation that the applicant already received three business days before consummation or account opening. The option to provide a waiver in this situation would only apply, though, if each of the following criteria are met: (1) The revisions are solely to correct clerical errors in that appraisal or other written valuation; (2) the revisions have no impact on the estimated value; (3) the revisions have no impact on the calculation or methodology used to derive the estimate; and (4) the applicant receives the copy of the revised appraisal or other written valuation at or prior to consummation or account opening. The Bureau believes this approach strikes an appropriate balance by allowing consumers to exercise their waiver right to avoid delays in closing due to last-minute, purely clerical corrections in appraisals and other written valuations.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau is adding language to \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) to clarify the timing requirement in situations where the applicant has provided a waiver, but no consummation or account opening occurs. In that instance, the copy must be provided no later than 30 days after the creditor determines the transaction will not be consummated or the account will not be opened. In the absence of a statutory timeframe applicable to this situation, the Bureau is exercising its authority under ECOA section 703(a) to adopt a reasonable period for providing copies. The Bureau believes that providing a clear rule will reduce compliance burden and risks for creditors, while ensuring that consumers receive copies in a timely fashion. Additionally, the timeframe adopted uses familiar timeframes from longstanding timing requirements for providing copies of appraisals under existing \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2)(ii).\n            \n          "

Having different rules for different means of communication of the copies would introduce additional complexity, especially if not all of the applicants have consented to electronic disclosures. This could have the unintended effect of discouraging creditors from adopting electronic delivery methods. Even if all applicants have consented to delivery by electronic means, the approach suggested by the commenter does not override the general principle that providing copies to one applicant (such as the primary applicant) in a multiple-applicant transaction is sufficient. Indeed, the suggestion of this one industry commenter was not reflected by other commenters, whether in industry or on behalf of consumers. The Bureau therefore believes that a uniform requirement, allowing copies to be provided to one applicant regardless of how they are provided, will best facilitate compliance."

                        "ECOA section 701(e)(1) requires a creditor to provide an applicant a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. This requirement replaced the previous requirement in section 701(e) to provide copies of appraisal reports upon request of the applicant for a loan secured by a lien on a dwelling. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to revise \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) in two important ways: to specify the types of materials that must be provided to consumers (i.e., copies of appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with the application), and to specify the types of transactions for which these copies must be provided (i.e., applications for credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling).", 
                        "First, consistent with new ECOA section 701(e)(1), the Bureau proposed broadening the scope of the valuation materials for which copies must be provided to applicants under \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) to include copies of \u201call written appraisals and valuations developed.\u201d The Bureau further proposed new comment 14(a)(1)-3 to clarify that for purposes of \u00a7 1002.14, a \u201cwritten\u201d appraisal or other valuation would include, without limitation, an appraisal or valuation received or developed by the creditor in any of the following manners: in paper form (hard copy); electronically, such as by CD or email; or by any other similar media. In addition, the proposed comment would have clarified that creditors should look to \u00a7 1002.14(a)(5) regarding the provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations to applicants via electronic means.", 
                        "Second, the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to ECOA section 701(e) also narrowed the types of transactions that are covered to \u201cfirst lien\u201d transactions. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed revising \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) to add the word \u201cfirst\u201d to narrow the scope of the final rule to cover only loans to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed changes to the Regulation B commentary further clarifying the types of transactions subject to the requirement to deliver copies of appraisals and other written valuations. Prior to this final rule, comments 14(a)-1 and 2 had clarified that Regulation B appraisal delivery requirements applied to credit for business purposes and to renewals of credit secured by a dwelling. The Bureau proposed generally retaining these comments (renumbered as comments 14(a)(1)-1 and 2), with several conforming and technical changes. The Bureau proposed comment 14(a)(1)-1 to clarify that \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) covers applications for credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, as the term \u201cdwelling\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1002.14(b)(2), whether the credit is business credit (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1002.2(g)) or consumer credit (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1002.2(h)). The Bureau also proposed comment 14(a)(1)-2 to clarify that &#167; 1002.14(a)(1) applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the creditor develops a new appraisal or other written valuation. Consequently, the Bureau proposed that this comment clarify that &#167; 1002.14(a) does not apply when a creditor uses the appraisals or other valuations that were previously developed in connection with the prior extension of credit in order to evaluate the renewal request.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Public comment.</em> Many commenters provided suggestions on which types of documents would qualify as appraisals or other written valuations copies of which must be provided to applicants.", 
                        "A significant number of industry commenters urged the Bureau to require creditors to provide only \u201cfinal\u201d versions of appraisals and other written valuations, to prevent uncertainty over whether creditors would be required to provide copies of drafts or preliminary versions of these documents. Commenters also suggested this clarification would help to reduce the volume of information that must be provided to and received by applicants, thereby reducing burden on creditors and preventing consumer confusion.", 
                        "Several industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify that ECOA only requires providing copies of appraisals or other written valuations that are actually performed. In addition, a few industry commenters suggested that the Bureau require providing copies of only those appraisals and other written valuations that are used or relied upon by the creditor in making the credit decision. This narrower focus was viewed as more in line with the purpose of ECOA. One commenter requested that creditors should not be required to provide a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that is \u201cmaterially deficient,\u201d as it could confuse the consumer.", 
                        "Some industry commenters expressed a general concern over liability risks raised by the proposed requirement to provide copies of appraisals and other written valuations. These commenters suggested that providing these copies to applicants could create liability risks for creditors and preparers. Some creditors and a creditor trade association expressed concern that applicants might view valuations that lenders conduct in-house, without commissioning an appraisal, as warranting the value of the home. Two creditors and a creditor association in one state expressed concern over the potential for lender liability to carry over to investors under an assignee liability theory, which could reduce access to credit by reducing investor demand. Other industry commenters suggested that applicants might seek to hold an appraiser liable for the applicant's reliance upon the appraisal in entering into a transaction, particularly if the appraiser lists, or is required to list, the applicant as an \u201cintended user\u201d of the appraisal under the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). Some of these commenters raised these concerns over potential liability as part of an overall concern with the potential burden of the regulation, and some urged the Bureau to include provisions in the final rule protecting creditors and preparers of appraisals and other valuations against liability.", 
                        "A number of commenters also urged the Bureau to exclude certain types of transactions from the scope of the final rule. Several industry group commenters requested that the Bureau exempt loan modifications, loss mitigation, short sales, and deed-in-lieu transactions from the rule's requirements altogether. These commenters suggested that these transactions did not involve an \u201capplication\u201d by the consumer for an \u201cextension of credit\u201d within the meaning of ECOA. They also argued that applying the rule to loss mitigation and other foreclosure alternatives would increase the costs of these transactions and decrease their availability to consumers. One industry commenter also suggested that the Bureau clarify that a loan modification did not fit within the type of transaction the rule would cover, because a modification does not lead to \u201cconsummation\u201d of the loan.", 
                        "In addition, an industry commenter requested clarification on whether the rule applies to an annual renewal clause under which a creditor makes a unilateral decision each year whether or not to renew a line of credit. Another industry trade association requested that the final rule exclude temporary loans, such as bridge or construction loans, which it argued are treated specially under other statutes such as RESPA and TILA. For construction loans, this commenter also asserted that applicants are more interested in receiving copies of valuations when the permanent financing begins, after the construction is complete and therefore factored into the valuation.", 
                        "One commenter suggested that the rule should cover second liens to protect consumers in these transactions.

The Bureau does not believe, however, that this clarification is needed in the final rule or its commentary. On its face, section 701(e) of ECOA requires disclosure of copies of the appraisals and other written valuations that are developed in connection with an application. Neither ECOA section 701(e) nor the final rule requires that lenders must obtain appraisals or other written valuations.", 
                        "The final rule also retains the language from the proposed rule\u2014\u201cdeveloped in connection with an application for credit\u201d\u2014for determining which appraisals and other written valuations must be disclosed. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, ECOA section 701(e) referred to appraisals that were \u201cused\u201d in connection with the application. Had Congress intended to maintain that scope, it could have continued to use that term; instead, Congress referred to appraisals and other valuations that are \u201cdeveloped\u201d in connection with the application, without necessarily requiring that they ultimately be \u201cused.\u201d The Bureau assumes this difference in terms reflects a deliberate wording choice by Congress, and the Bureau does not believe consumer protection will be enhanced by adjusting the statutory terminology. If an appraisal or other written valuation is \u201cdeveloped in connection with\u201d an application, then the applicant may benefit from receiving a copy, even if the creditor does not to use the valuation. Some commenters expressed concern that applicants could mistakenly believe that such a valuation was \u201cused\u201d by the creditor. However, there is nothing in the final rule that prohibits creditors from providing information to applicants concerning whether a particular valuation was used.\n            \n          ", 
                        "As noted above, some commenters stated a concern that providing copies of appraisals and other written valuations to applicants could result in liability issues for creditors and preparers of appraisals or other written valuations. Industry commenters noted questions or concerns over whether creditors would be deemed to have warranted home values contained in their internal valuations provided to applicants, and on whether consumers would assert legal claims based upon their reliance on appraisals in deciding whether to enter into transactions. The commenters do not appear to be raising concerns over liability under ECOA section 701(e) itself. On its face, section 701(e) concerns providing copies of certain materials and providing a disclosure. It does not specify the content of valuations or otherwise supply standards regarding what they should contain.\n            Moreover, ECOA has long required creditors to provide copies of appraisals upon request, and creditors routinely provide copies of appraisals for first lien loans including under GSE requirements. The commenters have not explained how requiring that copies of appraisals and other written valuations be provided as a matter of course increases creditors' exposure to liability under legal standards other than ECOA. In any event, as for legal standards other than those contained in ECOA, it is unclear what authority the Bureau would have to limit remedies arising from a creditor's providing copies of appraisals or other written valuations.\n            \n          ", 
                        "With regard to the types of transactions that are covered by the final rule, the Bureau considered industry comments seeking clarification on whether loss mitigation activities, such as loan modifications, short sales, and deed-in-lieu transactions, are covered. These comments implicate provisions of ECOA and Regulation B that turn on whether there is an \u201capplicant\u201d or \u201capplication\u201d for an \u201cextension of credit.\u201d\n            While some loan modifications can be subject to the provisions of Regulation B,\n            including the existing \u00a7 1002.14 disclosure-upon-request regime, there is variation between different types of loss mitigation programs; the particulars of the program at issue are important to understand in evaluating whether there is an application or applicant for an extension of credit within the meaning of Regulation B. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that questions on coverage of these types of transactions are best addressed with reference to the existing provisions of Regulation B.\n            To the extent a loss mitigation transaction is covered by Regulation B, the transaction is covered by the final rule, including its requirement of providing copies of appraisals and other written valuations. Consumers generally will benefit from receiving information about the value of their dwelling, both in the context of making a decision about the loss mitigation transaction and also in detecting potential discrimination, consistent with the purposes of ECOA. The Bureau believes these benefits outweigh the cost to the creditor of providing copies of documentation that the creditor already has received. For the reasons discussed in the Bureau's analysis under section 1022(b) below, the Bureau believes the per-loan cost of providing copies of these materials is modest, and they will often be provided in electronic form. The Bureau is therefore not exercising its exception authority to exempt loss mitigation transactions from \u00a7 1002.14 if those transactions would otherwise be covered by Regulation B.\n            \n          ", 
                        "While the Bureau has considered the comment that the final rule should apply to second lien transactions because they are higher risk, it is not expanding the scope of the final rule to include second liens because such an expansion would be inconsistent with the plain meaning of section 701(e). The Bureau notes that the Dodd-Frank Act specifically limited the scope of ECOA section 701(e) to \u201cfirst liens,\u201d while applying the overlapping requirements under section 129H of TILA to certain subordinate lien loans that meet the definition of \u201chigher risk mortgage.\u201d The commenters have not presented data or other specific information warranting a departure from the plain language of ECOA section 701(e).", 
                        "The final rule maintains comment 14(a)(1)-2, pertaining to credit renewals, with minor changes for consistency and clarity. Comment 14(a)(1)-2 clarifies that creditors must provide copies of appraisals or other written valuations prepared in connection with credit renewals requested by the applicant. Whether an applicant has requested a credit renewal, and when such an application is received for purposes of the timing requirements under \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2), depend on the facts and circumstances of an individual transaction. The remaining part of comment 14(a)(1)-2, clarifying that the rule does not apply to the use of an appraisal or other written valuation that was developed for a prior extension of credit, is adopted as proposed. Because the creditor in a prior transaction covered by the final rule would already have been required to provide a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation to the applicant, requiring the creditor in the subsequent transaction to provide another copy of that appraisal or other written valuation would be duplicative.\n            The Bureau is therefore finalizing comment 14(a)(1)-2 largely as proposed.", 
                        "In response to industry comments, the Bureau has added new comment 14(a)(1)-7, which clarifies what copies must be provided in the event there are multiple versions of an appraisal or other written valuation. The comment clarifies that, if a creditor receives multiple versions of a particular appraisal or other written valuation, then the creditor is required to provide a copy of only the latest version received by the creditor. (<em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> the discussion of comment 14(a)(1)-4 below concerning application of the timing requirements in common situations where there are multiple versions of a particular appraisal or other written valuation.) The Bureau believes this comment is consistent with the language of ECOA section 701(e)(1) requiring copies of appraisals and other valuations to be provided promptly upon &#8220;completion.&#8221; The &#8220;latest version received&#8221; rule thus clarifies that when creditors have multiple versions of a particular appraisal or valuation, they are only required to provide the latest version. The Bureau believes that this guidance will help avoid placing unwarranted burden on creditors and overloading consumers with multiple drafts of a particular appraisal or other written valuation.", 
                        "The Bureau notes, however, that the separate requirements of \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1) for the timing of providing copies to applicants will still apply. The application of the timing requirements to situations in which there are multiple versions of a particular valuation is further discussed below.", 
                        "Comment 14(a)(1)-7 also clarifies that if a creditor provides a version of an appraisal or other written valuation that is later superseded, then the creditor still must provide the latest version. While the Bureau recognizes that this guidance could result in instances in which consumers receive multiple versions of a particular appraisal or other written valuation, it does not believe that this result can be avoided given the statutory requirements.\n          ", 
                        "Comment 14(a)(1)-7 further clarifies that a copy of at least one version of each appraisal or other written valuation must be provided. The Bureau believes this comment is needed to ensure compliance with the statutory requirement that the applicant receive a copy of \u201cany and all\u201d appraisals or other written valuations \u201cdeveloped\u201d in connection with an application. A rule requiring only \u201cfinal\u201d versions to be provided would not be consistent with the statutory requirement, because it would allow creditors to withhold a valuation that they determine is a draft or preliminary, even if they never receive a later version. The statute does not distinguish between valuations that are preliminary and those that are final or valuations that the creditor chooses to rely on and those it does not.", 
                        "Additionally, the Bureau does not believe that such a rule would be consistent with the purposes of ECOA's requirement regarding furnishing copies of appraisals and other written valuations. The chief purpose of this provision is to promote transparency regarding the loan process to assist applicants in determining whether they may be the victims of discrimination. This purpose would be frustrated if creditors could subjectively determine which valuations to provide. Accordingly, comment 14(a)(1)-7 clarifies that when there is only one version of a particular appraisal or other written valuation, a copy must be provided to the applicant regardless of whether the creditor relied on it or viewed it as being preliminary."

                                "Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act added two new appraisal-related disclosure requirements for consumers. New section 701(e)(5) of ECOA, which is implemented in this final rule, provides as follows: \u201cAt the time of application, the creditor shall notify an applicant in writing of the right to receive a copy of each written appraisal and valuation under this subsection.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1691(e)(5). Similarly, section 129H(d) of TILA, as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides as follows: \u201cAt the time of the initial mortgage application, the applicant shall be provided with a statement by the creditor that any appraisal prepared for the mortgage is for the sole use of the creditor, and that the applicant may choose to have a separate appraisal conducted at the expense of the applicant.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1639h(d). In the absence of regulatory action to harmonize the two provisions, creditors would be required to provide two appraisal-related disclosures to consumers for certain loans (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> a TILA and an ECOA disclosure for higher-risk mortgage loans secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling) and just one for certain others (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> an ECOA disclosure for first-lien, dwelling-secured loans that are not higher-risk mortgage loans, or a TILA disclosure for higher-risk mortgage loans secured by a subordinate lien).", 
                                "Given that the ECOA and TILA disclosures were both created by the same legislation (the Dodd-Frank Act) to address overlapping subject matter (provision of copies of appraisals) in many of the same transactions (first liens secured by dwellings), the Bureau believes that Congress did not intend the disclosure requirements to be implemented in a disjointed manner that might cause consumer confusion and compliance burden for creditors. As explained in the proposal, the Bureau believes the combined disclosure will allow for additional text necessary to promote consumer comprehension, while also reducing compliance burden for industry by allowing for a single disclosure to satisfy both statutory requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau believes this approach serves the interests of consumers, the public, and creditors. On this basis, the Bureau proposed to exercise its authority under section 703(a) of ECOA and section 1405(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to conform the two disclosure requirements. In connection with the proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) requirement of notifying applicants of their \u201cright to receive a copy of all written appraisals and valuations developed in connection with [their] application,\u201d the Bureau proposed revising the sample disclosure form C-9 for appraisals in Regulation B to include language to satisfy the new appraisal-related disclosure requirements of both ECOA and TILA.", 
                                "As part of its larger Know Before You Owe public outreach project, which is described in more detail in Part III above, the Bureau tested several versions of the new appraisal-related disclosures, all of which combined the disclosures required by both ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H. This testing included consumers and industry participants.\n            The Bureau believed that it was important to test both disclosures together in order to determine how best to provide disclosures required by ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H in a manner that would minimize consumer confusion and improve consumer comprehension. Testing showed that consumers tended to find the combined TILA and ECOA disclosures confusing when they used specific language set forth in the statute. Consumer comprehension improved when the Bureau developed a slightly longer plain language disclosure that was designed to incorporate the elements of both statutes.\n            Based upon the results of that testing, the Bureau developed and tested the following sample disclosure language it proposed to include in Form C-9: \u201cWe may order an appraisal to determine the property's value and charge you for this appraisal. We will promptly give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost.\u201d", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Public comment.</em> Industry commenters generally supported development of sample disclosure language that meets the disclosure requirements of both ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H. Commenters said this approach would increase consumer understanding and reduce creditor burden and cost, eliminating the need for multiple, partially duplicative disclosures. Several commenters requested that the sample disclosure include additional clarifying language.", 
                                "First, some industry commenters suggested the sample disclosure include an explanation of creditor use of applicant-ordered appraisals. These comments suggested that applicants should either be told that creditors are prohibited from using such appraisals, or that borrowers should be notified that creditors are under no obligation to use the appraisals. One commenter also suggested that confusion on this issue could be avoided by simply removing language concerning the right of applicants to order their own appraisals. Comments by two national associations of creditors suggested the final rule provide guidance confirming that creditors could vary the text of the disclosure to exclude the sentence about applicant-ordered appraisals, as ECOA did not require this sentence.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Second, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to include the word \u201cvaluation\u201d in the sample consumer disclosure describing the materials the consumer may receive. Commenters generally believed this additional language would help consumers to understand that some of the information they receive may not be appraisals, and in some cases they might not receive an appraisal.", 
                                "Other industry commenters offered other suggestions. These ranged from informing consumers that the time frame for \u201cpromptly\u201d providing the copies would begin from when the creditor receives the appraisal or other valuation, to advising consumers that the creditor could charge for additional copies of appraisals or other valuations beyond the first copy provided.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> While the Bureau has considered the comments described above, the Bureau is adopting the sample disclosure language in form C-9 as proposed. The 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule under TILA section 129H allows for an appraisal notice that is the same as the language in form C-9, thus preserving the option of using a single disclosure to satisfy both rules.", 
                                "The Bureau is not modifying the sentence regarding applicant-ordered appraisals. The language informing applicants they can order their own additional appraisals is included in the sample disclosure in form C-9 so that this disclosure can also be used to satisfy the requirements of the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule under TILA section 129H, as discussed above, and more broadly to educate consumers (whether or not they are applying for a higher risk mortgage subject to TILA section 129H) on their right to order an additional appraisal for their own use. If this information were not included in the sample disclosure, then it could not be used to satisfy the requirements under TILA section 129H and its implementing regulation, the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule. Therefore the final rule maintains this portion of the sample disclosure in form C-9. To address industry comments suggesting borrowers might try to compel lenders to use applicant-ordered appraisals in an inappropriate manner, new comment 14(a)(2)-1 is being included in the final rule. This comment clarifies that the rule does not affect restrictions on creditor use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors. The Bureau does not believe, however, that the concise, tested language in the sample disclosure should be expanded to discuss these standards, which are complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, industry commenters differed in their views on whether or how creditors may use these appraisals. Elaborating on this language in the sample disclosure to inform consumers that creditors cannot use or are not obligated to use the appraisals applicants may order, without a more detailed explanation of the standards governing the creditor conduct in the appraisal process, could discourage consumers from ordering their own appraisal as a means of disputing the appraisal ordered by the creditor, if they were to choose to do so.\n            Such information could detract from consumer comprehension of the disclosure, and in any event is not required by ECOA section 701(e).", 
                                "On the issue of whether to include the word \u201cvaluations\u201d in the text of the consumer disclosure, the Bureau is not persuaded that this additional language would improve consumer comprehension and understanding. Consumer testing of an earlier version of the sample disclosure language, conducted in connection with the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal, indicated that consumers preferred a disclosure that did not include the word \u201cvaluation\u201d, as simpler and easier to understand. While ECOA section 701(e) calls for a disclosure that includes this word, as noted above, the Bureau is exercising its exception authority so that the disclosure under section 701(e) can be harmonized with TILA section 129H, which, among other differences, does not refer to \u201cvaluations.\u201d Based upon consumer testing indicating the proposed text was easier to understand without the word \u201cvaluation,\u201d and because allowing a single disclosure option for creditors that satisfies both regulations under ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H reduces creditor burden and the volume of consumer disclosures, the Bureau believes this exception would facilitate compliance and consumer understanding. If the term \u201cvaluations\u201d were included in the text of the consumer disclosure, the disclosure would not be the same as the disclosure for subordinate lien transactions (which are not subject to section 701(e)), detracting from the unified approach that industry commenters widely supported. Regardless, if a non-appraisal valuation is developed in connection with a creditor's credit decision, then a copy of that valuation must be provided under the final rule. The final rule does not regulate communications at the time the valuation copy is provided. Creditors may choose to include explanations of the non-appraisal valuation, if one is provided. The Bureau believes that allowing voluntary description by the creditor at the point of providing copies is preferable to mandating a more complex up-front disclosure that could generate consumer confusion. In summary, the Bureau believes that the unified disclosure benefits both consumers and creditors because it clearly communicates basic information required by both ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H in one disclosure.", 
                                "The Bureau notes, however, that proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) would have required notifying applicants of their right to receive not only an appraisal, but also a \u201cvaluation.\u201d This may have led to some of the commenters' suggestions of including the term \u201cvaluation\u201d in the sample disclosure. Accordingly, for the sake of clarity, and to confirm that sample disclosure C-9 (whose text does not refer to the word \u201cvaluation\u201d) would satisfy the disclosure requirement in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2), the final rule modifies the disclosure requirement to delete the word \u201cvaluation.\u201d\n            This change is made based upon the same exercise of the exception authority used to develop form C-9, discussed above. The Bureau believes this change will prevent confusion as to what language is required to be included in the disclosure.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The final rule also does not adopt other changes industry commenters suggested for the sample consumer disclosure, as consumer testing did not suggest these changes are necessary. For example, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to modify the sample disclosure to inform consumers that applicants can be charged for additional copies beyond the first copy. The sample disclosure already only refers to the right to receive \u201ca copy\u201d without charge. Consumer testing did not indicate that consumers were concerned about what could happen if they wanted additional copies. The Bureau also does not believe that the sample disclosure should be revised to state when the time period for \u201cpromptly\u201d providing the copies begins. The sample disclosure already states the creditor will promptly provide a copy of an appraisal the creditor may order in the future. This language already implies that the creditor will first need to receive and if necessary review the original before it makes copies. Consumer testing indicated a strong preference for succinct, focused language in the appraisals disclosure, and did not suggest consumers wanted additional clarification on the precise nature of the timing requirement.", 
                                "Finally, to clarify the extent to which the text in sample disclosure from C-9 can be modified by creditors, the Bureau is revising the commentary. If the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal is adopted as proposed, that rule would require including in the TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate the same language as this final rule adopts in the sample disclosure form C-9, without variation. On the other hand, the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal and the mandatory forms proposed therein would not apply to open-end credit or reverse mortgage transactions. Therefore the potential to modify the language in the sample disclosure may depend on the applicability of laws and regulations other than ECOA and this final rule. Comment Appendix C-1-ii therefore is revised to clarify that creditors may modify the model form C-9 unless otherwise provided by law.\n            This comment, as revised, addresses the commenter question of whether the sentence in form C-9 referring to applicant-ordered appraisals can be modified (or deleted); as the comment suggests, the sentence could not be changed if the sentence is required by another applicable regulation, such as the consumer disclosure requirement in the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule under TILA section 129H applicable to higher-risk mortgages. This change to the commentary also clarifies that this or any other modification would not be permitted in a transaction that is subject to the TILA-RESPA rule that the Bureau finalizes in the future, to the extent that final rule maintains the mandatory forms from the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal."

The Bureau interprets the phrase \u201cat the time of application\u201d to require creditors to provide the ECOA appraisal disclosure not later than three business days after receiving an application. The Bureau's proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) would have required creditors to notify applicants in writing, not later than the third business day after a creditor receives such application, of the right to receive a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with such application.",

                                "The Bureau stated in the preamble to its ECOA proposal that it believes this approach is warranted because providing the disclosure to applicants at the same time as other similar disclosures\u2014and (once adopted) as part of a broader integrated disclosure document\u2014would allow consumers to read the notification in context with other important information that must be delivered not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the application. Such an approach could reduce the number of pieces of paper that consumers receive and facilitate compliance by creditors.",

Several commenters cited the ability to integrate the ECOA appraisal disclosure into the integrated TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate when adopted as a reason for supporting the timing requirement in the proposed rule. While one commenter suggested the disclosure could be better timed as part of the application process itself, other commenters said it would be burdensome for lenders to provide the disclosure at that time. One commenter also suggested the deadline for the disclosure be extended to 10 business days.",

In this type of situation, the comment recommended that the final rule either clarify that the disclosure requirement applies only if the initial loan application contemplates the lender taking a first lien on a dwelling, or provide the creditor an opportunity to cure and provide the disclosure at some later point in the application process when it becomes apparent a dwelling will be used as collateral.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> Consistent with most of comments received on the timing of the disclosure, the final rule maintains the three-business day timing requirement for the reasons stated in the proposal. This time period allows lenders to align ECOA appraisal disclosures with TILA-RESPA early disclosures in transactions that are covered by TILA and RESPA. Earlier timing requirements would place additional burden on creditors, while later timing requirements could result in an unwarranted departure from the statutory time frame. To ensure consistency with the requirements of TILA and RESPA, including section 129H of TILA, the final rule also includes new conforming language in &#167; 1002.14(a)(2) providing that the disclosure shall be mailed or delivered not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The final rule includes an exception to this requirement, however.

The Bureau believes this is a reasonable interpretation of the statute in the absence of a specific provision in ECOA section 701(e) on this point. ECOA section 701(e)(5) calls for a notice \u201cat the time of application,\u201d but does not address the timing of the notice when the creditor does not know at that time that the credit will be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. The Bureau is therefore exercising its authority under ECOA section 703(a) to provide a timeframe for notification in this situation to assist creditors in complying with rule and to ensure that applicants involved in these transactions receive the notice.", 
                                "The Bureau also notes that it did not receive comments on its proposal to set the start of the three-day time period as the time when the creditor receives the \u201capplication.\u201d The Bureau is finalizing the use of this term as proposed. Because Regulation B already defines the term \u201capplication\u201d in \u00a7 1002.2(f) with reference to the creditor's \u201cprocedures\u201d for receiving a request for credit, the Bureau believes this approach will permit creditors to setup their procedures to align the timing for the appraisal notice with other disclosure requirements."

                        "ECOA section 701(e)(3) affirms that creditors may require applicants to pay reasonable fees to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the appraisal, except where otherwise required in law. Section 701(e)(4) provides, however, that creditors shall provide a \u201cfree\u201d copy of each appraisal or other written valuation at no additional cost to the applicant. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) to implement section 701(e)(3) and (4), as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and provide greater clarity. The Bureau stated in the preamble to its proposal that it interpreted these two provisions to permit creditors to charge applicants reasonable fees to reimburse the creditor for costs of the appraisal or other valuation itself, but not for photocopying, postage, or similar costs associated with providing one written copy to the applicant. Thus the Bureau proposed removing current comment 14(a)(2)(ii)-1, which permits creditors to charge photocopy and postage costs incurred in providing a copy to the applicant.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed that \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) affirm that creditors may impose fees to reimburse the costs of appraisals or other valuations. ECOA section 701(e)(3) does not expressly refer to valuations, and thus does not expressly permit or prohibit creditors from charging reasonable fees to reimburse the cost of valuations. The Bureau stated that because ECOA section 701(e)(3) does expressly permit such fees for \u201cappraisals,\u201d legislative intent with respect to other types of \u201cvaluations\u201d is unclear. The Bureau stated that it believed that there is both consumer and industry benefit to affirming that creditors may charge reasonable fees for reimbursement for all types of property valuations. Absent such clarification, the statutory language might be read as implicitly forbidding creditors from charging reimbursement fees for obtaining certain types of valuations, such as broker-price opinions or AVM reports, but not for others, such as appraisals. The Bureau stated that it did not believe that Congress intended such a result, which could create an incentive for creditors to favor full appraisals over less costly forms of valuation that may be appropriate in particular circumstances.\n            Such a result would impose additional costs on loan applicants. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to interpret section 701(e)(3) of ECOA as permitting creditors to charge applicants a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of developing an appraisal or other valuation, except as otherwise provided by law. In proposing this interpretation, to the extent necessary, the Bureau proposed to rely on the authority provided in ECOA section 703(a) to provide adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed that comment 14(a)(3)-2 clarify that \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) would not prohibit the creditor from charging a fee reasonably designed to reimburse costs incurred in connection with obtaining appraisal and other valuations services, but would not permit increasing the fee for the appraisal or other valuation to cover costs of providing documentation under \u00a7 1002.14. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believed that ECOA section 701(e)(3) and (4) did not call for more prescriptive rate regulation of valuation-related activities. By contrast, section 1472 of the Dodd-Frank Act created TILA section 129E, which specifically imposes a criterion for appraiser fees\u2014that they be \u201creasonable and customary\u201d in the market area where the property is located\u2014and specified various sources for determining whether fees meet the standard. The Bureau therefore stated that it did not believe that Congress intended ECOA section 701, which focuses on the provision of copies of written valuation documents to loan applicants rather than the substantive performance of appraisal and other valuation services, to function in such a manner. Accordingly, the Bureau stated that it believed that section 701(e)(3) and (4) is simply designed to prevent direct or indirect \u201cupcharging\u201d related to the provision of documents that is the focus of this section of the statute.", 
                        "To clarify the statutory language stating that creditors cannot seek reimbursement for the cost of the appraisal \u201cwhere otherwise required in law,\u201d the Bureau also proposed that comment 14(a)(3)-2 note that other laws may separately prohibit creditors from charging fees to reimburse the costs of appraisals, and are not overridden by section 701(e)(3). For instance, section 1471 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires creditors to obtain a second interior appraisal in connection with certain higher-risk mortgages, but prohibits creditors from charging applicants for the cost of the second appraisal. TILA section 129H(b)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(B).",

In addition, comment 14(a)(3)-2 was proposed to clarify that \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) does not prohibit creditors from imposing fees that are reasonably designed to reimburse the creditor for costs incurred in connection with obtaining actual appraisal or other valuation services, so long they are not increased to cover the costs of providing copies required under \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1).",

                        "No commenters opposed the proposal to allow creditors to charge reasonable fees for appraisals and other valuations unless otherwise provided by law. One industry commenter requested that the rule explicitly allow the fee to cover costs charged by appraisal management companies (AMCs), which can be either a component of or supplemental to the cost of the appraisal. This commenter argued that Congress did not intend to prohibit AMC fees in the Dodd-Frank Act, as it specifically provided for their disclosure in the settlement statement pursuant to RESPA section 4(c). 12 U.S.C. 2603(c). Another industry commenter suggested that the final rule interpret \u201creasonable fee\u201d to mean a fee that was disclosed and agreed to by the applicant. A different industry commenter requested additional clarification on what could not be charged under this provision.\n            \n          ", 
                        "In addition, several industry commenters requested that the rule allow creditors to withhold copies of the appraisals and other valuations if the borrower did not pay the permitted fees to reimburse the cost of appraisals and other valuations. Some commenters noted this type of exception would be particularly important in transactions where the application is withdrawn, incomplete, or denied. One commenter also requested that disclosure required under section 14(a)(2) inform the consumer of the ability of the creditor to withhold these copies.", 
                        "Industry commenters were generally supportive of the proposed prohibition on charges for providing copies of appraisals and other written valuations. While a large internet lender specifically agreed with the proposed prohibition, a few lending institutions objected to the proposed prohibition on the grounds that it would force them to absorb additional costs. Because proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) and comment 14(a)(3)-1 referred to a prohibition on charges for providing \u201ca copy,\u201d several industry commenters suggested this could be read as prohibiting charges for providing duplicate or additional copies. These commenters therefore requested that the final rule clarify that creditors could charge for subsequent copies of appraisals and other written valuations. A large industry trade association also noted a concern over whether the prohibition against charging for copies of appraisals and other written valuations would prohibit indirect recovery of these costs.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> Section 1002.14(a)(3) in the final rule and associated commentary are generally adopted as proposed, with some minor clarifications as discussed below.", 
                        "As in the proposal, \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) in the final rule clarifies that charges for valuations are not prohibited by section 701(e)(3) of ECOA. No commenters addressed this provision in the proposal. As noted in the proposal, in adopting this provision in the final rule, the Bureau relies to the extent necessary on its authority to make adjustments under section 703(a) of ECOA. Such an adjustment would facilitate compliance with ECOA and prevent circumvention, and also would effectuate the purposes of ECOA. Otherwise, ECOA section 701(e)(3) might be interpreted as distinguishing between one type of valuation (an \u201cappraisal\u201d) whose cost may be reimbursed by applicants, and all other types of valuations whose cost may not be reimbursed by the applicant. Yet the definition of \u201cvaluation\u201d in section 701(e)(6) of ECOA refers broadly to \u201cany estimate of the value of a dwelling,\u201d without distinguishing between these types of valuations. Under such an interpretation, the Bureau would need to provide guidance on how to distinguish between appraisal and non-appraisal valuations; without such guidance, creditors could deliberately or inadvertently mischaracterize non-appraisal valuations as appraisals to recover their cost, or creditors may avoid valuations altogether to avoid incurring unrecoverable costs. Additionally, as noted in the proposal, a distinction between the ability to recover costs for appraisals versus other types of valuations could discourage creditors from using less costly forms of valuations, especially in smaller dollar-amount transactions. For example, Federal banking regulations do not require federally-insured financial institutions to obtain an appraisal in low-risk real estate-related financial transactions in which the transaction value is $250,000 or less.\n            It is not the purpose of ECOA section 701(e) to encourage one type of valuation over another; its purpose is to inform the consumer of the basis for the credit decision. Thus the adjustment in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) will ensure the final rule adheres more closely to the purpose of ECOA as well.", 
                        "At the same time, comment 14(a)(3)-2 in the final rule clarifies that in allowing reasonable fees to reimburse\n            the cost of appraisals and other valuations, \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) is not intended to create a legal obligation of the applicant to pay these fees. As noted above, one commenter suggested a link between the concept of a \u201creasonable fee,\u201d and whether the fee was disclosed and agreed to by the consumer. While the Bureau does not believe that the term \u201creasonable fee\u201d could be equated in all cases with fees disclosed to and agreed by the applicant, the commenter highlights the relevance of the applicant's agreement to pay the fee. Whether the legal obligation to pay the fee exists is a matter arising under other laws, including without limitation contract law, however. Other laws also may limit the ability to recover these fees, as indicated by the phrase \u201cunless otherwise provided by law\u201d in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3).\n            \n          ", 
                        "In response to the comment seeking clarification that \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) does not limit the recoverability of AMC charges, the Bureau recognizes that the Dodd-Frank Act did not intend to prohibit recovery of AMC fees. As the commenter noted, RESPA section 4(c) allows but does not require creditors to break out the AMC fees on the settlement statement from the fees paid directly to the appraiser. The commenter suggests that recoverability of AMC fees was left in doubt by the proposed comment 14(a)(3)-2, referring to fees \u201creasonably designed\u201d to reimburse creditor costs incurred \u201cin connection with obtaining\u201d appraisal and other valuation services. To clarify, the Bureau is revising comment 14(a)(3)-2 so its language more closely tracks ECOA section 701(e) (which refers to \u201creasonable fees\u201d to reimburse appraisal costs, rather than fees that are \u201creasonably designed\u201d for this purpose) and to specifically indicate that section 14(a)(3) is not intended to prohibit recovery of AMC fees.", 
                        "The final rule also adopts the prohibition in proposed \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) against charging for providing a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation \u201cas required under the final rule.\u201d While industry commenters raised a question of whether creditors could charge for providing additional copies of the same appraisal or other written valuation, such as when the applicant requests them, the Bureau does not believe that the regulation is unclear on this point. The final rule, in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1), requires only that the creditor provide \u201ca copy\u201d of each appraisal or other written valuation. The prohibition against charging for copies only applies to copies that are \u201crequired under the final rule.\u201d Because the final rule does not require that creditors provide more than one copy, there is no suggestion in the final rule that creditors are prohibited from charging for duplicates or additional copies. If they do provide additional duplicate copies, it would not be pursuant to a requirement in the rule. The Bureau also does not believe the rule requires, as one commenter suggested, the tracking of mailing or copying costs and even their refund to the consumer to ensure they are not included in the interest rate previously set.\n            \n          ", 
                        "To fully implement the prohibition in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(3) against charging for providing a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation, the Bureau also is amending the commentary to sample disclosure form C-9. Comment Appendix C-1-ii is revised to remove the suggestion that a creditor may add text to the disclosure notifying the applicant of the cost the applicant will be required to pay for a copy of the report.", 
                        "The Bureau declines to add an exception in the final rule to the requirement to provide copies of appraisals and other written valuations where the applicant has not paid the fee for the appraisal or other written valuation. Section 1002.14(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation B currently calls for providing the copy after receipt of the request, the report, or reimbursement for the report, \u201cwhichever is last to occur.\u201d As proposed, \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) would no longer have based the timing of disclosure upon the receipt of payment. The Bureau believes this approach is consistent with the language of ECOA section 701(e) as amended. The statutory timing requirement concerning providing copies contains no reference to receipt of reimbursement for the valuation from the applicant. Moreover, ECOA section 701(e)(4) specifically states that \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the creditor's ability to charge a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor's appraisal costs, the creditor \u201cshall provide\u201d the copy at no additional cost. The Bureau does not believe that conditioning the creditor's obligation to provide copies at no additional cost on the applicant's reimbursement of the costs of the appraisal or other written valuation would be consistent with legislative intent as expressed in ECOA section 701.", 
                        "The Bureau understands the need for creditors to manage payment risks. The final rule does not affect the ability of creditors to request up-front payment from applicants before appraisals or other written valuations are ordered (which would protect creditors even if the application is withdrawn, incomplete, or denied), to collect payment at consummation or account opening, or to undertake other efforts to collect the fee if the transaction is not consummated or the account is not opened. The Bureau therefore declines to adopt this exception suggested by comments it received."

The statute did not distinguish between withdrawals that occur before or after declaring an intent to proceed with the transaction. While the commenter suggested the Bureau should exercise its exception authority in cases in which the application is withdrawn before the applicant expresses an intent to proceed, the Bureau is not persuaded there is a basis for doing so here. The &#8220;intent to proceed&#8221; standard governs whether fees can be charged to applicants under Regulation X, which implements RESPA, and not when applicants have a protected interest against discrimination under ECOA. The Bureau does not believe that the purpose of ECOA in preventing, detecting, and remedying discrimination would be served by providing such an exception. Under Regulation X, &#167; 1024.7(a)(4), the intent to proceed comes after the applicant has received a good faith estimate (or a revised good faith estimate), which quotes loan terms to applicants and which could be based upon an appraisal or other written valuation. Indeed, in some cases the very reason that the consumer elects to withdraw the application may be the result of what the lender has said or done in response to the appraisal or other valuation, for example by changing the interest rate based on a lower-than-expected loan to value ratio. Therefore the text of &#167; 1002.14(a)(4) is adopted as proposed."

In the 1993 Final Rule, the Board pointed to pre-existing NCUA regulations, and how they already required credit unions to provide copies of appraisals upon request.\n            The Board also cited the legislative history of the 1991 ECOA amendments, which indicated Congress was aware of these pre-existing regulations and thus did not intend to modify them.\n            Accordingly, the Board found it unnecessary to require under Regulation B what the NCUA already required under its own regulations.", 
                                "Under today's version of the NCUA regulation, 12 CFR 701.31(c)(5), Federal credit unions are still required to make available to any requesting member/applicant a copy of the appraisal used in connection with that member's real estate-related loan application. However, as described above, the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to ECOA removed the prior provisions of section 701(e) and replaced them with requirements that were significantly broader in scope. Unlike the prior provisions of section 701(e), section 701(e) as amended requires creditors to provide copies of all valuations, and not only appraisals; section 701(e) also requires that creditors provide these copies automatically, rather than allowing them to be provided upon request. Thus amended section 701(e) guarantees that applicants will receive copies of valuations that are performed, including non-appraisal valuations, and regardless of whether applicants specifically request the copies. In addition, neither section 1474 of the Dodd-Frank Act nor its legislative history refers to an exception for credit unions subject to, and complying with, the provisions of the NCUA regulations relating to making appraisals available upon request. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed deleting the exemption for credit unions provided in \u00a7 1002.14(b).", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Public comment.</em> Most credit union commenters urged the Bureau to maintain the exemption for credit unions, suggesting, for example, that the existing rule (requiring disclosure on request) be maintained and that credit unions did not need to be covered by the new rule because they were not a cause of the financial crisis that the Dodd-Frank Act was intended to address. One of the commenters argued that the Bureau should maintain the exemption in order to allow the NCUA to amend its regulations to conform to section 701(e) of ECOA. Some of these commenters suggested the proposed rule would be burdensome, particularly when viewed in combination with the other rules being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. One credit union stated, however, that it understood the Bureau's proposed rationale for removing the exemption in Regulation B. An appraisal industry commenter also stated that it supported removing the exemption.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> As noted in the proposal, Congress did not exclude credit unions from the requirements of ECOA section 701(e), and the legislative history of the Dodd-Frank Act did not suggest Congress intended to exclude credit unions, unlike when Congress adopted the previous version of section 701(e) in 1991. Moreover, even assuming credit unions may have had a lesser role in precipitating the financial crisis to which the Dodd-Frank Act responded, the purposes of ECOA include preventing and remedying unlawful discrimination in credit transactions. By including the requirement to provide copies of appraisals and other written valuations in ECOA, Congress made the judgment that enhanced transparency of appraisals and other written valuations would further these purposes. In addition, applicants to credit unions have an equal interest in the protection and remedies afforded by ECOA as applicants to other creditors. Failure to apply the rule to credit unions would result in applicants to these creditors not having the same guarantees of receiving copies of appraisals and other written valuations promptly (regardless of whether they request them), or of receiving copies of non-appraisal valuations at all. In addition, the Bureau is not persuaded by the comments that the final rule implementing section 701(e) would impose a significant additional burden on creditors, as credit union commenters did not establish that credit unions do not follow the general industry practice of providing copies of appraisals to applicants in first lien transactions.\n            The Bureau therefore is not persuaded that the standards for exercising its exception authority are met, whether under section 703(a) of ECOA to effectuate the purposes of, or foster compliance with, ECOA or under section 1405(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect the interests of consumers and the public.\n            Accordingly, the final rule does not include an exemption for credit unions."

While one commenter noted that the appraisal is not a contract document, Section 101(a) of the E-Sign Act governing electronic signatures in contracts is not the provision at issue here. Rather, Section 101(c) of the E-Sign Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001(c), governs consent for provision of consumer disclosures by electronic means. The commenter therefore has not articulated a basis for treating copies of appraisals and other written valuations as falling outside the scope of Section 101(c). In any event, however, applying the E-Sign Act requirements to provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations by electronic means would not force creditors to institute E-Sign Act compliance procedures. Creditors could simply choose not to provide the copies by electronic means.", 
                        "The Bureau also notes that because the disclosure required by \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) is a written disclosure required by Regulation B, \u00a7 1002.4(d)(2) will permit that disclosure to be provided electronically based upon a consent given in compliance with the E-Sign Act. There is no need to restate this point in a separate provision within \u00a7 1002.14. As discussed at the beginning of the section-by-section analysis above, the Bureau is revising the electronic disclosure provision in \u00a7 1002.4(d)(2), however, to ensure its exception can apply to the new notice required by \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) of the final rule, which replaces the consumer notice required by existing \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2)(i). While this change was not proposed in the proposal, this revision is necessary to maintain the consistency of cross-references in Regulation B and its existing approach to electronic disclosure of the consumer notice required under \u00a7 1002.14. In particular, existing \u00a7 1002.4(d)(2) allows the creditor to provide written disclosures required by certain specified provisions of existing Regulation B, including existing \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2)(i), electronically without regard to consumer consent or provisions of the E-Sign Act, if the disclosure \u201caccompan[ies] an application accessed by the applicant in electronic form.\u201d The Bureau believes this cross-reference in \u00a7 1002.4(d)(2) to the notice requirement in \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) should be maintained, for the same reasons the Board did not apply the E-Sign Act requirements to disclosures provided with the application.\n            In addition, creditors could choose to provide the notice as an accompanying disclosure with the application, which would, by definition, be provided within three business days of the application as required by this final rule.\n            Therefore, the cross-reference is being updated to reflect the citation to the disclosure provision in the final rule, \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2)."

Specifically, \u00a7 1002.14(b)(2) proposed to define the term \u201cdwelling\u201d as a residential structure that contains one to four units whether or not that structure is attached to real property, and including but not limited to an individual condominium or cooperative unit, and a mobile or other manufactured home.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Public comment.</em> Industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify several aspects of the definition of &#8220;dwelling.&#8221; For example, several commenters asked the Bureau to clarify in the final rule whether the definition of &#8220;dwelling&#8221; refers only to an owner-occupied dwelling, or to any residential dwelling regardless of the applicant's residence in the building. Several commenters in the manufactured housing industry also requested that the definition of &#8220;dwelling&#8221; exclude residential structures that are not attached to the real property, such as recreational vehicles and house boats, as well as manufactured homes when titled as chattel. Further, some industry commenter asked for clarification on whether the rule applies to commercial transactions. Some of these comments requested that the final rule exclude commercial transactions even when they involve a first lien on a dwelling. One commenter argued, however, that covering commercial transactions would promote education, knowledge, and creditor safety and soundness by ensuring applicants are aware of the appraisals and other valuations on which the credit decisions are based. In addition, some industry commenters requested clarification on whether the final rule would cover certain multiple residence situations involving a single lot, such as three four-unit buildings situated on a single land parcel and operated as one small 12-unit apartment complex. Finally, one commenter suggested the definition of &#8220;dwelling&#8221; be harmonized with the definition in Regulation C promulgated under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), which is not limited to one-to-four-family structures, while another commenter suggested the definition be limited to single-family housing.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> The final rule does not exclude business credit when it is secured by a first lien on a dwelling because business credit is covered by ECOA and Regulation B. ECOA section 701(e) applies to a &#8220;creditor&#8221;, a term that ECOA section 702(e) defines by reference to the term &#8220;credit&#8221; in section 702(d). Section 702(d) of ECOA does not limit the term &#8220;credit&#8221; to credit for personal, family, or household purposes, and Regulation B has long interpreted &#8220;credit&#8221; to include personal and &#8220;business credit.&#8221; <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comment 1002.2(j)-1 (discussing definition of &#8220;credit&#8221; in &#167; 1002.2(j));\n            &#167; 1002.2(g) (definition of &#8220;business credit&#8221;).\n            Thus, the final rule covers applications for business credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.", 
                        "The final rule adopts the definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d as proposed. When describing the transactions subject to section 701(e) of ECOA, Dodd-Frank Act section 1474 used the term \u201cdwelling\u201d, which has been defined in \u00a7 1002.14(c) as follows: \u201c[T]he term dwelling means a residential structure that contains one to four units whether or not that structure is attached to real property. The term includes, but is not limited to, an individual condominium unit, and a mobile or other manufactured home.\u201d\n            Given that this definition was in place when Congress amended ECOA section 701(e) and used the term \u201cdwelling\u201d in specifying the scope of the requirement, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to continue to use the existing definition of \u201cdwelling.\u201d", 
                        "The definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d in \u00a7 1002.14(c) requires that the unit be a \u201cresidential structure\u201d, but does not require that it be \u201cowner-occupied.\u201d As a result, the requirements of the final rule can apply to transactions involving one-to-four-unit residential structures that may be business or commercial in nature, including for investment purposes. Beyond this, whether a transaction meets the definition will depend on the facts and circumstances. Because transaction structures can vary widely, the Bureau does not believe it would be efficient or appropriate to try to address all such variations in the text of the rule or the commentary.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d in Regulation B, \u00a7 1002.14(c), currently includes a residential structure \u201cwhether or not  * * * attached to real property,\u201d and lists as an example a \u201cmobile or other manufactured home.\u201d Industry commenters reported that a significant number of consumers in the United States reside in manufactured homes. The Bureau does not believe the comments articulate a valid basis for a new exemption under Regulation B for manufactured homes that would otherwise meet the definition of \u201cdwelling.\u201d Whether an applicant has a right to receive a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that has been performed should not turn on whether the residential structure is built on site or in a factory for later installation on site\u2014particularly when such valuations can be done for these transactions.\n            The definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d in Regulation B is appropriately broad enough to encompass manufactured homes. The Bureau recognizes, however, that transactions involving manufactured homes will not always result in appraisals or other written valuations. This issue is taken into account in \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3) discussed below.", 
                        "The final rule also provides clarification in response to comments by several industry trade associations that \u00a7 1002.14 should not apply to certain other structures, such as recreational vehicles or boats. Unlike manufactured homes, which are specifically enumerated examples of a \u201cdwelling\u201d in existing \u00a7 1002.14(c) and proposed \u00a7 1002.14(b)(2),\n\n            other structures such as boats and recreational vehicles are not enumerated as examples. Though boats and recreational vehicles may have residential uses in some cases, the fact that they are not expressly enumerated here in existing Regulation B suggests that, unlike manufactured homes, they are not exclusively residential by nature and are not always covered by the existing appraisal copy requirements at \u00a7 1002.14. Therefore, while the Bureau does not see a basis for removing \u201cmanufactured homes\u201d from the list of enumerated examples of a dwelling in \u00a7 1002.14 (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> existing &#167;&#167; 1002.14(c) and 1002.13(a)(2)), there is a basis for analyzing boats and recreational vehicles differently.", 
                        "In addition, even though Regulation Z commentary has long stated that boats and trailers can be dwellings and has not ruled out that recreational vehicles and campers also could be dwellings,\n\n            they are not covered by the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule under TILA section 129H. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Regulation Z, &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(iii). As noted above, the rules implementing ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H allow for identical consumer disclosure concerning appraisals and require creditors to provide copies of appraisals to applicants. To the extent regulations implementing ECOA section 701(e) and TILA section 129H can be aligned, burden on creditors is reduced.", 
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(2)-1 to confirm that the requirements of \u00a7 1002.14 in particular do not apply to transactions secured solely by motor vehicles as defined by 12 U.S.C. 5519(f)(1)\u2014a term that includes boats, motor homes, recreational vehicles, and other vehicles, but not manufactured homes.\n            It is not clear that in amending section 701(e) of ECOA in the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress intended to provide a basis for requiring creditors to provide copies of valuations when selling motor vehicles used as residences. The legislative history for section 701(e) specifically refers to providing protections for \u201cmortgage applicants,\u201d for example.\n            ECOA section 701(e)(6) also lists examples of \u201cvaluations\u201d that are used in the real estate context\u2014broker price opinions, GSE values, and AVMs (a term which section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act defined within the context of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), a statute focused on \u201creal estate related transactions\u201d, 12 U.S.C. 3331). To the extent any motor vehicle transactions otherwise could be subject to \u00a7 1002.14, the Bureau exercises its exception authority under ECOA section 703(a) to exclude them. As noted above, because the legislative history does not clearly suggest an intent to cover motor vehicle transactions, the exclusion will facilitate compliance by reducing regulatory uncertainty, and will be consistent with the purposes of section 701(e) of ECOA as reflected in the legislative history described above.", 
                        "The Bureau did not, however, seek comment in the proposal on whether structures that are \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d can be covered by or should be excluded from the scope of ECOA and Regulation B more broadly, including the information collection requirements of \u00a7 1002.13. This clarification in comment 14(b)(2)-1 is therefore limited to \u00a7 1002.14 and is not a pronouncement on whether boats, trailers, recreational vehicles, campers, or motor vehicles would otherwise fall within the definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d in other provisions of Regulation B."

One industry commenter also was unsure whether a document integrating multiple publicly-available valuations would itself be a valuation.

                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Discussion.</em> The Bureau is finalizing the definition of valuation in &#167; 1002.14(b)(3) as proposed, with one technical change. In the proposal, the phrases &#8220;developed in connection with an application for credit&#8221; in the description of the requirement in &#167; 1002.14(a)(1) regarding the materials that must be provided, and the phrase &#8220;developed in connection with a creditor's decision to provide credit&#8221; in the definition of valuation in &#167; 1002.14(b)(3), were taken directly from the text of ECOA sections 701(e)(1) and (6) respectively. The Bureau does not believe that Congress intended these phrases to have different meanings. As a practical matter, many appraisals or other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit will be a valuation developed in connection with a creditor's decision to provide credit and vice versa. However, using different terms in the rule could suggest there may be circumstances in which a valuation falls into one category, but not another. To facilitate compliance by eliminating uncertainty and to ensure the final rule gives full effect to section 701(e)(1), which is controlling as to the materials that must be provided to applicants, the Bureau interprets section 701(e)(6) consistently with 701(e)(1), and to the extent necessary is exercising its authority under ECOA section 703(a), to use the phrase &#8220;developed in connection with an application for credit&#8221; in the definition of &#8220;valuation&#8221; in &#167; 1002.14(b)(3).", 
                        "The final rule also makes a number of clarifying revisions to the commentary. As noted earlier, comment 14(a)(1)-7 is being added to the final rule to clarify that drafts or other non-final materials need not be provided if they have been superseded by later versions. In addition, as discussed below, the final rule incorporates several revisions to proposed comment 14(b)(3)-1 and proposed comment 14(b)(3)-2 (which is renumbered as comment 14(b)(3)-3), and adds a new comment 14(b)(3)-2. These revisions address certain additional concerns of commenters regarding the materials that must be provided to applicants.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The list of examples of valuations in comment 14(b)(3)-1 has been revised to eliminate the phrase \u201cwritten comments and other documents submitted to the creditor in support of\u201d the estimate. The Bureau believes that the list of materials that must be provided will be easier for creditors to understand if it refers simply to the reports themselves. The Bureau notes that this phrase (\u201cwritten comments and other documents\u201d) is not explicitly provided for in the definition of \u201cvaluation\u201d in ECOA section 701(e)(6), and a number of commenters suggested that the phrase may be susceptible to uncertainty that could lead to overburdening creditors and consumers with the disclosure of information that is background in nature. The Bureau further notes that, in the absence of a definition of \u201cappraisal\u201d within ECOA, a 1993 amendment to the definition of an appraisal report in the commentary to Regulation B (58 FR 65658, 65659) had included this phrase \u201cwritten comments and other documents.\u201d In light of the inclusion in section 701(e) of ECOA of a definition of \u201cvaluation\u201d that is broad enough to include appraisal reports, and the comments received, the Bureau does not believe a general reference to ancillary and supplementary information is useful to include in the list. Instead, the Bureau has added comment 14(b)(3)-2 in the final rule to clarify that the term \u201cvaluation\u201d includes any attachments or exhibits that are part of an integrated valuation report. The Bureau believes that this comment is clearer, more specific, and addresses the commenters' concerns over uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase \u201cwritten comments and other documents.\u201d Under this comment in the final rule, for example, if a creditor receives an AVM report that has a list of comparable properties included as an exhibit or an attachment, then a copy of this exhibit or attachment would need to be provided. This comment therefore should ensure that consumers receive a copy of the complete, integrated report, without being distracted or burdened by additional ancillary information that falls outside the four corners of the report. Comment 14(b)(3)-1 also clarifies, however, that the list of examples is not exhaustive. Ultimately, the definition of \u201cvaluation\u201d in \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3) governs.", 
                        "For clarity and consistency across the examples in the final rule, the Bureau has revised the second proposed example to make clear that an internal creditor valuation must be disclosed, regardless of whether a third-party appraisal report is prepared. As a result of this change, the third proposed example\u2014internal review documents reflecting the creditor valuation\u2014was removed as largely duplicative. This deletion also addresses industry commenters' concerns that internal review documents, such as quality checks, fraud checks, automated underwriting determinations that do not estimate the value of the dwelling (such as certain GSE tools that simply suggest another valuation is excessive), or expressions of criticism of a valuation, should not be treated as themselves being valuations.", 
                        "In response to GSE comments that they do not \u201crequire\u201d use of their valuation methods, the Bureau has revised the example relating to GSE valuations to delete the word \u201crequired\u201d, which also is not used in the statute. The statute simply refers to values developed \u201cpursuant to a policy of a government sponsored enterprise.\u201d To provide additional guidance, this example in the comment now refers to GSE-approved forms for disclosing to consumers values developed pursuant to proprietary GSE mechanisms and methodologies.\n            This revision also should help to clarify the type of GSE automated tools whose output would be considered valuations.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing inclusion of valuations developed by AVMs in the list of examples because they are included in the statutory list of valuation types in section 701(e)(6). The Bureau does not believe that the potential for AVM valuations to be coded or difficult for some consumers to understand is a basis for excluding them from the disclosure requirement. Consistent with the purpose of ECOA section 701(e) and ECOA more broadly, if an AVM develops a valuation in connection with the application that is provided to the creditor, then the creditor has a duty under the final rule to disclose a copy to the applicant. While some AVMs may use proprietary methods, the final rule does not require the disclosure of these methods <em data-original=\"E-03\">per se;</em> rather, the final rule requires disclosure of the written valuations developed by the AVMs which are provided to the creditors.\n            That is, the revised list of examples focuses on the report generated by the AVM to estimate the property's value, as opposed to the AVM methodology itself. Because AVM providers have control over such output, it should be within their control to ensure such output does not reveal proprietary information. Similarly, to the extent AVM reports are complex and coded, and creditors wish to voluntarily educate consumers, the creditors may provide additional explanatory information to the applicant at the time the AVM report is provided or request that the AVM generate such information. The rule does not require that creditors do so, however.", 
                        "The Bureau also does not believe it would be appropriate to define the term \u201cautomated valuation model\u201d in comment 14(b)(3)-1. When in receipt of a particular computer-generated report that may provide an estimate of the value of the dwelling, the creditor ultimately must make its own judgment of whether that report meets the definition of valuation in \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3). The final rule cannot foresee all the types of computer-generated reports that might include valuations. Moreover, comment 14(b)(3)-1 is merely intended as a list of examples of valuations. In addition, section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends a different statute\u2014FIRREA\u2014to define the term \u201cautomated valuation model\u201d for purposes of that statute as \u201cany computerized model\u201d used to determine the value of a dwelling that secures a mortgage. That definition would be implemented by a separate inter-agency rulemaking.", 
                        "Further, the Bureau does not believe that changes to the text of the regulation or commentary are needed to address the appraisal industry comments on the references to appraisers \u201cwhether or not licensed or certified\u201d and to broker price opinions in the list of examples of valuations. The final rule does not regulate, or purport to regulate, the use of valuations such as broker price opinions by creditors. By referring to an example of a valuation, the final rule also does not suggest such a valuation would be permitted in any specific transaction, or that the person preparing such a valuation would be qualified.", 
                        "The list of examples that do not qualify as valuations, finalized in comment 14(b)(3)-3, is revised to refer to a manufacturer's invoice for a \u201cmanufactured home\u201d instead of a \u201cmobile home,\u201d consistent with the comment indicating that the term \u201cmanufactured home\u201d is current industry usage.\n            Removing the reference to \u201cmobile home\u201d in this example also aligns with the exclusion of motor vehicles from the scope of the final rule.", 
                        "The Bureau has considered the observations from manufactured housing industry commenters that data from the manufacturers' invoice for manufactured homes is sometimes included as a factor in the lender's calculation of the loan amount or maximum loan amount. For example, two industry commenters pointed to HUD Title I insurance underwriting criteria, under which the maximum Title I insurable loan amount for manufactured housing loans for new homes is based, in part, upon the manufacturer invoice amount. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> HUD, TI-481, App. 2 at 3-4 (Apr. 2009). The comments did not provide information that would clearly establish a basis for categorically determining that loan amounts, maximum loan amounts, or loan-to-value calculations are not valuations under the final rule, however. These creditor calculations, if they would otherwise be valuations, would not lose such status merely by taking into account manufacturer invoice information. Indeed, the comments did not provide a rationale for why an applicant should be barred from viewing a valuation that contains manufacturer invoice data, if the creditor has received information from that invoice and used it in a valuation.", 
                        "The list of examples that would not be covered by the rule also is revised to clarify that property inspection reports are not valuations, if they do not provide an estimate or opinion of the property's value and are not used in the development of such an estimate or opinion. This example is added to address several comments seeking clarification about a variety of property reports that may be provided in the underwriting process.", 
                        "Finally, the comment clarifies that the list is not exhaustive. Again, the definition of \u201cvaluation\u201d in \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3) governs. This serves to emphasize that the commentary cannot exhaustively catalog all of the types of documents that might or might not fit the definition of \u201cvaluation.\u201d The final rule seeks to address those comments the Bureau believes point to the most common types of documents that may raise the most significant questions under the final rule."
