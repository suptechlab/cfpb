    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation Z to implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The final rule implements requirements and restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act concerning loan originator compensation; qualifications of, and registration or licensing of loan originators; compliance procedures for depository institutions; mandatory arbitration; and the financing of single- premium credit insurance. The final rule revises or provides additional commentary on Regulation Z's restrictions on loan originator compensation, including application of these restrictions to prohibitions on dual compensation and compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction, and to recordkeeping requirements. The final rule also establishes tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits-based compensation arrangements. At this time, the Bureau is not prohibiting payments to and receipt of payments by loan originators when a consumer pays upfront points or fees in the mortgage transaction. Instead the Bureau will first study how points and fees function in the market and the impact of this and other mortgage-related rulemakings on consumers' understanding of and choices with respect to points and fees. This final rule is designed primarily to protect consumers by reducing incentives for loan originators to steer consumers into loans with particular terms and by ensuring that loan originators are adequately qualified.",

Thus, for example, if an individual loan originator employed by a bank originates a loan, the names and NMLSR IDs of the individual and the bank must be included on covered loan documents. The NMLSR ID is a number generally assigned by the NMLSR to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan origination services. For more information, see the SAFE Act sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its implementing regulations (12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)).

For example, certain loan originator organizations and individual loan originators who are employees of bona fide nonprofit organizations may not be required to obtain a unique identifier under State law. However, some loan originators may have obtained NMLSR IDs, even if they are not required to have one for their current jobs.

The main MHA components are the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a Treasury program that uses TARP funds to provide incentives for mortgage servicers to modify eligible first-lien mortgages, and two initiatives at the GSEs that use non-TARP funds. Incentive payments for modifications to loans owned or guaranteed by the GSEs are paid by the GSEs, not TARP. Treasury over time expanded MHA to include sub-programs designed to overcome obstacles to sustainable HAMP modifications. Treasury also allocated TARP funds to support two additional housing support efforts: an FHA refinancing program and TARP funding for 19 state housing finance agencies, called the Housing Finance Agency Hardest Hit Fund. In the first half of 2012, Treasury extended the application period for HAMP by a year to December 31, 2013, and opened HAMP to non-owner-occupied rental properties and to consumers with a wider range of debt-to-income ratios under \u201cHAMP Tier 2.\u201d",

Each of these data sources was not necessarily relevant to each of the rulemakings. The Bureau used the additional data from NMLS and NMLS Mortgage Call Report data to better corroborate its estimate of the contours of the non-depository segment of the mortgage market. The Bureau has received loan file extracts from three lenders, but at this point, the data from one lender is not usable and the data from the other two is not sufficiently standardized nor representative to inform consideration of the final rules. Additionally, the Bureau has thus far not yet received data from the National Mortgage Database pilot phases. The Bureau also requested that commenters submit relevant data. All probative data submitted by commenters are discussed in this document.",

        "162": "Consumers who expect to pay the balance of their loan prior to maturity can purchase from creditors the sole right to choose the date of this payoff. This right is valuable and its price is the market value such a sale creates for creditors in regard to the date of this potential payoff. Creditors exchange rights with consumers but in the opposite direction with \u201ccallable\u201d bonds. This type of bond exhibits an exactly opposite trade, in which the borrower cedes to the creditor the choice of time at which the creditor can require, if it chooses, the borrower to remit the remaining value of the bond.", 
        "163": "The two options are not mutually exclusive. In some transactions, consumers may pay for the embedded option through more than one of the methods outlined. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> Donald Keenan &amp; James J Kau, <em data-original=\"E-03\">An Overview of the Option-Theoretic Pricing of Mortgages,</em> 6 Journal of Housing Research 217 (1995) (providing an overview of options embedded in residential mortgages); James J Kau, Donald Keenan, Walter Muller &amp; James Epperson, <em data-original=\"E-03\">A Generalized Valuation Model for Fixed-Rate Mortgages with Default and Prepayment,</em> 11 Journal of Real Estate Finance &amp; Economics 5 (1995) (providing a traditional method to value these options numerically); Robert R.

        "164": "Similarly, consumers who expect to pay their loans over a period sufficiently short as to make the purchase of discount loans unattractive may find it better at the end of this expected period to continue to pay their mortgage and, consequently, suffer an unanticipated loss from refraining from the purchase of points. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Yan Chang &amp; Abdullah Yavas, <em data-original=\"E-03\">Do Borrowers Make Rational Choices on Points and Refinancing?,</em> 37 Real Estate Economics 635 (2009) (offering empirical evidence that consumers in their sample data remain in their current fixed-rate mortgages for too short a time to recover their initial investment in discount points). Other empirical evidence, however, conflicts with these results in regard to both the frequency and magnitude of losses. Simple numerical calculations that take into account taxes, local volatility in property values, and returns on alternative assets highlight the difficulty in drawing conclusions from much of the empirical data.", 
        "165": "Such a circumstance includes, for example, the case in which the need to understand and decide among loans with different points and fees combinations imposes a burden on some consumers. The existence of increased choice made available by this provision would, in this case, be itself a cost to the consumer. Based on standard economic reasoning, the Bureau believes, however, that the circumstances in which the exercise of its exemption authority has the potential to reduce consumer welfare, relative to the statutory prohibition, are, for the most part, quite rare.", 
        "166": "The choice over the means by which consumers compensate creditors for the prepayment option is of particular potential benefit to consumers who currently enjoy high liquidity but who either face prospects of diminished liquidity in the future or are more sensitive to the risk posed by a high variance in their future income or wealth. Examples of such consumers include retiring or older individuals wishing to secure their future housing, individuals who are otherwise predisposed to use their wealth for a one-time payment, consumers with relocation funds available, and consumers offered certain rebates by developers or other sellers. In situations where consumers are unaware of their own circumstance or their own relative financial acuity, some creditors may be able to benefit. For example, an unethical creditor may persuade those consumers unaware of their lower relative financial ability to make incorrect decisions regarding purchasing points. The outcome of this type of adverse selection will be reversed when consumers have a more accurate knowledge of their financial abilities than does the creditor.", 
        "167": "Conversely, the elimination of the option to pay upfront points and fees could, depending on the extant risk in creditors' portfolios and their perceptions of differential risk between neighborhoods, seriously reduce the access to mortgage credit for some consumers.", 
        "168": "In contrast, the prohibition on payment of upfront points and fees in the Dodd-Frank Act under most circumstances would ensure that the value of the option to share risk through discount points is lost to both the creditor and the consumer in those circumstances. Absent other means of hedging prepayment risk, creditors would either need to reduce the volume of loans they originate or incur greater costs of raising capital to fund such loans, owing to the increased risk to their business and, consequently, to their solvency.", 
        "169": "Credible signaling in such a situation, from the creditor's perspective, distinguishes two groups of consumers\u2014one with low prepayment risk who purchase discount points, and the second a group not purchasing discount points and, consequently, expect to prepay their loan more rapidly than average\u2014in what would otherwise be a pool of consumers who are perceived by the creditor to exhibit an equivalent measure of prepayment risk.", 
        "17": "The Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage. HARP is designed for those homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments but have been unable to get traditional refinancing because the value of their homes has declined. For a mortgage to be considered for a HARP refinance, it <em data-original=\"E-03\">must</em> be owned or guaranteed by the GSEs. HARP ends on December 31, 2013.", 
        "170": "In this situation where the efficiency of the market is only impaired by adverse selection, this increase in creditor returns is independent of whether the creditor sells loans in the secondary market or chooses to engage in hedging to hold these mortgages in portfolio.", 
        "171": "Moral hazard, in the current context of mortgage origination, depends fundamentally on the advantage the loan originator has in knowing the least expensive transaction terms acceptable to creditors and greater overall knowledge of the functioning of mortgage markets. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Holden Lewis, <em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Moral Hazard&#8221; Helps Shape Mortgage Mess,</em> Bankrate (Apr. 18, 2007), <em data-original=\"E-03\">available at</em>\n              <em data-original=\"E-03\">http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/mortgages/20070418_subprime_mortgage_morality_a1.asp</em> (providing a practitioner description of the costs of such moral hazard on the current mortgage and housing industries).",

        "173": "As noted in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau issued CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 in response to the questions it received regarding the applicability of the current regulation to designated plans and non-designated plans, and this regulation is intended in part to provide further clarity on such issues. Until the final rule goes into effect, the clarifications in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 will remain in effect.",

        "176": "When multiple originators are working for a given loan originator organization or creditor, the compensation to each individual loan originator will depend upon on the aggregate efforts of all the loan originators working for this entity, rather than directly on the individual loan originator's own performance. Consequently, if we compare the efforts of an individual loan originator working for a smaller entity with those of another individual at a larger entity, the effort by the individual at the larger entity will be less than the effort of the individual at the smaller entity, owing to the smaller influence any individual at the larger entity has on the amount of compensation awarded to the individual. This relationship between individual effort and the total number of peers in a given entity is termed \u201cfree-riding.\u201d Free riding behavior has been extensively analyzed: Surveys of these analyses appear in Martin L. Weitzman, <em data-original=\"E-03\">Incentive Effects of Profit Sharing, in Trends in Business Organization: Do Participation and Cooperation Increase Competitiveness?</em> (Kiel Inst. of World Econs.1995), <em data-original=\"E-03\">available at</em>\n              <em data-original=\"E-03\">http://ws1.ad.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/IncentiveEffectsProfitSharing.pdf.</em> ;", 
        "177": "Economic research has established the general principle that the amount of work individuals put into a given task, in response to remuneration based on the sharing of profits, declines as the number of their peers increases (\u201cfree-riding.\u201d). No principle with such generality has been shown, however, in regard to the rate of this decline and the amount of individual work effort for any particular group of employees. Features of the means by which profits are distributed to individuals and the individual's environment within a given firm, such as the individual's ability to observe the performance of his peers and the frequency of managerial monitoring of individual performance, strongly affect these variables, as shown in a number of recent studies, including empirical and experimental research papers: Susan Helper, et al., <em data-original=\"E-03\">Analyzing Compensation Methods in Manufacturing: Piece Rates, Time Rates, or Gain-Sharing?,</em> (NBER Working Paper No. 16540, 2010); R.

The proposal explained that having the loan originator's name may help consumers understand that they have the opportunity to assess the risks associated with a particular loan originator in connection with the transaction, which in turn promotes the informed use of credit. The Bureau explained that it believed that this was consistent with TILA section 105(a)'s provision for additional requirements that are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA or to facilitate compliance with TILA. These provisions also clarified, consistent with the statutory requirement that mortgage originators include \u201cany\u201d NMLSR ID, that the requirement applies if the organization or individual loan originator has ever been issued an NMLSR ID. For example, an individual loan originator who works for a bona fide nonprofit organization is not required to obtain an NMLSR ID, but if the individual was issued an NMLSR ID for purposes of a previous job, that NMLSR ID must be included. Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(g)(1) also provided that the name and NMLSR IDs must be included each time any of these documents is provided to a consumer or presented to a consumer for signature.",

Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(g)(1)(ii), recognizing that there may be transactions in which more than one individual meets the definition of a loan originator, provided that the individual loan originator whose NMLSR ID must be included is the individual with primary responsibility for the transaction at the time the loan document is issued.",

To ensure harmonization between the two rules, proposed comment 36(g)(1)(ii)-1 stated that, if more than one individual acts as a loan originator for the transaction, the requirement in \u00a7 1026.36(g)(1)(ii) may be met by complying with the applicable provision governing disclosure of NMLSR IDs in rules issued by the Bureau pursuant to Dodd-Frank Act sections 1032(f), 1098, and 1100A.", 
                        "Commenters generally supported the proposed provision as a way to increase accountability. One commenter urged the Bureau to change the format of NMLSR IDs to allow consumers to determine whether the loan originator is licensed or registered because the commenter was concerned that a consumer might incorrectly assume that all loan originators are licensed. Several commenters asked for more clarity on how to determine which loan originator has primary responsibility for a transaction and has to include his or her name and NMLSR ID on a document. Commenters stated that the loan originator with primary responsibility should be, variously, the person who took a consumer's application, the person whose name appears on the loan application under Federal Housing Finance Agency requirements, the person who is the consumer's point of contact, or the person reasonably determined by the loan originator organization. One commenter asked for clarification that the names and NMLSR IDs must appear only once on each loan document rather than on every page of the loan document. Another commenter urged the Bureau to standardize exactly where on each loan document the names and NMLSR IDs must appear. Another commenter asked the Bureau to confirm that if the loan originator with primary responsibility for a transaction changes during the course of the transaction, issued loan documents do not have to be reissued merely to change the name and NMLSR on those documents.", 
                        "In response to commenters' requests for more specificity on how to determine which individual loan originator has primary responsibility, the Bureau is clarifying in comment 36(g)(1)(ii)-1 that a loan originator organization that establishes and follows a reasonable, written policy for determining which individual loan originator has primary responsibility for the transaction at the time the document is issued complies with the requirement. The Bureau notes that, as further discussed below, the final rule requires in \u00a7 1026.36(j) that depository institutions must establish and maintain procedures for complying with \u00a7 1026.36(d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, including the requirement to include names and NMLSR IDs on loan documents. The Bureau is also clarifying in comment 36(g)(1)-2 that, even if the loan originator does not have an NMLSR ID, the loan originator must still include his or her name on the covered loan documents.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees with the comment urging that the names and NMLSR IDs should be required to appear only once on each loan document rather than on each page of a loan document. New comment 36(g)(1)-3 includes this clarification. The Bureau does not agree that it should mandate exactly where the names and NMLSR IDs must appear on the credit application, note, and security instrument. Doing so would be impractical because State and local law may specify placement of items on documents that are to be recorded, such as the note and security instrument, and revising the format of the most commonly used credit application forms would implicate other rules beyond the scope of this rulemaking.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau agrees that, if the loan originator with primary responsibility for a transaction changes during the course of the transaction, previously issued loan documents do not have to be reissued merely to change the names and NMLSR IDs on those documents. This clarification is included in comment 36(g)(1)(ii)-1."

Proposed comment 36(g)(2)-1 clarified that the name and NMLSR ID must be included on any amendment, rider, or addendum to the note or loan contract or security instrument. These clarifications were provided in response to concerns that Small Entity Representatives expressed in the Small Business Review Panel that the statutory reference to \u201call loan documents\u201d would lead to uncertainty as to what is or is not considered a \u201cloan document.\u201d The proposed scope of the requirement's coverage was intended to ensure that loan originators' names and NMLSR IDs are included on documents that include the terms or prospective terms of the transaction or borrower information that the loan originator may use to identify loan terms that are potentially available or appropriate for the consumer. To the extent that any document not listed in \u00a7 1026.36(g)(2) is arguably a \u201cloan document,\u201d the Bureau stated that it was specifying an exhaustive list of loan documents that must include loan originators' names and NMLSR IDs using its authority under TILA section 105(a), which allows the Bureau to make exceptions that are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA or to facilitate compliance with TILA.",

As a result, the requirement to include the name and NMLSR ID would apply to the current RESPA GFE and settlement statement and TILA disclosure until the issuance of the integrated disclosures. The Bureau recognized that such a sequence of events might cause loan originator organizations to have to incur the cost of adjusting their systems and procedures to accommodate the name and NMLSR IDs on the current disclosures even though those disclosures will be replaced in the future by the integrated disclosures. Accordingly, the Bureau solicited public comment on whether the effective date of the provisions regarding inclusion of the NMLSR IDs on the RESPA and TILA disclosures should be delayed until the date that the integrated disclosures are issued.",

Another commenter stated that the NMLSR should be required only on the application, note, and security instrument. One commenter stated that the names and NMLSR IDs should not be required on amendments, riders, or addenda to the note or security instruments because the note and security instrument will already have the names and NMLSR IDs on them. Several commenters urged the Bureau not to require the names and NMLSR IDs on the current RESPA GFE and settlement statement because those forms do not currently have space for the information and will be discontinued soon. For the same reason, several commenters urged the Bureau to delay the effective date of the provision until after the integrated forms and regulations are issued and effective.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees that the loan originator names and NMLSR IDs should not be required to be included on the current RESPA GFE and HUD-1 (or HUD-1A) forms. The current RESPA GFE form has a designated space for the originator's name but not for the NMLSR ID. The current HUD-1 form (and HUD-1A form) has a designated space for the lender's name, but not for the originator's name and NMLSR ID. While the Bureau has no objection to loan originator names and NMLSR IDs being included on the current forms where not required, the Bureau believes it would be duplicative and unnecessarily expensive for the issuers of these forms to have to revise their systems only to have to revise them again once the Bureau implements its 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal. For this reason, the Bureau is generally implementing all Title XIV disclosure requirements to take effect at the same time.", 
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau expects to adopt the requirement to include loan originator names and NMLSR IDs on the integrated disclosures at the same time that the rules implementing the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal are adopted. The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.36(g)(2) with \u00a7 1026.36(g)(2)(ii), reserved in this final rule. The Bureau expects to adopt references to the integrated disclosures in \u00a7 1026.36(g)(2)(ii) in the final rule implementing the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal. In response to the commenter's concern that the loan originator names and NMLSR IDs should not be required to be included on preprinted booklets, the final rule, like the proposal, does not require inclusion on the booklets. The revisions to \u00a7 1026.36(g)(2) described above are expected to prevent any such misinterpretation.", 
                        "The Bureau disagrees that the loan originator names and NMLSR IDs should be required only on the application, note, and security instrument. To promote accountability of loan originators throughout the course of the transaction, it is important for the names and NMLSR IDs to appear on the integrated loan estimate and closing disclosure as well, because these loan documents include the loan terms offered or negotiated by loan originators. However, as clarified above, the names and NMLSR IDs will not be required to be included on these additional loan documents until the use of those documents becomes mandatory under the Bureau's upcoming final rule on TILA-RESPA Integration.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees with the commenter that the loan originator names and NMLSR IDs should not be required on amendments, riders, or addenda to the note or security instruments, as such documents will be attached the note or security instrument, which themselves are required to include the names and NMLSR IDs. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 36(g)(2)-1. Removal of this requirement is consistent with the Bureau's clarification in comment 36(g)(1)-3 that for any loan document, the names and NMLSR IDs are required to be included only one time, and not on each page."

The prohibition applies to credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment, credit property insurance, and other similar products. The same provision states, however, that the prohibition does not apply to credit insurance for which premiums or fees are calculated and paid in full on a monthly basis or to credit unemployment insurance for which the premiums are reasonable, the creditor receives no compensation, and the premiums are paid pursuant to a separate insurance contract and are not paid to the creditor's affiliate.",

The authority to implement these statutory provisions by rule is TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Rather than repeating Dodd-Frank Act section 1414's list of covered credit insurance products, the proposed language cross-referenced the existing description of insurance products in \u00a7 1026.4(d)(1) and (3).

The proposal stated the Bureau's belief that these provisions are sufficiently straightforward that they require no further clarification. The Bureau requested comment, however, on whether any issues raised by the provision require clarification and, if so, how they should be clarified. The Bureau also solicited comment on when the provision should become effective, for example, 30 days following publication of the final rule, or at a later time.",

The Bureau agrees with the commenters who stated that the provision is an important consumer protection that should not be delayed without good reason. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provision by regulation does not require it to delay the provision's effective date for a long period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of this important protection within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period of time because the prohibition, which is not substantially changed by this final rule, has been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted and the codified regulation will not require extensive calibration of origination systems. Furthermore, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have prohibited the same practice for years.\n            The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, because industry may need to make some adjustments based on the clarifications made in this final rule.",

As revised, the final rule provides that the listed types of insurance are what insurance \u201cmeans,\u201d not just what it \u201cincludes,\u201d because the list provided in the statute seems to be exclusive. The Bureau declines to define at this time what insurance premiums are \u201creasonable\u201d for purposes of the exception for certain credit unemployment insurance products because the Bureau does not currently have sufficient data and other information to make this judgment for a rule of general applicability.",

Adding a monthly charge for the insurance to the loan balance would amount to financing the premiums for credit insurance rather than paying them in full on a monthly basis. Similarly, charging a fixed monthly charge for the credit insurance that does not decline as the loan balance declines would fail to meet the requirement for the premium to be \u201ccalculated * * * on a monthly basis.\u201d As a result, this practice would fail to satisfy the conditions for the exclusion from what constitutes \u201cfinanc[ing], directly or indirectly\u201d credit insurance premiums.",

Credit insurance generally insures a consumer in the event of a specified event, and the benefit provided is to make the consumer's periodic payments while the consumer is unable to make them. Mortgage insurance is distinguishable in that it insures a creditor (or its assignee) against loss in the event of default by the consumer or in other specified events."
