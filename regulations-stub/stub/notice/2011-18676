    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) is publishing for public comment an interim final rule establishing Regulation D (Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity) pursuant to the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA) and the Truth in Lending Act. The interim final rule is necessary to avoid a regulatory gap created by the amendments to AMTPA in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Without an interim final rule that takes immediate effect, state housing creditors would no longer be able to make variable rate mortgage loans and other alternative mortgage transactions pursuant to AMTPA in states that prohibit such transactions, thus denying consumers access to that form of credit. Until July 22, 2012, the interim final rule applies only to state housing creditors seeking to invoke federal preemption of state law under AMTPA. The interim final rule will be in place as a temporary measure pending the CFPB's completion of a notice-and-comment rulemaking to promulgate permanent rules, including rules governing alternative mortgage transactions made by federally chartered housing creditors. The CFPB seeks public comment in anticipation of that process.",

The purpose of AMTPA (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3801) is to provide parity between federal and state housing creditors \u201cby authorizing all housing creditors to make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the Federal agencies.\u201d However, as described above, the level of parity provided by AMTPA has been modified by the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to the definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d and the scope of preemption under AMTPA, which narrow the range of transactions eligible for AMTPA preemption and restore the effect of certain state mortgage laws.

This section further states that Part 1004 does not apply to a transaction if the creditor received the application for that transaction before July 22, 2011.", 
                        "Section 1083(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that its amendments to AMTPA do not affect \u201cany transaction covered by the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982 (12 U.S.C. 3801 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>) and entered into on or before the designated transfer date.&#8221; Accordingly, the CFPB must determine when a transaction is &#8220;entered into&#8221; for purposes of determining which preemption standards and rules&#8212;pre-Dodd-Frank Act amendments or post-Dodd-Frank Act amendments&#8212;are applicable. Rather than a single event, a mortgage transaction is a series of steps progressing from application to consummation to servicing. Each of these steps is subject to a variety of state and federal consumer protection statutes, many of which govern activities that occur prior to consummation (such as disclosure and underwriting). In order to establish a workable regulatory regime, there must be a readily identifiable date and a single set of rules to govern the entire transaction. In light of these considerations, the CFPB has interpreted an &#8220;alternative mortgage transaction&#8221; as being &#8220;entered into&#8221; on the date the application is received by the creditor. This interpretation seeks to ensure that the entire transaction is governed by a consistent set of rules. For example, if an application for a mortgage transaction is received on July 21, 2011, but is not completed on August 21, 2011, AMTPA preemption is determined under the regime in effect prior to the Dodd-Frank Act amendments. However, if the application is received on July 22, 2011, AMTPA preemption is determined under the regime established by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments and this interim final rule.", 
                        "Comment 1(c)-1 clarifies that, if an application for a transaction is received by a creditor prior to July 22, 2011, whether 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) preempts state law with respect to that transaction depends on whether: (1) The transaction was an alternative mortgage transaction as defined by the version of 12 U.S.C. 3802(1) in effect at the time of application; and (2) the state housing creditor complied with applicable federal regulations issued by the OCC, NCUA, or OTS/FHLBB in effect at the time of application.", 
                        "Comment 1(c)-2 clarifies that, if 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) or this interim final rule (as applicable) preempted state law at the time an application was received, certain subsequent actions with respect to that transaction are entitled to the same degree of preemption. This comment applies regardless of whether the application was received before, on, or after July 22, 2011. First, if state law was preempted at the time of application, state law is also preempted with respect to the subsequent consummation, completion, purchase, or enforcement of the transaction by a state housing creditor. This interpretation is consistent with 12 U.S.C. 3801(b) and 3803(a), which address state housing creditors' ability to \u201cmake, purchase, or enforce\u201d alternative mortgage transactions.", 
                        "Second, if state law was preempted at the time of application, state law is also preempted with respect to the subsequent modification, renewal, or extension of the transaction. The CFPB interprets such activity as constituting a continuation of the same \u201ctransaction\u201d for purposes of AMTPA. For instance, if a distressed borrower with a variable rate mortgage loan that is currently subject to preemption under AMTPA would be able to avoid foreclosure through a modification, the CFPB believes that AMTPA should continue to preempt state law that would otherwise prohibit the modification. However, if state law was preempted at the time of application and the transaction is later satisfied and replaced by another transaction (such as through a refinancing), the second transaction must independently meet the requirements for preemption in effect at the time the second transaction is made under 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) or this interim final rule (as applicable).", 
                        "This interpretation is generally similar to the statutory language that governed the transition period with regard to states that decided to opt-out of the statutory preemption regime when AMTPA was first enacted.\n            However, the interim final rule treats refinancings differently than modifications, extensions, and renewals because, as provided in 12 CFR 226.20, a refinancing constitutes a new transaction that satisfies and replaces an existing obligation. Under these circumstances, the CFPB believes that the new transaction should be evaluated independently with respect to AMTPA preemption. The CFPB seeks comment on these interpretations, particularly as to what types of modifications might otherwise be prohibited under state law and whether additional protections are needed with respect to modifications."

                        "Comment 2(a)-1 clarifies that home equity lines of credit and subordinate lien mortgages are alternative mortgage transactions as long as they meet the definition in \u00a7 1004.2(a). Comment 2(a)-2, discussed in more detail below, provides specific examples of transactions that are alternative mortgage transactions, while comment 2(a)-3 provides examples of transactions that are not alternative mortgage transactions.", 
                        "The first element of the definition of alternative mortgage transaction is derived from AMTPA as well as the definition of a \u201cdwelling\u201d in 12 CFR 226.2(a)(19). The second element of the definition requires that an alternative mortgage transaction involve an extension of consumer credit. AMTPA's findings indicate that Congress was concerned with the availability of housing credit to consumers.\n\n            In addition, AMTPA applies to transactions secured by <em data-original=\"E-03\">residential</em> real property or a <em data-original=\"E-03\">dwelling</em> (including stock allocated to a dwelling in a residential cooperative housing corporation or a residential manufactured home). While some consumers may use their residence as security for credit for non-consumer purposes (such as to finance a business), AMTPA's use of the terms &#8220;residential&#8221; property and &#8220;dwelling&#8221; indicate that it is intended to apply to alternative mortgage transactions involving consumer credit. In addition, requiring alternative mortgage transactions to be consumer credit aligns the AMTPA regulations with the CFPB's general scope of authority under TILA, which also serves as authority for this interim final rule. However, the CFPB seeks comment on this issue.", 
                        "The third element of the definition requires that the interest rate or finance charge for the transaction may be adjusted or renegotiated. As described above, Section 1083 narrows AMTPA's definition of an \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d so that it refers only to loans and credit sales \u201cin which the interest rate or finance charge may be adjusted or renegotiated, [as] described and defined by applicable regulation.\u201d As noted above, Section 1083 deletes language that specifically included within the definition of alternative mortgage transaction: (1) Fixed-rate balloon loans \u201cwhich implicitly permit[] rate adjustments\u201d because the debt matures before the end of the loan's amortization schedule; and (2) mortgage loans \u201cinvolving any similar type of rate, method of determining return, term, repayment, or other variation not common to traditional fixed rate, fixed term transactions,\u201d including but not limited to shared equity and shared appreciation transactions.", 
                        "The interim final rule construes the amendment to exclude only those mortgages that do not involve an adjustable or renegotiable rate or finance charge. For example, a fixed-rate loan that permits the consumer to make interest-only payments for a period of time does not involve an adjustment to or renegotiation of the interest rate or finance charge. Previously, such transactions were considered alternative mortgage transactions under the third prong of the original AMTPA definition since an interest-only feature was \u201cnot common to traditional fixed rate, fixed term transactions.\u201d\n\n            Under the interim final rule, however, such transactions are no longer alternative mortgage transactions. Yet transactions that are specifically mentioned in the second and third prongs of the original AMTPA definition, such as shared-equity/shared-appreciation transactions and renewable balloon-payment transactions (which involve renegotiation of or adjustments to the rate or finance charge), <em data-original=\"E-03\">do</em> continue to be alternative mortgage transactions under the interim final rule. Furthermore, under the interim final rule, a mortgage with <em data-original=\"E-03\">both</em> an adjustable or renegotiable rate or finance charge <em data-original=\"E-03\">and</em> one or more other &#8220;nontraditional&#8221; features continues to be an &#8220;alternative mortgage transaction.&#8221; (However, as discussed below with respect to &#167; 1004.3, the scope of AMTPA preemption has also been narrowed such that alternative mortgage transactions with certain nontraditional features like interest-only payments or negative amortization are subject to greater state regulation under the amended statute.)", 
                        "The CFPB recognizes that the amendments to AMTPA's definition could be interpreted differently. Specifically, by eliminating references to balloon payment loans and shared-equity/shared-appreciation mortgages, the amendment could be interpreted as excluding all such transactions from the definition of an alternative mortgage transaction. In addition, the amendment removed a provision that defined alternative mortgage transactions as loans with variations to the rate, method of determining return, term, repayment, or other variations not common to traditional fixed-rate, fixed-term transactions. However, rather than attempting to identify each and every type of loan that could potentially fall under the deleted portions of the definition, the CFPB believes that, for purposes of this interim final rule, the best approach is to focus on whether particular types of transactions fit within the remaining statutory definition.", 
                        "As discussed further below, the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to both the definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d and to the scope of preemption under AMTPA are subject to different interpretations and are interrelated. The CFPB seeks public comment about how best to effectuate congressional intent through implementing regulations that will protect consumers, promote parity, and be readily understandable and applicable by creditors, supervising agencies, and others.

For example, the definition includes loans in which the interest rate or finance charge may be adjusted after a period of time as specified and defined by the contract, for instance to provide a &#8220;timely payment discount rate&#8221; upon an anniversary of loan origination to borrowers who have made timely payments for a specified period of time.\n            (However, as discussed below with respect to &#167; 1004.3, generally applicable state laws governing late charges, including increases in the interest rate due to default, are no longer preempted by AMTPA.)", 
                        "The definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d in \u00a7 1004.2(a) includes \u201cvariable rate transactions\u201d as defined under Regulation Z for purposes of providing disclosures under 12 CFR 226.19(b).\n            The definition is also similar to the OCC's definition of \u201cadjustable rate mortgage\u201d under its AMTPA regulations.\n            \n          ", 
                        "With regard to shared appreciation and shared equity features in particular, although the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to AMTPA deleted the specific language referencing shared appreciation and shared equity mortgages, loans with these features continue to fall within the remaining definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d because they are mortgage transactions in which a finance charge is adjustable. Indeed, the CFPB notes that Regulation Z currently categorizes shared-equity/shared appreciation mortgages as variable-rate transactions.\n            Accordingly, consistent with that interpretation, the interim final rule includes such mortgages within the definition of alternative mortgage transaction.", 
                        "The CFPB seeks comment on whether the products discussed above should be considered alternative mortgage transactions and what other products in the current market have adjustable rates or finance charges. The CFPB in particular seeks comment on whether treating a mortgage that permits a rate adjustment upon default as an alternative mortgage transaction is an appropriate approach in light of the Dodd-Frank Act amendments that specifically preserve states' authority to regulate late charges.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Mortgages with renegotiable rates or finance charges.</em> The statute does not define what types of loans provide for the &#8220;renegotiat[ion]&#8221; of the interest rate or finance charge. The CFPB does not believe that Congress intended this language to apply to every transaction in which the interest rate or finance charge might theoretically be renegotiated. Such an interpretation could encompass almost any mortgage transaction. Instead, the CFPB believes it is appropriate to consider historical regulations and interpretations issued by the FHLBB and by the Federal Reserve Board under Regulation Z, both of which suggest that &#8220;renegotiable rate mortgages&#8221; were commonly understood at the time that AMTPA was enacted to include a subset of fixed-rate balloon loans involving renewable short-term notes secured by long-term mortgages, where the creditor made a commitment to renew the notes but reserved discretion to adjust the interest rate at renewal.\n            \n          ", 
                        "This commitment to renew distinguishes renegotiable/renewable loans from a broader and more generic category of balloon loans that was included in AMTPA's original definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction,\u201d but was then removed from the definition by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments. That language referred to loans \u201cinvolving a fixed rate, but which implicitly permit[] rate adjustments by having the debt mature at the end of an interval shorter than the term of the amortization schedule,\u201d without reference or regard to renewal commitments.\n            \n          ", 
                        "As discussed above, the fact that Section 1083 deleted the reference to balloon loans while retaining the reference to loans for which the interest rate or finance charge may be renegotiated creates significant ambiguity as to how balloon loans should be treated under AMTPA as amended. However, based on available information, it is unclear to what the phrase \u201crenegotiable rate\u201d in the amended AMTPA definition refers, if not to balloon loans where there is a commitment to renew the loan but the rate is subject to renegotiation.", 
                        "For these reasons, the CFPB believes that, for purposes of this interim final rule, it is appropriate to construe the category of renegotiable rate loans to include fixed-rate balloon loans in which the lender has committed to renew the loan. For example, the interim final rule provides that, if a loan has, for instance, a 30-year amortization period but a balloon payment is due at the end of five years, the product is an \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d for purposes of AMTPA if the creditor commits to renew the mortgage.\n            The CFPB notes that the requirement of a lender commitment to renew can help protect borrowers from the heightened default risk associated with balloon payments.\n            Furthermore, as discussed below with respect to \u00a7 1004.4(b), this commitment must be made in writing in order for the transaction to receive AMTPA preemption.", 
                        "The CFPB seeks comment on all aspects of this issue, including comment on what products, if any, should be considered renegotiable rate loans, how commitments to renew are typically structured, and whether further clarity or protections may be appropriate for these mortgage products.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Adjustable or renegotiable rate loans with additional nontraditional features.</em> As noted above, the interim final rule defines &#8220;alternative mortgage transaction&#8221; by focusing on the language of the amended statutory definition&#8212;in other words, whether the loan has an adjustable or renegotiable rate or finance charge. It is unclear whether the deletion of AMTPA's language recognizing other nontraditional loan features such as negative amortization or interest-only payment periods was intended to exclude adjustable rate or renegotiable rate loans that also contain such features from AMTPA preemption. For purposes of the interim final rule, the CFPB has concluded that such loans should not be excluded, for several reasons.", 
                        "First, a broader exclusion based on the absence of statutory text would create a number of practical difficulties. The definitions removed from AMTPA mention two specific loan types\u2014balloon loans and shared-equity/shared-appreciation loans\u2014which can, in certain circumstances, be loans with adjustable or renegotiable rates or finance charges, as discussed above. While this amendment could be interpreted as having been intended to exclude these products from AMTPA coverage entirely, there is no specific language in the amended statute that provides guidance as to why such products would no longer be considered loans with adjustable or renegotiable rates or finance charges, regardless of the other aspects of the loan. In addition, the definitions removed by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments were quite broad and vague and overlap substantially with the other definitions.\n            Accordingly, interpreting the amendments to exclude from AMTPA coverage any transactions described in the removed definitions could undermine the remaining definition.", 
                        "Second, where unusual circumstances require publication of an interim rule to take immediate effect without advance notice and opportunity for comment, the CFPB believes that it is appropriate to minimize market disruption while the CFPB's notice-and-comment rulemaking is under way. Thus, it is appropriate to interpret the remaining definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d broadly.", 
                        "The CFPB also believes it is particularly important to consider the interaction between the Dodd-Frank Act's definitional changes (implemented in \u00a7 1004.2) and changes to the scope of preemption (implemented in \u00a7 1004.3). Under the definition adopted in the interim final rule, fixed-rate products involving negative amortization, interest-only periods, or graduated payment features do not meet the definition of \u201calternative mortgage transaction\u201d because they are not loans with adjustable or renegotiable rates or finance charges. Therefore, these types of loans are not eligible for federal preemption under AMTPA and instead are subject to applicable state law.", 
                        "In contrast, loans containing the same features that also have adjustable or renegotiable rates or finance charges <em data-original=\"E-03\">would</em> continue to qualify as &#8220;alternative mortgage transactions&#8221; under the definition in &#167; 1004.2(a). However, state law is preempted with respect to such loans only to the extent provided in &#167; 1004.3 (and only if the transaction also complies with the requirements in &#167; 1004.4(a) through (c), as applicable). Thus, to the extent that a state has enacted a law regulating, for example, negative amortization or interest-only features, AMTPA would not preempt application of that law to an alternative mortgage transaction.", 
                        "In addition, although the alternative mortgage transaction <em data-original=\"E-03\">definition</em> includes loans in which the contract permits the creditor to adjust the interest rate or finance charge upon default, applicable state laws governing late charges are not preempted under &#167; 1004.3. Accordingly, like the statute, the two parts of the interim final rule work in conjunction with each other to provide for more consistent application of state law across similar mortgage products.", 
                        "The CFPB seeks comment not just about the specific definitional changes but also how those changes relate to the new scope of preemption as further discussed below."

                "Section 1004.3 provides that a state housing creditor may make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 1004.4(a) through (c) (as applicable), notwithstanding any provision of State law that restricts the ability of the housing creditor to adjust or renegotiate an interest rate or finance charge with respect to the transaction or to change the amount of interest or finance charges included in a regular periodic payment as a result of such an adjustment or renegotiation. This regulation generally tracks the language and structure of 12 U.S.C. 3803, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. However, in order to implement the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to AMTPA, \u00a7 1004.3 interprets and clarifies the amended preemption standard in 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) in several respects.", 
                "As an initial matter, the amendments to 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) narrowed the scope of preemption to apply only to state laws that \u201c <em data-original=\"E-03\">prohibit</em> [] an alternative mortgage transaction.&#8221;\n            Although it is unclear from the statutory text what types of state laws prohibit alternative mortgage transactions for purposes of AMTPA, the amendments to 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) clarify that an alternative mortgage transaction is not prohibited by a state law that &#8220;regulates mortgage transactions generally, including any restriction on prepayment penalties or late charges.&#8221;\n            \n          ", 
                "Neither AMTPA nor the Dodd-Frank Act specifically define the term \u201cprohibit.\u201d However, that term is generally understood to mean forbid by law or to otherwise prevent or hinder an activity.\n            Furthermore, the purpose of AMTPA remains providing state housing creditors \u201cwith parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with [federal] regulations. * * * \u201d\n            This purpose would be thwarted if AMTPA were interpreted not to preempt state laws imposing restrictions on state housing creditors' ability to adjust interest rates and finance charges where such restrictions do not apply to federal housing creditors, as the ability to make such adjustments is integral to alternative mortgage transactions. Accordingly, because 12 U.S.C. 3802(1) defines an alternative mortgage transaction as a transaction \u201cin which the interest rate or finance charge may be adjusted or renegotiated,\u201d the interim final rule construes \u201cprohibit\u201d to include not only state laws banning the making, purchase, or enforcement of alternative mortgage transactions, but also state laws that restrict or hinder the adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate or finance charge. For example, as explained in comment 2, state laws are preempted to the extent that they restrict the circumstances under which a rate may be adjusted, the method by which a rate may be adjusted, or the amount of a rate adjustment.", 
                "Similarly, \u00a7 1004.3 provides that state laws are preempted with respect to alternative mortgage transactions to the extent that they restrict the ability of a state housing creditor to change the amount of a payment to include increased interest or finance charges as a result of the adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate or finance charge. The CFPB believes that such changes to payment amounts are also integral to alternative mortgage transactions. Indeed, if housing creditors were not permitted to increase the payment amount to account for an increase in the interest rate, the transaction could negatively amortize, which would be harmful to some consumers.\n            \n          ", 
                "Comment 1 clarifies that, regardless of whether a state law applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or applies to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions, that law is preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 to the extent that it restricts the ability of a state housing creditor to adjust or renegotiate an interest rate or finance charge with respect to an alternative mortgage transaction or to adjust payments as a result of such an adjustment or renegotiation. Thus, the preemption regime under \u00a7 1004.3 is not tied to whether a state law by its terms applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions.", 
                "Although the amendments to 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) indicate that state laws that regulate mortgage transactions generally are not preempted, the CFPB believes that narrowly focusing on whether a state law is by its terms general or specific would undermine the key determination of whether a state law <em data-original=\"E-03\">prohibits</em> an alternative mortgage transaction's adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate or finance charge or changes to payments as a result of the adjustment or renegotiation. For example, applying preemption to any state law that specifically addresses alternative mortgage transactions would preempt state laws that do not prohibit alternative mortgage transactions because they do not forbid, prevent, or hinder the ability of the state housing creditor to make such transactions (such as a state law requiring that certain disclosures be provided regarding alternative mortgage transactions). Furthermore, this approach would shield from preemption state laws that might be couched in general terms but effectively prohibit an alternative mortgage transaction (for example, a law prohibiting increases in an interest rate based on increases in an index). Finally, focusing solely on whether a state law is specific to alternative mortgage transactions or more general in its terms could lead to anomalous results if, for example, one state prohibited certain conduct in a statute that specifically applied to alternative mortgage transactions while another state prohibited the same conduct in a statute that applied generally to all mortgage transactions. For these reasons, the CFPB believes that it would be inconsistent with the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to make AMTPA preemption determinations based solely on whether a state law was specific or general by its terms.", 
                "Comment 2 also clarifies that state law restrictions on shared equity or shared appreciation transactions in which the creditor and the consumer share some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property are preempted by \u00a7 1004.3. As discussed above, such transactions are alternative mortgage transactions under \u00a7 1004.2(a). However, the CFPB solicits comment on whether additional protections are needed with respect to these types of transactions. The CFPB also solicits comment on the volume of these transactions.", 
                "In addition, comment 2 clarifies that state law underwriting requirements are preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 to the extent that they effectively restrict the adjustment or renegotiation of interest rates or finance charges or changes in payments as a result of such adjustments or renegotiations. For example, if a state law requires housing creditors to underwrite based on the maximum contractual rate, that particular provision of the law is preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 with respect to alternative mortgage transactions, regardless of whether the provision applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions. In contrast, state underwriting requirements of general applicability that do not impact the adjustment or renegotiation of interest rates or finance charges or changes in payments as a result of such adjustments or renegotiations are not preempted. (However, as discussed below, \u00a7 1004.4(c) requires state housing creditors that invoke AMTPA preemption to comply Regulation Z's underwriting requirements for high-cost and higher-cost mortgages.)", 
                "In contrast, comment 3 provides examples of state laws that are not preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 because they do not restrict the ability of the housing creditor to adjust or renegotiate an interest rate or finance charge or to change the amount of a payment as a result of such an adjustment or renegotiation. In particular, the comment states that, consistent with the amended 12 U.S.C. 3803(c), state law restrictions on prepayment penalties and late charges are not preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 regardless of whether the restriction applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions. Such a restriction does not prohibit or hinder a feature integral to an alternative mortgage transaction. The comment further clarifies that an increase in an interest rate or finance charge as a result of a late payment is a late charge for purposes of \u00a7 1004.3. Therefore, a state law that prohibits state housing creditors from increasing a consumer's interest rate as a result of a late payment is not preempted by \u00a7 1004.3.", 
                "In addition, comment 3 clarifies that state law restrictions on transactions in which one or more of the regular periodic payments may result in an increase in the principal balance (a negative amortization feature) or may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal (an interest-only feature) are not preempted by \u00a7 1004.3. The comment also clarifies that state law disclosure requirements are not preempted by \u00a7 1004.3 regardless of whether the law applies specifically to alternative mortgage transactions because disclosure requirements do not prohibit a state housing creditor from adjusting or renegotiating an interest rate or finance charge or making a corresponding change to a payment. Finally, the CFPB notes that, as a general matter, state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices are not preempted under 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) or this interim final rule.", 
                "The CFPB seeks comment on all aspects of \u00a7 1004.3(b) and on whether particular state laws should or should not be subject to AMTPA preemption. The CFPB notes, however, that nothing in this interim final rule affects the preemption of state law under provisions of federal law other than AMTPA."
