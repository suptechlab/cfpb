    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is publishing a final rule amending the official interpretations for Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). The Bureau is required to adjust annually the dollar amount that triggers requirements for certain home mortgage loans bearing fees above a certain amount. The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) sets forth rules for home- secured loans in which the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan consummation exceed the greater of $400 or 8 percent of the total loan amount. In keeping with the statute, the Bureau has adjusted the $400 amount based on the annual percentage change reflected in the Consumer Price Index as reported on June 1, 2012. The adjusted dollar amount for 2013 is $625.",
