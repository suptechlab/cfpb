Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A), to qualify as a small servicer, a servicer must service, together with any affiliates, 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, for all of which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee. There are two elements to this requirement. First, a servicer, together with any affiliates, must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. Second, a servicer must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee. To be the creditor or assignee of a mortgage loan, the servicer (or an affiliate) must either currently own the mortgage loan or must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A servicer is not a small servicer if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer or an affiliate is not the creditor or assignee (that is, for which the servicer or an affiliate is not the owner or was not the originator). The following two examples demonstrate circumstances in which a servicer would not qualify as a small servicer because it did not meet both requirements for determining a servicer's status as a small servicer:"

Mortgage loans that are not considered for purposes of determining whether a servicer is a small servicer pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) are not considered either for determining whether a servicer, together with any affiliates, services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans or whether a servicer is servicing only mortgage loans that it owns or originated. For example, assume a servicer services 5,400 mortgage loans. Of these mortgage loans, the servicer owns or originated 4,800 mortgage loans, voluntarily services 300 mortgage loans that it does not own or did not originate for an unaffiliated nonprofit organization for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees, and services 300 reverse mortgage transactions that it does not own and did not originate. Because the only mortgage loans considered are the 4,800 mortgage loans owned or originated by the servicer, the servicer is considered a small servicer and qualifies for the small servicer exemption with regard to all 5,400 mortgage loans it services. Note that reverse mortgages and mortgage loans secured by consumers' interests in timeshare plans, in addition to not being considered in determining small servicer qualification, are also exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. In contrast, although charitably serviced mortgage loans, as defined by \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), are likewise not considered in determining small servicer qualification, they are not exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. Thus, a servicer that does not qualify as a small servicer would not have to provide periodic statements for reverse mortgages and timeshare plans because they are exempt from the rule, but would have to provide periodic statements for mortgage loans it charitably services."

To satisfy \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4)(ii), a loan need not be actually purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or insured or guaranteed by one of the Agencies (the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or Rural Housing Service (RHS)). Rather, \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4)(ii) requires only that the creditor determine that the loan is eligible (i.e., meets the criteria) for such purchase, guarantee, or insurance at consummation. For example, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4), a creditor is not required to sell a loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either) for that loan to be a qualified mortgage; however, the loan must be eligible for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either), including satisfying any requirements regarding consideration and verification of a consumer's income or assets, credit history, debt-to-income ratio or residual income, and other credit risk factors, but not any requirements regarding matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay. To determine eligibility for purchase, guarantee or insurance, a creditor may rely on a valid underwriting recommendation provided by a GSE automated underwriting system (AUS) or an AUS that relies on an Agency underwriting tool; compliance with the standards in the GSE or Agency written guide in effect at the time; a written agreement between the creditor or a direct sponsor or aggregator of the creditor and a GSE or Agency that permits variation from the standards of the written guides and/or variation from the AUSs, in effect at the time of consummation; or an individual loan waiver granted by the GSE or Agency to the creditor. For creditors relying on the variances of a sponsor or aggregator, a loan that is transferred directly to or through the sponsor or aggregator at or after consummation complies with \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4). In using any of the four methods listed above, the creditor need not satisfy standards that are wholly unrelated to assessing a consumer's ability to repay that the creditor is required to perform. Matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay are those matters that are wholly unrelated to credit risk or the underwriting of the loan. Such matters include requirements related to the status of the creditor rather than the loan, requirements related to selling, securitizing, or delivering the loan, and any requirement that the creditor must perform after the consummated loan is sold, guaranteed, or endorsed for insurance such as document custody, quality control, or servicing.\n\nAccordingly, a covered transaction is eligible for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, for example, if:"

Because the loan still meets Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements, it remains a qualified mortgage based on these facts and circumstances."

Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) requires the creditor to calculate the ratio of the consumer's total monthly debt payments to total monthly income using the following standards, with additional requirements for calculating debt and income appearing in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(B). Where guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the Rural Housing Service, or issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) while operating under the conservatorship or receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or issued by a limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (collectively, Agency or GSE guidance) is in accordance with appendix Q, creditors may look to that guidance as a helpful resource in applying appendix Q. Moreover, when the following standards do not resolve how a specific kind of debt or income should be treated, the creditor may either (1) exclude the income or include the debt, or (2) rely on Agency or GSE guidance to resolve the issue. The following standards resolve the appropriate treatment of a specific kind of debt or income where the standards provide a discernible answer to the question of how to treat the debt or income. However, a creditor may not rely on Agency or GSE guidance to reach a resolution contrary to that provided by the following standards, even if such Agency or GSE guidance specifically addresses the particular type of debt or income but the following standards provide more generalized guidance."

Because \u00a7 1024.13 applies for all sections of Regulation X, the Bureau proposed to redesignate \u00a7 1024.13 as \u00a7 1024.5(c), located within \u201cSubpart A\u2014General Provisions.\u201d Further, the Bureau proposed to remove and reserve \u00a7 1024.13.",

Since issuing the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau had received inquiries as to whether Regulation X's mortgage servicing rules result in preemption of the field of mortgage servicing regulation. The Bureau had addressed this question in the preamble to the final rule, stating that \u201cthe Final Servicing Rules generally do not have the effect of prohibiting State law from affording borrowers broader consumer protection relating to mortgage servicing than those conferred under the Final Servicing Rules.\u201d\n            The preamble further stated that, although \u201cin certain circumstances, the effect of specific requirements of the Final Servicing Rules is to preempt certain limited aspects of state law\u201d in general, \u201cthe Bureau explicitly took into account existing standards (both State and Federal) and either built in flexibility or designed its rules to coexist with those standards.\u201d\n            \n          ",

Consistent with the preamble to the 2013 RESPA Servicing Final Rule, proposed comment 5(c)(1)-1 stated that State laws that are in conflict with the requirements of RESPA or Regulation X may be preempted by RESPA and Regulation X. Proposed comment 5(c)(1)-1 stated further that nothing in RESPA or Regulation X, including the provisions in subpart C with respect to mortgage servicers or mortgage servicing, should be construed to preempt the entire field of regulation of the covered practices. This proposed addition to the commentary was meant to clarify that RESPA and Regulation X do not effectuate field preemption of States' regulation of mortgage servicers or mortgage servicing.

                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Scope and application of the small servicer exemption.</em> The Bureau's proposal would have clarified the scope and application of the small servicer exemption. The proposal stated that determination of a servicer's status as a small servicer, and thus its eligibility for the small servicer exemption, is set forth in &#167; 1026.41(e)(4) and that, as set forth above, this standard is applicable by cross-reference to certain provisions of Regulation X. The proposal pointed out that Regulation X applies to &#8220;federally related mortgage loans,&#8221; which excludes certain loans that are &#8220;mortgage loans&#8221; as defined by Regulation Z &#167; 1026.41(a)(1). The proposed revision would have clarified that, to qualify for the small servicer exemption applicable to either rule, the servicer must qualify as a small servicer under &#167; 1026.41(a)(1)&#8212;a determination based on closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. The proposal would have clarified that this Regulation Z standard applies regardless of whether or not the loans considered are subject to the requirements of Regulation X. The Bureau noted in the proposal that, although some mortgage loans not subject to coverage under Regulation X are considered for purposes of determining eligibility as a small servicer, servicing such loans under Regulation X rules would not be required. Thus, the Bureau posited, a servicer that services 5,000 <em data-original=\"E-03\">federally related mortgage loans,</em> as defined by Regulation X, may service more than 5,000 <em data-original=\"E-03\">mortgage loans,</em> as defined by Regulation Z &#167; 1026.41(a)(1). The Bureau went on to explain that, in such a case, because the servicer's loans exceed the 5,000 mortgage loan limit, the servicer is not a small servicer and, thus, would not qualify for the small servicer exemption with regard to Regulation Z and Regulation X. The proposal reiterated that the servicer would not have to comply with Regulation X requirements for those mortgage loans counted for purposes of determining small servicer eligibility but which are not federally related mortgage loans. The proposal stated that by clarifying how a servicer determines whether it qualifies as a small servicer with regard to Regulation Z, the proposal also would have clarified how a servicer determines whether it qualifies for the small servicer exemptions from the applicable mortgage servicing requirements in Regulation X.",

To this end, the Bureau proposed to add comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-1, which would have clarified that, in general and pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(a)(1), the mortgage loans considered in determining qualification for the small servicer exemption are closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-1 also would have highlighted that, pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), certain closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling are not considered in determining status as a small servicer, as discussed further below in connection with proposed \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii).", 
                                "The Bureau requested comments and data regarding whether proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-1 would appropriately clarify the scope of mortgage loans that must be considered for determining if a servicer qualifies as a small servicer. The Bureau specifically requested comment and data regarding whether any servicers service a significant number of closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which are subject to Regulation Z, but service significantly fewer \u201cfederally related mortgage loans,\u201d which are subject to Regulation X. By way of example, the Bureau requested comment and data regarding whether any servicers would not be considered a small servicer if the small servicer exemption were based on whether a servicer services 5,000 or fewer closed end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, but would be a small servicer if the small servicer exemption were based on whether a servicer services 5,000 or fewer \u201cfederally related mortgage loan[s],\u201d as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.2. The proposal provided a specific example in a footnote of a servicer that services 10,000 construction loans, which are not considered \u201cfederally related mortgage loans\u201d pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.2, and 100 mortgage loans that are considered \u201cfederally related mortgage loans\u201d pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.2.\n            Such a servicer, the Bureau stated, would be considered to service 10,100 closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling and would not qualify for the small servicer exemption. The proposal, however, underscored the fact that, in any case, only the 100 federally related mortgage loans serviced by the servicer would be subject to the mortgage servicing requirements set forth in Regulation X pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.31."

Similarly, a credit union trade association recommended that the Bureau revise the rule to consider only \u201cfederally related mortgage loans\u201d instead of the more inclusive \u201cmortgage loans,\u201d as defined by the rule, but likewise provided no supporting data or reasoning. A trade association representing community banks generally urged the Bureau to reduce the loan pool used to determine small servicer status by limiting it to \u201cfederally related mortgage loans\u201d and, in the alternative, specifically recommended carving out construction loans\u2014one of the categories of loans not included in the definition of \u201cfederally related mortgage loans\u201d\u2014from the category of \u201cmortgage loans.\u201d The trade association set forth reasons why construction loans require less oversight than other mortgage loans. Finally, a trade association representing home builders voiced concern that the proposal's reference to construction loans in the footnote example might cause \u201cconfusion\u201d which could result in community banks reducing their construction loan portfolio to preserve their small servicer status. To avoid this possibility, the trade association recommended excluding construction loans from the loans considered in determining small servicer status."

                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Affiliate and master/subservicer relationships.</em> The Bureau also proposed to amend &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A), which states that a small servicer is a servicer that &#8220;services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, for all of which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee.&#8221; Proposed &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) would have provided clarification that, for purposes of determining small servicer status, a servicer considers the mortgage loans it services <em data-original=\"E-03\">together with any mortgage loans serviced by any affiliates.</em> This change, the Bureau explained, would conform that section with &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), which states that small servicer status is determined by counting &#8220;the number of mortgage loans serviced by the servicer and any affiliates as of January 1 for the remainder of the calendar year.&#8221; To avoid any risk of inconsistency, the Bureau believed it would have been appropriate to amend &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) to conform the language to &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) by adding the clause &#8220;together with any affiliates&#8221; such that a small servicer is a servicer that &#8220;services, <em data-original=\"E-03\">together with any affiliates,</em> 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, for all of which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee.&#8221; As stated in the proposal, this change would more fully conform the language of &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) with the language of &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) but would not change the meaning of the small servicer exemption.", 
                                "The Bureau also proposed to amend the comments to \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A). Specifically, comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-1 would have been redesignated as comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 and would have been amended to clarify several elements set forth in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. First, it would have clarified that there are two concurrent requirements for determining whether a servicer is a small servicer, as discussed further below. Second, it would have explained that the mortgage loans considered in making this determination are those serviced by the servicer as well as by its affiliates. Finally, it would have clarified that the second requirement of the small servicer test, that a servicer must be either the \u201ccreditor or assignee\u201d of the mortgage loans it services, means that the servicer must either currently own or have originated all of the mortgage loans it services. The comment also would have provided examples to illustrate these points.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 would have set forth the two requirements for determining if a servicer is a small servicer and would have clarified that both requirements apply to the mortgage loans serviced by the servicer as well as by its affiliates. The comment would have set forth both requirements: (1) A servicer, together with its affiliates, must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, and (2) the servicer must only service mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the creditor or assignee. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 further would have clarified that to be the \u201ccreditor or assignee\u201d of a mortgage loan, the servicer (or an affiliate) must either currently own the mortgage loan or must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan was initially payable. It also would have clarified that a servicer that only services such mortgage loans may qualify as a small servicer so long as the servicer also only services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. The Bureau stated that it believed that this clarification would provide a helpful alternative way of expressing the requirement stated in the rule that the servicer or affiliate must also be the creditor or assignee of a mortgage loan.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 also would have provided examples of specific circumstances demonstrating these requirements. The first example would have illustrated the effect affiliation has on the loan count requirement of the small servicer test. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2.i stated that if a servicer services 3,000 mortgage loans, but is affiliated (as defined at \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2))\n            with another servicer that services 4,000 other mortgage loans, both servicers are considered to service 7,000 mortgage loans and neither servicer is considered a small servicer. The second example would have illustrated the ownership requirement of the small servicer test. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2.ii stated that if a servicer services 3,100 mortgage loans, including 100 mortgage loans it neither owns nor originated but for which it owns the mortgage servicing rights, the servicer is not a small servicer. The proposal explained that this is because the servicer services some mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an affiliate) is not the creditor or assignee, notwithstanding that the total number of mortgage loans serviced is fewer than 5,000.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau proposed to redesignate comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 as 41(e)(4)(ii)-3 and to revise the comment so that it would provide further clarification regarding the application of the small servicer exemption in certain master servicer/subservicer relationships. Under the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau explained, comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 references Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.31, for the definitions of \u201cmaster servicer\u201d and \u201csubservicer\u201d that apply to the rule. It also provided an example demonstrating that even though a master servicer meets the definition of a small servicer, a subservicer retained by that master servicer that does not meet the definition does not qualify for the small servicer exemption.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-3 would have clarified that a small servicer does not lose its small servicer status because it retains a subservicer, as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.31, to service any of its mortgage loans. The comment also would have clarified that, for a subservicer, as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.31, to gain the benefit of the small servicer exemption, both the master servicer and the subservicer must be small servicers. The comment also would have pointed out that, generally, a subservicer will not qualify as a small servicer because it does not own or did not originate the mortgage loans it subservices. However, the comment went on to state, a subservicer would qualify as a small servicer if it is an affiliate of a master servicer that qualifies as a small servicer.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-3 also would have removed the example in 2013 TILA Servicing Rule comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-2 described above in favor of three other examples that would have demonstrated the implication of a master servicer/subservicer relationship for purposes of qualifying for the small servicer exemption. In the first proposed example, a credit union services 4,000 mortgage loans\u2014all of which it originated or owns. The credit union retains a credit union service organization to subservice 1,000 of the mortgage loans and the credit union services the remaining 3,000 mortgage loans itself. The credit union has no affiliation relationship with the credit union service organization. The credit union is a small servicer and, thus, the small servicer exemption applies to the 3,000 mortgage loans the credit union services itself. The credit union service organization is not a small servicer because it services mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate. Accordingly, the credit union service organization does not gain the benefit of the small servicer exemption and, thus, must comply with any applicable mortgage servicing requirements for the 1,000 mortgage loans it subservices.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-3.ii would have posited the example of a bank holding company that, through a lender subsidiary, owns or originated 4,000 mortgage loans. In the example, all mortgage servicing rights for the 4,000 mortgage loans are owned by a wholly owned master servicer subsidiary. Servicing for the 4,000 mortgage loans is conducted by a wholly owned subservicer subsidiary. The bank holding company controls all of these subsidiaries and, thus, they are affiliates of the bank holding company pursuant \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2). Because the master servicer and subservicer service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and because the mortgage loans are owned or originated by an affiliate of each, the master servicer and the subservicer are each considered a small servicer and qualify for the small servicer exemption for all 4,000 mortgage loans.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(ii)-3.iii would have posited the example of a nonbank servicer that services 4,000 mortgage loans, all of which it originated or owns. The servicer retains a \u201ccomponent servicer\u201d to assist it with servicing functions. The component servicer is not engaged in \u201cservicing\u201d as defined in 12 CFR 1024.2; that is, the component servicer does not receive any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any mortgage loan, including amounts for escrow accounts, and does not make the payments to the owner of the loan or other third parties of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may be required pursuant to the terms of the mortgage servicing loan documents or servicing contract. In this proposed example, the component servicer is not a subservicer pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.31 because it is not engaged in servicing, as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.2. The nonbank servicer is a small servicer and the small servicer exemption applies to all 4,000 mortgage loans it services."

                                "Many commenters expressed their appreciation for the Bureau's clarification of the affiliate and master/subservicer relationships. Among them, a trade association representing the banking industry noted that the proposed clarification of the affiliate relationship was consistent with the regulation as issued by the Bureau. Several commenters submitted comments outside the scope of this rulemaking recommending that the Bureau reconsider altogether the inclusion of affiliate loans in determining eligibility for the small servicer exemption. A trade association representing credit union service organizations (CUSOs), a national and state trade association representing credit unions, and two individual credit unions raised concerns that the affiliate relationships some CUSOs have with one or more credit unions would prevent those CUSOs (and their credit union affiliates) from qualifying for the small servicer exemption. (The proposed example clarifying the master/subservicer relationship included a CUSO that was not an affiliate.) These commenters recommended that the Bureau either revise the rule to remove affiliates and their mortgage loans from consideration in determining small servicer status or that the Bureau provide clarification regarding how to take into account the loans of CUSO affiliates that are not wholly-owned by credit unions or of CUSOs with multiple owners. Two of the commenters explained that many credit unions have an affiliate relationship with a CUSO to facilitate mortgage lending and borrowing. The trade associations noted the many cases of multiple credit unions affiliating with a single CUSO in order to achieve economies of scale and to maintain competitiveness in the marketplace. They indicated that these arrangements are particularly important for small credit unions with limited capacity. The trade association representing CUSOs voiced concern that the affiliate requirement in \u00a7 1026.41 could have a chilling effect on the mortgage CUSO industry by encouraging credit unions to divest their interests in CUSOs to maintain their small servicer exemption or by discouraging credit unions that qualify as small servicers from investing in an affiliate relationship with a CUSO."

With respect to the comments outside the scope of this rulemaking recommending that the Bureau exclude the mortgage loans of affiliates from consideration in determining small servicer status, the Bureau declines to revise the rule. In addition to the fact that reopening consideration of a major policy decision would require notice and comment relatively late in the implementation process, the Bureau continues to believe that the reasons underlying the rule as set forth in the 2013 Servicing Final Rules are persuasive on the merits.", 
                                "For clarification with regard to CUSOs and their relationships with one or more credit unions, the Bureau directs both the CUSOs and the credit unions to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>) to determine whether their particular business relationships constitute affiliate relationships.\n            For further clarification, the Bureau notes that, pursuant to the affiliate requirement in &#167; 1026.41, in any affiliate relationship with a CUSO, the total number of the mortgage loans of the affiliated entities must be considered in determining small servicer status. For example, for a credit union and its CUSO affiliate, the total number of mortgage loans serviced by both entities must be considered to determine the small servicer status for both the credit union and the CUSO.\n            The same is true for credit unions that are deemed affiliates under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."

First, proposed \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) would have replaced the reference to a servicer that \u201ccrosses the threshold\u201d for determining if the servicer qualifies as a small servicer with broader language indicating that a servicer that \u201cceases to qualify\u201d as a small servicer will have six months or until the next January 1, whichever is later, to comply with any requirements for which a servicer is no longer exempt as a small servicer. The Bureau stated it believed that the broader phrase \u201cceases to qualify\u201d would more accurately reflect the fact that there are two elements to determining if a servicer qualifies as a small servicer and pointed to the discussion above to underscore that either one of these elements could cause a servicer to lose exempt status.", 
                                "Proposed \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) therefore would have applied the transition period set out in the rule to situations in which a servicer no longer meets the loan count requirement as well as to situations in which the servicer no longer meets the requirement that the servicer is the creditor or assignee of all mortgage loans it services. Thus, the proposal stated, if a servicer exceeds the 5,000 mortgage loan limit or begins to service mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate, it must comply with any requirements from which it is no longer exempt by either the following January 1 or six months after the change in operations that disqualifies it as a small servicer, whichever is later. The proposal would have provided the example that, if on September 1 a servicer that previously qualified as a small servicer begins to service a mortgage loan that it does not own and did not originate, the servicer has until March 1 of the following year to comply with the requirements from which it was previously exempt as a small servicer."

The Bureau is revising comment 41(e)(4)(iii)-2 to maintain consistency with and further clarify the changes to the regulatory text the Bureau is adopting in \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), as discussed above.", 
                                "To this end, the Bureau is revising the heading of comment 41(e)(4)(iii)-2.

In addition, the Bureau is amending the examples in the comment to conform to and further clarify the changes the Bureau is adopting in the regulatory text. The first of the current examples states that a servicer that begins servicing more than 5,000 loans on October 1 and is servicing more than 5,000 loans as of January 1 of the following year would no longer be considered a small servicer on April 1 of that following year. The second current example states that a servicer that begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage loans on February 1, and services more than 5,000 loans as of January 1 of the following year, would no longer be considered a small servicer on January 1 of that following year.

                                "The revised examples clarify two points.

The second point of clarification is that January 1 is the date used to determine whether or not a servicer is considered a small servicer and the other dates (the latter of six months from the time the servicer ceases to be a small servicer or until the next January 1) are used to determine when a small servicer that has lost its small servicer status must begin complying with the regulations for which it had been exempt.", 
                                "The first revised example explains that a small servicer that begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage loans (or begins servicing one or more mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) on October 1 and is servicing 5,000 mortgage loans (or services one or more mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) as of January 1 of the following year, would no longer be considered a small servicer on January 1 of that following year and would have to comply with any requirements from which it is no longer exempt as a small servicer on April 1 of that following year. The second revised example states that a small servicer that begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage loans (or begins servicing one or more mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) on February 1, and services more than 5,000 mortgage loans (or begins servicing one or more mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) as of January 1 of the following year, would no longer be considered a small servicer on January 1 of that following year and would have to comply with any requirements from which it is no longer exempt as a small servicer on that same January 1. The third revised example states that a servicer that begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage loans (or begins servicing one or more mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) on February 1, but services less than 5,000 mortgage loans (or no longer services mortgage loans it does not own or did not originate) as of January 1 of the following year, is considered a small servicer for that following year.

                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Consideration of loans serviced.</em> The proposed rule also would have added language to &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) to specify which mortgage loans should not be considered in determining small servicer status. Proposed &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) would have clarified that certain closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling would not be considered for purposes of determining whether a servicer qualifies as a small servicer. Specifically, the proposal went on to explain, because reverse mortgage transactions and mortgage loans secured by a consumer's interest in timeshare plans are exempt from &#167; 1026.41, such loans are not considered when determining if a servicer is a small servicer. The proposed rule also would have clarified that, because coupon book loans are exempt only from some requirements of &#167; 1026.41, such loans must be considered in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer.", 
                                "The proposal also would have excluded from consideration in connection with the small servicer exemption, any mortgage loan voluntarily serviced by a servicer for a creditor or assignee that is not an affiliate of the servicer and for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees (\u201ccharitably serviced\u201d mortgage loans). The Bureau explained that it had received feedback that certain servicers that otherwise would be considered small servicers voluntarily service mortgage loans for unaffiliated nonprofit entities for charitable purposes and do not receive compensation or fees from engaging in that servicing. The Bureau further explained that, if such charitably serviced mortgage loans were considered in connection with determining whether a servicer qualifies as a small servicer, a servicer engaging in this practice would not qualify for the small servicer exemption because the servicer would be servicing a mortgage loan it does not own or did not originate, notwithstanding that such servicer undertook to service those mortgage loans for charitable purposes.", 
                                "The Bureau expressed concern that including charitably serviced mortgage loans in determining small servicer status would cause servicers to refrain from charitable servicing rather than lose the benefits of a small servicer exemption. The Bureau stated its belief that such a result would not further the goal of consumer protection for the affected consumers and might instead negatively affect the availability and costs of credit for consumers whose mortgage loans would otherwise be serviced pursuant to such charitable arrangements. Further, the Bureau believed that consumers would be more likely to receive superior service from an entity in the business of servicing that is willing to donate its services than they would if nonprofit entities that are not experienced in the business of servicing were forced to take on those duties themselves. Finally, the Bureau stated that it believed that the benefits of excluding charitably serviced mortgage loans from small servicer determination would outweigh the potential risks to consumers that exclusion may pose.", 
                                "The Bureau proposed that, for the reasons set forth above and pursuant to the Bureau's exemption authority and authority to provide for adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions as may be necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, under TILA sections 105(a) and (f), mortgage loans voluntarily serviced by a servicer for a creditor or assignee that is not an affiliate of the servicer and for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees would not be considered in determining a servicer's qualification as a small servicer. The Bureau stated that it believed that considering such loans in determining if a servicer is a small servicer would defeat the purposes of TILA by penalizing charitable servicers, thereby dissuading them from engaging in charitable servicing to the detriment of the consumers that otherwise would benefit from this activity. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether it would be appropriate not to consider such mortgage loans when determining if a servicer qualifies for the small servicer exemption. The Bureau further requested comment on whether other mortgage loans serviced through similar limited arrangements should not be considered in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer. The Bureau emphasized in its proposed rule that it was neither reexamining nor seeking comment on the issue of exempting nonprofit entities engaged in mortgage servicing from the requirements of the periodic statement or any other mortgage servicing rule.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau proposed to add comment 41(e)(4)(iii)-3. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(iii)-3 would have clarified that mortgage loans that are not considered for purposes of determining small servicer qualification pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), are not considered for determining either whether a servicer services, together with any affiliates, 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans or whether a servicer is servicing mortgage loans that it does not own or did not originate. Proposed comment 41(e)(4)(iii)-3 further would have posited the example of a servicer that services a total of 5,400 mortgage loans, of which the servicer owns or originated 4,800 mortgage loans, services 300 reverse mortgage transactions that it does not own or did not originate, and voluntarily services 300 mortgage loans that it does not own or did not originate for an unaffiliated nonprofit organization for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees. The example stated that neither the reverse mortgage transactions nor the mortgage loans voluntarily serviced by the servicer are considered for purposes of determining if the servicer is a small servicer. The example concluded that, because the only mortgage loans considered are the 4,800 other mortgage loans serviced by the servicer, and the servicer owns or originated each of those mortgage loans, the servicer is considered a small servicer and qualifies for the small servicer exemption with regard to all 5,400 mortgage loans it services. The comment also would have noted that reverse mortgages and transactions secured by a consumer's interest in timeshare plans, in addition to not being considered in determining small servicer qualification, also are <em data-original=\"E-03\">exempt</em> from the requirements of &#167; 1026.41. In contrast, the proposed comment noted, although charitably serviced mortgage loans, as defined by &#167; 1026.41(e)(4)(iii), are likewise not considered in determining small servicer qualification, they are <em data-original=\"E-03\">not exempt</em> from the requirements of &#167; 1026.41. The comment thus would have clarified that a servicer that does <em data-original=\"E-03\">not</em> qualify as a small servicer would not be required to provide periodic statements for reverse mortgages and timeshare plans because they are exempt from the rule, but would be required to provide periodic statements for the mortgage loans it charitably services.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Legal authority.</em> The Bureau proposed to exclude charitably serviced mortgage loans and reverse mortgage transactions from consideration in determining a servicer's status as a small servicer for purposes of the small servicer exemption in &#167; 1024.41(e)(4) pursuant to its authority to provide for adjustments and exceptions under TILA section 105(a) and (f).\n\n            The proposal went on to say that, with respect to charitably serviced mortgage loans, the Bureau believed, for the reasons described above, that declining to consider such mortgage loans for purposes of determining eligibility as a small servicer would effectuate the purposes of, and would facilitate compliance with TILA and Regulation Z. The proposal further stated that, consistent with TILA section 105(f) and in light of the factors in that provision, the Bureau believed that requiring servicers to consider mortgage loans they charitably service for purposes of determining eligibility as a small servicer would cause mortgage servicers to withdraw from such charitable relationships and not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection. In addition, the Bureau expressed its concern regarding the extent to which any requirement to consider such loans would complicate, hinder, or make more expensive the credit process for such mortgage loan transactions, especially considering the status of the borrowers that typically secure mortgage loans that are charitably serviced. The Bureau said that ultimately it believed the goal of consumer protection would be undermined if it were to consider, for purposes of small servicer qualification, mortgage loans voluntarily serviced by a servicer for a creditor or assignee that is not an affiliate of the servicer and for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees.", 
                                "In the proposed rule, the Bureau said it similarly believed that not considering reverse mortgages in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer would effectuate the purposes of, and would facilitate compliance with, TILA and Regulation Z. The Bureau said it believed this for the same reasons set forth in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule\n            exempting reverse mortgages from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. The Bureau pointed to the discussion in that final rule that the periodic statement requirements were designed for a traditional mortgage product and that information relevant and useful for consumers with reverse mortgages differs substantially from the information required on the periodic statement and, thus, would not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers of reverse mortgages. Finally, the proposal put forth the Bureau's belief that not considering reverse mortgages in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer is proper irrespective of the amount of the loan, the status of the consumer (including related financial arrangements, financial sophistication, and the importance to the consumer of the loan), or whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the consumer."

                                "The Bureau received only positive comments regarding its proposed clarification that reverse mortgage transactions and mortgage loans secured by a consumer's interest in timeshare plans, which are exempt from all provisions of \u00a7 1026.41, are excluded from the loan pool used to determine eligibility for the small servicer exemption. However, one national trade association representing credit unions contested the Bureau's clarification that fixed-rate loans with coupon books must be considered for purposes of determining eligibility for the small servicer exemption. The commenter said that including fixed-rate loans with coupon books in the loan pool used to determine small servicer status but excluding them from the requirement to provide periodic statements would create confusion without providing adequate benefits. The Bureau disagrees and notes, as discussed above, that fixed-rate loans with coupon books are exempt only from some of the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41\u2014as opposed to reverse mortgage transactions and mortgage loans secured by a consumer's interest in timeshare plans which are not subject to any of the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41. Servicers servicing fixed-rate loans with coupon books are exempt from the requirement to provide periodic statements for these loans under \u00a7 1026.41, but servicers nevertheless have to provide to consumers with such loans the information contained in the periodic statement, either in the coupon book or in some other form. Because servicers servicing fixed-rate loans with coupon books must comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41 regarding those mortgage loans, it is appropriate that such loans would be considered in determining whether such servicers are small servicers and therefore exempt from complying with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41 with regard to those loans. Conversely, it is appropriate to exclude reverse mortgage transactions and mortgage loans secured by a consumer's interest in timeshare plans from the loan pool used to determine small servicer status because, regardless of that servicer's small servicer status, there is no requirement for the servicer to comply with any of the requirements of \u00a7 1026.41 with regard to those loans.", 
                                "The Bureau received strong support for its proposed revision of \u00a7 1026.41 to exclude charitably serviced loans from consideration in determining whether a servicer qualifies as a small servicer, that is, mortgage loans voluntarily serviced for a non-affiliate creditor or assignee and for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees. Commenters agreed that, absent the Bureau's proposal, small servicers likely would relinquish their volunteer efforts in order to preserve their small servicer status. In response to one commenter's request for clarification, the Bureau notes that its proposed revision of the rule with regard to volunteer servicing is not limited to the servicing of mortgage loans owned or originated by nonprofit organizations, although the Bureau suspects that most charitable servicing is done on behalf of such organizations. Due to the support received by the Bureau for its proposed revision of \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(iii)(A) excluding charitably serviced mortgage loans from the loan pool used to determine small servicer eligibility, and for the reasons stated above, the Bureau is adopting the revision as proposed.", 
                                "In addition to requesting comment regarding the appropriateness of excluding charitably serviced mortgage loans when determining small servicer status, the proposal solicited comment on whether other mortgage loans serviced through similar limited arrangements should not be considered in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer. The Bureau did not receive comments recommending that any other servicing arrangements be excluded from consideration for purposes of determining small servicer status. The Bureau did receive a comment outside of the scope of the proposal from a national trade association requesting guidance regarding the trade association's conclusion that certain depository services some of its members provide for depositors who self-finance the sale of residential real estate do not qualify as \u201cservicing,\u201d as defined in 12 CFR 1024.2(b). The trade association explained that, for a minimal fee, some banks\u2014usually small banks\u2014receive mortgage payments from a borrower and deposit the funds into that customer's account. According to the trade association, the agreement between the bank and the depositor/creditor typically excludes any other services, such as providing servicing in the case of delinquency. The trade association expressed concern that small institutions will discontinue this service for their depository customers who owner-finance the sale of real property for fear of losing their small servicer status if the depository service could be construed as servicing mortgage loans that the bank does not own or did not originate.", 
                                "Because the comment was outside the scope of the proposal, the Bureau declines to provide the requested guidance. Moreover, even if the comment were within the scope of the proposal, the Bureau is not able to provide guidance at this juncture because the trade association did not provide sufficient information about the banking service described."

                                "As adopted by the 2013 ATR Final Rule, comment 43(e)(4)-4 clarifies that, to satisfy \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4)(ii), a loan need not be actually purchased or guaranteed by a GSE or insured or guaranteed by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS. Rather, \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4)(ii) requires only that the loan be eligible for such purchase, guarantee, or insurance. For example, the comment provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4), a creditor is not required to sell a loan to a GSE for that loan to be a qualified mortgage. Rather, the loan must be eligible for purchase or guarantee by a GSE. The Commentary clarifies that, with respect to GSEs, to determine eligibility, a creditor may rely on an underwriting recommendation provided by one of the GSEs' automated underwriting systems (AUSs) or their written guides. Accordingly, with regard to the GSEs, the comment states that a covered transaction is eligible for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (and therefore a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4)) if: (i) the loan conforms to the standards set forth in the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide; or (ii) the loan receives an \u201cApprove/Eligible\u201d recommendation from Desktop Underwriter (DU); or an \u201cAccept and Eligible to Purchase\u201d recommendation from Loan Prospector (LP).", 
                                "The Bureau proposed to revise comment 43(e)(4)-4 in a number of ways. First, the proposal would have clarified that a creditor is not required to comply with all GSE or agency requirements to show qualified mortgage status. Specifically, the proposed revision made clear that the creditor need not comply with certain requirements that are wholly unrelated to a consumer's ability to repay, including activities related to selling, securitizing, or delivering consummated loans and any requirement the creditor is required to perform after the consummated loan is sold, guaranteed, or endorsed for insurance (in the case of agency loans) such as document custody, quality control, and servicing. These requirements are spelled out in the most depth in the GSE and agency written guides, but may also be referenced in automated underwriting system conditions and in written agreements with individual creditors, as discussed further below.", 
                                "The Bureau believed that the proposed comment would clarify the intended scope of the temporary category of qualified mortgage created in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) and facilitate compliance with the provisions of Regulation Z adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As explained in the preamble to the final rule, the Bureau established \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) as a temporary transition measure designed to ensure access to responsible, affordable credit for consumers with debt-to-income ratios that exceed the 43 percent threshold that the Bureau adopted as a bright-line standard in the permanent general definition of qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2) while creditors adapted to the new ATR rules and other changes in economic and regulatory conditions. The Bureau believed that using widely recognized underwriting standards of Federal agencies and entities under Federal conservatorship to define qualified mortgages during this interim period would both facilitate compliance and ensure responsible lending practices. The temporary provision therefore bases qualified mortgage status on <em data-original=\"E-03\">eligibility</em> for purchase, insurance, or guarantee, which requires use of the federally related underwriting standards, but does not require actual sale, guarantee, or insurance endorsement. Furthermore, the temporary provision requires that a qualified mortgage must be eligible at consummation.", 
                                "However, the Bureau recognized in the proposed rule that the GSEs and agencies impose a wide variety of requirements relating not only to underwriting of potentially eligible loans, but also to the mechanics of sale, guarantee, or insurance and post-consummation activities. Because underwriting is a complex process that involves assessment of the consumer's ability to repay the loan as well as other credit risk factors, the Bureau believed that it was appropriate to base qualified mortgage status under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) on the GSEs' and agencies' general standards concerning borrower, product, and mortgage eligibility and underwriting. While some of these underwriting requirements may be more closely or directly related to assessing a consumer's ability to repay than others, the Bureau believed that attempting to disaggregate them would be an extraordinarily complex task that would defeat the purposes of the temporary definition in adopting widely recognized standards to facilitate compliance and access to responsible credit. Where groups of requirements are wholly unrelated to underwriting (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> wholly unrelated to assessing ability to repay and other risk-related factors), however, the Bureau believed that it was appropriate to specify that such requirements do not affect qualified mortgage status.", 
                                "The Bureau believed that the items described in the comment would meet this test and provide greater clarity to the temporary definition of qualified mortgage. Because TILA requires assessment of a consumer's ability to repay a loan as of the time of consummation, the Bureau believed that GSE and agency requirements relating to post-consummation activity should not be relevant to qualified mortgage status. And because the temporary definition does not require actual purchase, guarantee, or insurance, the Bureau believed that it would not be appropriate to base qualified mortgage status on elements of the guides relating to the mechanics of actual delivery, purchase, guarantee, and endorsement. The Bureau recognized that most requirements wholly unrelated to underwriting involve post-consummation activity; however, pre-consummation GSE and agency requirements could also be wholly unrelated to underwriting. For example, the status of a creditor's approval or eligibility to do business with a GSE is not relevant for ascertaining qualified mortgage status using an AUS. The Bureau invited comment on this proposed clarification generally and on whether other GSE or agency requirements should be excluded."

This consumer group is also a nonprofit lender. Its comment suggested that the Bureau should state clearly those issues that are \u201crelated\u201d to ability to repay, such as income or obligations that materially impact ability to repay, and violations of specific QM product restrictions, and rule out such things as credit score and appraisal requirements. This commenter also stated that failure to make this guidance clearer could reduce credit availability.",

Most, however, also suggested that the guidance on what would be considered wholly unrelated to ability to repay should be clarified and the excluded items or categories expanded. Commenters agreed that failure to comply with post-consummation requirements should be excluded. As did the consumer group in the comment referenced above, some industry commenters requested that the Bureau make clear that items deemed related to ability to repay be limited to narrow issues of a borrower's ability to make the loan's payments, and that other risk-related factors be excluded. Specifically, commenters asked that factors related to willingness to repay (as opposed to ability to repay) and issues involving the attributes or defects of the collateral be excluded. Some commenters raised the issue of excluding jumbo loans.\n            Two commenters requested that a time limit be imposed so that repurchase or indemnification claims on seasoned loans would be disregarded. One commenter stated that income determinations are variable and subjective, so errors made in good faith should not invalidate QM status.

In addition, comment 43(e)(4)-4 has been revised to state that matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay are those matters that are wholly unrelated to credit risk or the underwriting of the loan, and to provide more detailed guidance on applying the standard.", 
                                "As stated in the proposed rule, underwriting is a complex process that involves assessment of the consumer's ability to repay the loan as well as a variety of other credit risk factors. The Bureau made a deliberate decision in the 2013 ATR Final Rule to base qualified mortgage status under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) on the GSEs' and agencies' general underwriting and credit risk analysis standards. While some of these factors may be more closely and directly focused on consumers' ability to repay than others, the Bureau continues to believe that attempting to disaggregate GSE and agency underwriting requirements based on degree of relationship to ability to repay would be an extraordinarily complex task that would defeat the purposes of the temporary definition in adopting widely recognized standards to facilitate compliance and access to responsible credit. Indeed, the statute itself requires consideration of a borrower's credit history, which could relate to willingness as well as ability to repay. Exclusion of requirements regarding collateral and other risk-related factors would require line-drawing exercises that could potentially interfere with the regulatory purpose. Moreover, allowing disaggregation would not be consistent with the use of AUS determinations to demonstrate compliance, as they involve interdependent risk factors and do not focus solely on a borrower's capacity to make payments.",

Accordingly, the Bureau considers events occurring after consummation and GSE and agency requirements concerning execution of an actual sale, insuring, or guarantee of the loan to be wholly unrelated to ability to repay.\n            In addition, the Bureau believes that in regard to very limited matters, such as the status of a creditor's approval or eligibility to do business with a GSE, additional pre-consummation occurrences may also be wholly unrelated to ability to repay. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised the language in the final comment to identify specifically that these sets of requirements are considered wholly unrelated to ability to repay for purposes of the rule.",

The proposed revision of the comment explained that to rely upon an AUS recommendation to demonstrate qualified mortgage status a creditor must have (1) accurately inputted the loan information into the automated system, and (2) satisfied any accompanying requirements or conditions to the AUS approval that would otherwise invalidate the recommendation, unless, as discussed above, the conditions are wholly unrelated to the consumer's ability to repay. The comment as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule assumed that any recommendation used for compliance would be valid, and these clarifications merely listed two criteria that should be monitored to ensure that validity. In particular, because the AUSs generate a list of conditions that must be met in support of the approval designation, the Bureau believed that those conditions must be satisfied to show eligibility for purchase, guarantee, or insurance.

                                "The Bureau also proposed to revise comment 43(e)(4)-4 in a third way to clarify further that a loan meeting eligibility requirements provided in a written agreement between the creditor and a GSE or agency that permits variation from the standards of the written guides and/or AUSs in effect at the time of consummation is also eligible for purchase or guarantee by the GSEs or insurance or guarantee by the agencies for the purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4). Thus, such loans would be qualified mortgages. The Bureau recognized that these agreements between creditors and the GSEs or agencies effectively constitute modification of, or substitutes for, the general manuals or AUSs with regard to these creditors. In many cases, the agreements allow the creditors to use other automated underwriting systems rather than the GSE or agency systems, subject to certain conditions or limitations on which loans the GSE or agency will accept as eligible for purchase, guarantee, or insurance. The Bureau believed that it was therefore appropriate for the purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) to consider the agreements to be equivalent to the standard written guides for purposes of the specific creditor to which the agreement applies. Many of these agreements are necessary to accommodate local and regional market variations and other considerations that do not substantially relate to ATR-related underwriting criteria and therefore are generally consistent with the consumer protection and other purposes of the rule. However, the Bureau did not believe that it would be appropriate to allow one creditor to rely on the terms specified in another creditor's written agreement with a GSE or agency to establish qualified mortgage status, as the written agreements are individually negotiated and monitored. The Bureau sought comment on this proposed clarification generally and on whether other variations on standard guides and eligibility criteria should be considered."

One comment, from a group of organizations, stated that allowing use of variances was a mistake because the agreements are private and this would make them very difficult for consumers to enforce when they are violated. This comment also suggested that if the variance provision is adopted the Bureau should make clear that a borrower would have access to such variance agreements by sending a qualified written request under RESPA.

Other industry commenters requested that the Bureau make clear that later assignees could rely on the QM status of loans originated pursuant to a variance.

They further stated that this problem could interfere with the origination of a large number of loans that meet the GSEs' standards, and argued that correspondent lenders should be allowed to rely on the variances of their sponsors or aggregators. One large bank, however, opposed the idea of allowing one creditor to rely on another's variance, stating that this might allow loans to become QMs after consummation.",

The Bureau agrees that disallowing correspondent use of variances would interfere unduly with the market, and is adding language to clarify use in such circumstances without allowing wholly unrelated entities to rely on some other creditor's agreement.

The variance applied to a transaction must be in effect at the time a loan is consummated, and the loan must meet all relevant requirements at that time. For this reason, a loan cannot be retroactively made into a QM by a creditor or assignee. In addition, because the status is determined at consummation, later assignees can rely on that status if it is valid. Allowing correspondents to rely on the variances of their sponsors or aggregators in effect at the time of consummation will not change this situation, and it will help to alleviate concerns that only larger market participants may take advantage of negotiated variances. The language of comment 43(e)(4)-4 has been crafted to ensure that the correspondent is involved in a direct relationship with the variance holder and originating the QM pursuant to that relationship.",

The proposed comment did not amend the meaning of the current rule but clarified how a determination of the qualified mortgage status of a loan should be understood in relation to claims that the loan was not eligible for purchase, insurance, or guarantee and therefore not a qualified mortgage. In making the proposal, the Bureau understood that facts upon which eligibility status was determined at or before consummation could later be found to be incorrect. Often, a repurchase or indemnification demand by a GSE or an agency involves such issues. However, the mere occurrence of a GSE or agency demand that a creditor repurchase a loan or indemnify the agency for an insurance claim does not necessarily mean that the loan is not a qualified mortgage.", 
                                "Proposed comment 43(e)(4)-5 would have provided that a repurchase or indemnification demand by the GSEs, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS is not dispositive in ascertaining qualified mortgage status. Much as qualified mortgage status under the general definition in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2) may typically turn on whether the consumer's debt-to-income ratio at the time of consummation was equal to or less than 43 percent, qualified mortgage status under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) may typically turn on whether the loan was eligible for purchase, guarantee, or insurance at the time of consummation. Thus, for example, a demand for repurchase or indemnification based on post-consummation GSE or agency requirements would therefore not be relevant to qualified mortgage status. As indicated above, such factors meet the wholly unrelated to ability to repay standard that the Bureau is finalizing in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4). Only reasons for a repurchase or indemnification demand that specifically apply to the qualified mortgage status of the loan under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) would be relevant, as discussed above in connection with comment 43(e)(4)-4. Moreover, the mere fact that a demand has been made, or even resolved, between a creditor and GSE or agency is not dispositive with regard to eligibility for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4), as those parties are involved in an ongoing business relationship rather than an adjudicatory process. However, evidence of whether a particular loan satisfied the \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) eligibility criteria at consummation may be brought to light in the course of dealings over a particular demand, depending on the facts and circumstances. Such evidence\u2014like any evidence discovered after consummation that relates to the facts as of the time of consummation\u2014may be relevant in assessing whether a particular loan is a qualified mortgage.", 
                                "To clarify this point further, proposed comment 43(e)(4)-5 included two examples of relevant evidence discovered after consummation. In the first example, one would assume that a loan's eligibility for purchase was based in part on the consumer's employment income of $50,000 per year. The creditor uses the income figure in obtaining an approve/eligible recommendation from DU. A quality control review, however, later determines that the documentation provided and verified by the creditor to comply with Fannie Mae requirements did not support the reported income of $50,000 per year. As a result, Fannie Mae demands that the creditor repurchase the loan. Assume that the quality control review is accurate, and that DU would not have issued an approve/eligible recommendation if it had been provided the accurate income figure. The Bureau believed that, given the facts and circumstances of this example, the DU determination at the time of consummation was invalid because it was based on inaccurate information provided by the creditor; therefore, the loan was never a qualified mortgage.", 
                                "For the second example, one would assume that a creditor delivered a loan, which the creditor determined was a qualified mortgage at the time of consummation, to Fannie Mae for inclusion in a particular To-Be-Announced Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) pool of loans. The data submitted by the creditor at the time of loan delivery indicated that the various loan terms met the product type, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, and other MBS pooling criteria, and MBS issuance disclosures to investors reflected this loan data. However, after delivery and MBS issuance, a quality control review determines that the loan violates the pooling criteria. The loan still meets eligibility requirements for other Fannie Mae products and loan terms. Fannie Mae, however, requires the creditor to repurchase the loan due to the violation of MBS pooling requirements. Assume that the quality control review determination is accurate. The reason the creditor repurchases this loan would not be relevant to the loan's qualified mortgage status. The loan still meets other Fannie Mae eligibility requirements and therefore remains a qualified mortgage based on these facts and circumstances.",

The Bureau also solicited comment on whether additional examples or other particular situations should be provided or whether alternatives for eligibility other than relationship to ability-to-repay standards should be adopted that would determine the qualified mortgage status of a loan."

                                "Regarding the first example in the comment, it is not the repurchase demand nor the quality control review that is dispositive as to QM status, but the fact that the finding that the income figure is unsupported by the documentation is stated to be \u201caccurate.\u201d The example is a hypothetical, and assuming the accuracy of an issue that would normally have to be established through an investigation of the facts and circumstances of the transaction allows for better explanation of how the rule works. As for the issue of what should be considered a repurchase or indemnification demand, the question is irrelevant to QM status. Repurchase or indemnification demands are potentially relevant to QM status only because they may indicate or lead to evidence that a loan did not qualify as a QM at the time of consummation. In addition, the Bureau believes that the examples will increase clarity for stakeholders, and not cause confusion. Accordingly, the Bureau considers the two examples presented as providing clear and appropriate guidance on the issue, with the edits mentioned above."

Section 1026.43(e)(4) provides a definition of qualified mortgage for loans that (1) meet the prohibitions on certain risky loan features (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> negative amortization and interest only features); (2) do not exceed certain limitations on points and fees under &#167; 1026.43(e)(2); and (3) either are eligible for purchase or guarantee by one of the GSEs, while under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or are eligible to be insured or guaranteed by HUD under the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1707 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>), the VA, the USDA, or RHS.\n\n            HUD, VA, USDA, and RHS have authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to define qualified mortgage standards for the types of loans they insure, guarantee, or administer. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 129C(b)(3)(B)(ii).

To determine whether the consumer meets the specific DTI requirement, the creditor must calculate the consumer's monthly DTI in accordance with appendix Q. The Bureau adopted the 43 percent DTI requirement and other modifications to the statutory criteria pursuant to its authorities under TILA section 129C and 105(a).\n            \n          ",

                                "In adopting appendix Q in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau believed that using, to the extent possible, existing HUD/FHA underwriting guidelines as the foundation for determining \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d for DTI purposes would provide creditors with well-established standards for determining whether a loan is a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2).", 
                                "Following publication of the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau received a number of inquiries from industry stakeholders regarding provisions codified in the appendix that they believed had been intended to function as flexible standards used by the FHA for insurance underwriting purposes, rather than codified as bright-line requirements for determining debt and income. Concerns were raised that these provisions may be properly suited for the purposes of a holistic and qualitative underwriting analysis but are not well-suited to function as regulatory requirements that are not subject to discretionary variance or waiver on an individual basis. Stakeholders also expressed concern that many of these provisions provided little clarity or guidance for creditors for compliance purposes. Similarly, stakeholders expressed concerns that the broad nature of these provisions could undermine the presumption of compliance available to creditors who make qualified mortgages and expose them to significant litigation risk.", 
                                "In response to these concerns, the Bureau included certain proposed revisions to appendix Q in its proposed rule to facilitate compliance when determining DTI and to further the purposes of the ATR Final Rule. The Bureau agreed that certain provisions of appendix Q as adopted were not properly suited to function as regulations. The Bureau intended appendix Q to serve as a reliable mechanism for creditors to evaluate income and debts for the purpose of determining DTI and not as a general and flexible underwriting policy for assessing risk (as it is used by FHA in the context of insurance). The Bureau also recognized that it would not have the same level of discretion regarding the application of appendix Q.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau therefore proposed revisions to appendix Q on: (1) Stability of income, and the creditor requirement to evaluate the probability of the consumer's continued employment; (2) with regard to salary, wage, and other forms of consumer income, the creditor requirement to determine whether the consumer's income level can reasonably be expected to continue; (3) creditor analysis of consumer overtime and bonus income; (4) creditor analysis of consumer Social Security income; (5) requirements related to the analysis of self-employed consumer income; (6) requirements related to non-employment related consumer income, including creditor analysis of consumer trust income; and (7) creditor analysis of rental income.", 
                                "The Bureau also proposed other revisions to clarify the application of appendix Q, as well as general technical and wording changes throughout appendix Q for consistency and clarification, including technical changes to conform to the specific purpose that appendix Q serves in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, as opposed to the function that the HUD Handbook serves for FHA underwriting."

                                                "Appendix Q as adopted required in section I.A.3.a that creditors evaluate the \u201cprobability of continued employment\u201d by analyzing, among other things, (1) the consumer's past employment record; (2) the consumer's qualification for the position; (3) the consumer's previous training and education; and (4) the employer's confirmation of continued employment. Stakeholders had raised concerns that, beyond analysis of a consumer's past employment record and current employment status, each of these requirements was incompatible with appendix Q's purpose of providing clear rules for determining debt and income, and was likely to result in compliance difficulty and significant exposure to litigation risk for creditors attempting to avoid such risk by originating qualified mortgages and thereby taking advantage of the presumption of compliance. Stakeholders, for example, indicated that many employers were likely to be unwilling for various reasons (including but not limited to economic uncertainty) to confirm that a consumer's employment will continue into the future, and similarly creditors may be unqualified to evaluate a consumer's education, training, and job qualifications.", 
                                                "In response to these concerns, the Bureau proposed to amend appendix Q in section I.A.3.a to eliminate the requirements that creditors determine the \u201cprobability of continued employment\u201d by considering a consumer's \u201cqualifications for the position\u201d and \u201cprevious training and education.\u201d The Bureau proposed instead to amend the section to require creditors to examine a consumer's past and current employment. The Bureau also proposed to remove the requirement that creditors obtain the \u201cemployer's confirmation of continued employment\u201d and instead require only that the creditor examine the \u201cemployer's confirmation of current, ongoing employment status.\u201d The Bureau believed that requirements for a creditor to evaluate a consumer's training, education, and qualifications for his or her position are not well-suited to function as regulations designed to enable creditors to determine debts and income and in turn calculate DTI, and may increase exposure to litigation risk. Specifically, the Bureau indicated that it was not entirely clear what creditors would need to do in order to comply with these requirements, or how those determinations would affect a consumer's income for the purpose of calculating DTI.", 
                                                "The Bureau also stated its belief that requiring creditors to obtain an employer's confirmation of the consumer's continued employment would not function properly as a regulatory requirement because employers likely would be unwilling to provide any confirmation of employment continuing beyond current, ongoing employment. The Bureau pointed out that without the benefit of waiver or variance, such a requirement could serve to disqualify any such consumer's employment income from being included in the DTI calculation\u2014which would frustrate access to credit.", 
                                                "The Bureau stated further that a confirmation of current, ongoing employment status is adequate to verify employment for purposes of determining income. To that end, the Bureau also proposed for clarification purposes a proposed note to section I.A.3 that states creditors may assume that employment is ongoing if a consumer's employer verifies current employment and does not indicate that employment has been, or is set to be terminated. The proposed note made clear, however, that creditors should not rely upon a verification of current employment that includes an affirmative statement that the employment is likely to cease, such as a statement that indicates the employee has given (or been given) notice of employment suspension or termination.",

The commenter noted that these contracts are generally renewable and negotiated through the teacher's association or other union representation. The commenter stated that the Bureau's proposed note would likely preclude it from relying upon a copy of a member's contract as evidence of stability of income since if the contract included a termination date the commenter would be unable to assume that the member's employment is \u201congoing.\u201d The commenter suggested the proposed note be expanded to consider fields of employment that may be viewed as \u201cseasonal\u201d or industries where employment is established by contract, such as the education community, so that a creditor could also examine past and current employment as part of its analysis of the stability of income.",

Section I.A.3.b provides that \u201ccreditors may favorably consider the stability of a consumer's income if he/she changes jobs frequently within the same line of work, but continues to advance in income or benefits. In this analysis, income stability takes precedence over job stability.\u201d The commenter stated that this section existed as a caveat to the obligation of creditors to predict a consumer's future employment or advancement, and with the elimination of that requirement it is no longer necessary.\n          "

The Bureau agrees with commenters that elimination of the requirements that the creditor: (1) examine the consumer's qualifications for the position, previous training and education; and (2) examine the employer's confirmation of the consumer's continued employment\u2014will provide clearer and more appropriate standards for creditors under appendix Q, and facilitate compliance with the Bureau's ATR Final Rule.",

The Bureau believes, however, that additional revisions to section I.A.3.a are not necessary given the existing provisions of appendix Q with regard to the treatment of seasonal employment and income. That language, at sections I.A.2.b and I.B.5, provides the means for creditor assessment of the employment and stability of income of contract employees for purposes of appendix Q.\n            \n          ",

That section, as revised, only provides that a creditor cannot rely on a verification of current employment if it includes an affirmative statement that employment is likely to cease.", 
                                                "Concerning the comment requesting that the Bureau provide guidance to explicitly allow verbal confirmation by employers of the consumer's current, ongoing employment status, the Bureau would like to review this request further to ensure that such guidance would be consistent with the purposes of appendix Q and the ATR Final Rule. Similarly, with regard to the comment requesting clarification that a creditor's obligation to only consider a consumer's past and current and ongoing (and not continual) employment as proposed by the Bureau includes employment in contingent situations outside of the employee's or employer's control, the Bureau plans to review this issue further to determine whether such clarification to the existing appendix Q requirements is necessary, and how any such clarification would be framed. As discussed above, the Bureau believes appendix Q provides creditors with the ability to assess the employment and stability of income of employees generally and contract employees in particular.",

As revised, section I.A.3.a requires an examination of the consumer's past employment record and a verification of current, ongoing employment status as a method of assessing stability of income. Section I.A.3.b provides creditors with an additional method of assessing stability of income, and of meeting the ability to repay and qualified mortgage requirements, in the situation where a consumer changes jobs frequently."

In support of this proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that the intended purpose of appendix Q would not be served by requiring creditors to predict a consumer's employment status up to three years after application. The Bureau stated further that creditors should be required to analyze recent and current employment, along with any evidence in the applicant's documentation indicating whether employment is likely to continue. The Bureau therefore, proposed to add a note to section 1.B.1.a to make clear that creditors should not assume that a consumer's wage or salary income can be reasonably expected to continue if the verification of current employment includes an affirmative statement that the employment is likely to cease, such as a statement that indicates the employee has given (or been given) notice of employment suspension or termination. The Bureau stated however, that if the consumer's application and the employment confirmation indicate that the consumer is currently employed and provide no such indication that employment will cease, the Bureau believed, as reflected in the proposed note, that the creditor should be able to use that consumer's income without an obligation to predict whether or not that consumer will be employed on some future date."

One bank, for example, stated that while it supported the existing section i it recommended that, to mitigate potential fair lending risks based on age, the Bureau add a clarification that creditors should not ask consumers about future retirement plans, but should consider documented retirement benefits and payments if a consumer disclosed a plan to retire during the first three-year period. Another bank commenter similarly requested that the Bureau explicitly state, for fair lending reasons, that creditors are not expected to ask consumers if they plan to retire. This commenter also noted that it would be impracticable if not impossible to get documented benefits and payments if the consumer has yet to actually receive any retirement income and may not activate the source for up to a period of three years. The joint bank trade association commenter referred to above suggested adding language to section i of the notes indicating that effective income requirements for consumers planning to retire only applies to those who disclose such plans. A bank commenter, citing existing section ii of the notes, which prohibits creditors from asking consumers about possible future maternity leave, suggested, for fair lending reasons, that the Bureau add a clarification that creditors should not ask consumers about future medical leaves, and a joint bank trade association commenter suggested changing the term \u201cmaternity\u201d leave to \u201cmedical\u201d leave in section ii of the notes."

That section states further, however, that this assumption cannot be made by the creditor if a verification of current employment includes an affirmative statement that the consumer's employment is likely to cease&#8212;such as a statement that the consumer has given or been given notice of employment suspension or termination. The Bureau believes that, as revised by this final rule, section I.B.1 effectively sets out the analysis required of the creditor for assessing the continuance of consumer salary and wage income, and is consistent with the purposes of appendix Q.",

However, section I.B.1 already provides that creditors may assume that the consumer's salary or wage income can be reasonably expected to continue if the consumer's employer verifies current employment and income and does not indicate that employment has been, or is set to be terminated. Where no such appropriate verification is provided, the creditor must analyze the consumer's income and determine whether the consumer's income level can be reasonably expected to continue. In such cases, the Bureau believes that further analysis should be required of creditors, and that, as revised, section I.B provides creditors with an effective regulatory framework for carrying out that analysis.",

If, however, a consumer discloses a plan to retire during the first three-year period by making an affirmative statement of such plans, creditors should consider documented retirement benefits, Social Security payments, and other payments expected to be received in retirement. The Bureau similarly believes that the ATR Final Rule and appendix Q do not require creditors to ask whether a consumer may, in the future, take medical leave. The Bureau does not believe it is necessary, however, to amend appendix Q with specific statements in that regard.

This commenter noted that income from bonuses and overtime, commissions and self-employment can be variable and susceptible to significant declines from circumstances within and outside of the control of the consumer.

                                                "The Bureau is adopting the revisions to section I.B.2 regarding overtime and bonus income as proposed. The Bureau believes that the revisions proposed to section I.B.2.a, eliminating language requiring creditors to determine whether overtime and bonus income will continue, and substituting language that states that such income can be used if the consumer has received it for the past two years and documentation submitted for the loan does not indicate this income will likely cease, will facilitate creditor compliance and, as stated by a commenter, better access to credit for consumers who are dependent upon overtime and bonus income. At the same time the Bureau believes that the changes to this section otherwise further the purpose and intent of appendix Q and the qualified mortgage provision through clear requirements for a creditor assessment of the consumer's receipt of the overtime or bonus income for the previous two years, and a review of the loan documentation for indications that the income will likely cease. As some commenters noted, employers may not be willing to indicate if bonus income, for example, is likely to continue, and in the absence of employer confirmation, past history can be used as a predictive tool.", 
                                                "With regard to other proposed changes to section I.B.2.a raised by commenters, such as a suggestion to substitute language that there is no evidence in the loan file that the overtime or bonus income will not continue, or possible changes to address the potential impact of the two-year requirement on new employees who depend on overtime or bonus income, the Bureau believes that the Bureau's revisions strike the right balance between facilitating compliance and ensuring an adequate assessment of consumer income for purposes of the DTI and the ATR requirements. For example, as revised by this final rule, section I.B.2.a provides that bonus or overtime income may be used if the documentation in the loan file does not indicate that the consumer's overtime or bonus income \u201cwill likely cease,\u201d which is very similar to the language suggested by the commenter. To the extent that the commenter's proposed language would have a different effect, the Bureau believes that the final rule's approach provides clear, objective guidance to creditors that is consistent with the analysis required by the rest of appendix Q. As for the potential impact of the two-year requirement on new employees, the Bureau believes that current section I.B.2.b, as discussed further below, provides creditors with the ability to assess the overtime and bonus income of new employees.", 
                                                "As for comments on sections beyond the Bureau's specific proposed changes to section I.B.2.a, for example with regard to sections I.B.2.b and I.B.3, the Bureau does not believe any changes to those sections are warranted at this time. With regard to section I.B.2.b for example, the Bureau believes that section provides flexibility for creditors to justify and properly document the use of a period of overtime and bonus income of less than two years. The other requirements of section I.B.2.a (that documentation submitted for the loan does not indicate the overtime or bonus income will likely cease) and section I.B.3.a will continue to apply to the income analysis of the consumer. With regard to the comments on section I.B.3, suggesting a removal of that section and a reformatting into a new test in section I.B.2.c. for determining the amount of income to include in the DTI analysis, the Bureau appreciates the comment but believes that sections I.B.2, as amended by this final rule, and I.B.3, provide for a required income analysis consistent with the purposes and intent of appendix Q. Regarding the comments on section I.B.3.b, the Bureau will continue to review this section to determine if further clarification is needed with regard to a creditor determination of whether overtime or bonus income \u201cvaries significantly,\u201d but is not making any changes at this time. The Bureau needs additional information in order to fully assess whether this standard requires additional clarification for creditors in making the necessary appendix Q determinations, and whether possible alternative standards would be adequate."

It stated that while it agreed with the Bureau's explanation for the change, <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> that a Social Security benefit verification letter would more easily provide proof of the receipt of Social Security benefits and their continuance, the explanation did not provide a reason to eliminate the Federal tax return option. A bank commenter requested that I.B.11 be revised to permit Federal tax returns or other alternative documentation that verifies receipt of Social Security Income. A state banking association commented that in many cases applicants have lost or misplaced their award letters but that they can easily document and verify Social Security income through Federal tax returns and/or monthly bank statements. Another state banking association stated that the Federal tax return option would facilitate compliance. A state credit union commented that it was concerned that limiting verification to a benefit verification letter could facilitate discrimination. Another state credit union trade association, in stating its concern about the supposed elimination of the Federal tax return option, stated that it could delay the lending process as a result of consumers who cannot locate their Social Security benefit verification letter and who therefore need to request a copy from the SSA, resulting in a potential increased workload for the SSA. A credit union commenter, in recommending the Federal tax return option, stated that sole reliance on the Social Security benefit verification letter could pose a potential risk of fraud through a modification of the letter by the recipient before it is received by the lending institution.",

This commenter noted that tax returns may be useful to creditors to determine an applicable tax rate used to gross up non-taxable Social Security income, and that they may be needed to verify income received other than from Social Security. This commenter also stated its support for the Bureau's proposed clarification providing that Social Security income shall be assumed not to expire within three years, absent evidence of expiration, stating that it would reduce potential barriers to accessing credit for Social Security income recipients, while providing creditors clear guidance to mitigate fair lending risk.", 
                                                "A consumer group commenter stated that so long as the documentation requirements for Social Security income require that the Social Security benefit verification letter come directly from the SSA, this documentation is sufficient. It noted, however, that if the verification letter is delivered to the lender through a broker or originator working for the lender, this is not sufficient documentation as it may become a vehicle for falsification of income. The commenter therefore recommended that section I.B.11 be revised to require creditors to use either tax returns or bank statements showing the deposit of benefits into the bank account, in addition to requiring a verification letter\u2014where the verification letter cannot be obtained directly from the government payor. The commenter noted that the additional information will provide more substantial verification in a form that is still readily available to applicants. It concluded on this point that this approach will ensure that homeowners have easy access to needed income documentation without providing a means for public benefit documentation to be used to inflate income on a loan. This commenter also suggested, referring to section ii of the notes to section I.B.11 (which allows some portion of Social Security income to be \u201cgrossed up\u201d if deemed non-taxable by the IRS), that the Bureau should specify that grossing up of Social Security benefits should be done based on a tax bracket that is appropriate for the income received. It stated further on this point that the language currently in I.B.11 will lead to and support the existing practice of grossing up that allows, rather than prevents, many unaffordable loans, as many homeowners who receive Social Security benefits have their income grossed up to the top tax bracket."

The Bureau believes that the Social Security benefit verification letter provides the best method of verifying receipt of Social Security income by the consumer and its continuance. The Bureau understands the concerns expressed by various industry commenters regarding the potential limitation on compliance flexibility resulting from the removal of the supposed option to verify Social Security income through Federal tax returns. The Bureau notes, however, that section I.B.11 as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule required, in addition to income verification by the SSA or Federal tax returns, a complete copy of the current awards letter, and documented continuation of payments. The proposed revisions to section I.B.11 simplify these requirements by providing that one document\u2014the Social Security benefit verification letter\u2014satisfies all needs for documentation. A Federal tax return is of less value in demonstrating a consumer's continued receipt of Social Security income and would not be available for consumers who only recently began to receive Social Security benefits. Section I.B.11 as revised by the final rule specifically provides that if the Social Security benefit verification letter does not indicate a defined expiration date within three years of loan origination, the creditor must consider the income effective and likely to continue. The consumer's bank statements, suggested by some commenters as an alternative means to verify income, also are of less value in demonstrating continuance of receipt. The Bureau notes moreover that continuing to require the Social Security benefits letter to verify that such benefits are not likely to cease parallels the general requirement of employer verification of current, ongoing employment.", 
                                                "As far as the concern expressed by a commenter that the Social Security benefit verification letter could become a vehicle for falsification of income if not required to be received directly from the government payor\u2014and in which case it was suggested that tax returns or bank statements be required as additional verification\u2014the Bureau believes that effective due diligence by creditors will limit such a possibility. The Bureau expects that creditors will exercise the same due diligence against fraud with regard to their review of Social Security benefit verification letters that they apply in their review of any mortgage loan related documents submitted to them. With regard to the comments received expressing concern about consumers who are unable to locate their Social Security Benefit verification letters, it is the Bureau's understanding that benefit verification letters may be requested on-line or over the phone toll-free from the SSA or from a local SSA office.", 
                                                "Finally, with regard to the comment requesting that the Bureau put limitations on the grossing up of Social Security benefits (as permitted under section I.B.11 in some instances), the Bureau is not addressing that issue at this time, as this requires further review and consideration. Other commenters made suggestions for changes with regard to section II.E, Non-Taxable and Projected Income, and the gross-up rate allowed for non-taxable income generally (discussed later in this preamble) which, in addition to Social Security income, includes Federal government employee retirement income, State government retirement income, military allowances, as well as other types of income.

The documentation requirements in section I.D.4 included the requirement to provide a \u201cbusiness credit report for corporations and `S' corporations.\u201d The analysis of the financial strength of the business in section I.D.6 required that the creditor carefully analyze the \u201csource of the business's income\u201d and the \u201cgeneral economic outlook of similar businesses in the area.\u201d Following the publication of appendix Q the Bureau received inquiries from stakeholders concerning these requirements and also noted compliance difficulties and increased risk of litigation that could arise from them. Industry raised specific concerns that business credit reports can be expensive and difficult to obtain, and that a requirement to assess economic conditions for geographic areas can be both costly and difficult, as well as imprecise.",

The Bureau's first proposed amendment eliminated the requirement in current section I.D.4 that self-employed consumers provide a business credit report for corporations and \u201cS\u201d corporations. In proposing this amendment the Bureau stated that it recognized that business credit reports for many smaller businesses can be difficult or very expensive to obtain. The Bureau also stated its belief that while these reports may provide some valuable information for the purposes of an underwriting analysis, they are less suited to function as a requirement to determine income for self-employed consumers.",

In proposing this amendment the Bureau stated its belief that both of these requirements demand that the creditor engage in complex analysis without providing clarity concerning what types of evaluations are satisfactory for the purpose of complying with the rule.

A joint trade association commenter also suggested the deletion of the word \u201cguaranteed\u201d in this section, stating that it is unclear who would provide the guarantee, and that this is not in keeping with current practice.

A joint trade association and a bank also recommended expansion of the list of acceptable documentation in section II.B.3.b to include bank statements and other deposit accounts, as electronic payments are an increasingly common way to transfer money regularly between consumers."

A state bank association commenter noted that the Bureau's proposal retains the prohibition on using rental income paid by roommates, and that neither the rule nor appendix Q provides a definition of roommate or boarder. Stating that the provision to limit rental income to boarders is unnecessarily restrictive, the commenter requested that creditors be permitted to consider rental income received from roommates or boarders, provided such income is shown on the applicant's tax return.

The Bureau believes that rental income established through tax returns is the relevant factor for purposes of a DTI analysis, and that the distinction between the terms roommate and boarder is not relevant to that determination.

Specifically, one bank commenter urged the Bureau to expressly allow creditors to use GSE guidelines for any matter not addressed by appendix Q, as GSE guidance is widely used by industry and is consistent with prudent underwriting. This commenter stated, for example, that appendix Q does not specify how to annuitize assets, but that GSE guidance spells out how to annuitize a consumer's assets in qualifying a borrower. It also stated that, as a general matter, appendix Q should be revised to allow creditors to \u201cadd back\u201d amounts deducted from a borrower's income, consistent with a Fannie Mae worksheet. This commenter also noted several other specific areas where adoption of GSE guidance on add-backs was requested, for example, certain add-backs permitted by the GSEs with regard to section I.E. Income Analysis: Individual Tax Returns (IRS Form 1040); and with regard to section II.D.5. Rental Income, Analyzing IRS Form 1040 Schedule E. In addition this commenter recommended with regard to section II.E.4. Projected Income for a New Job, adoption of the GSEs' approach in assessing the projected income of certain teachers. A joint trade association commenter similarly recommended replacing, for reasons of clarity, appendix Q language in section I.B.12. Automobile Allowances and Expense Account Payments, with GSE guidance, and replacing language in sections I.E, F, G and H with a requirement to follow GSE guidelines for self-employed cash flow analysis, including the use of several GSE forms, and the adoption of GSE requirements in section II.E.2. Adding Non-Taxable Income to a Consumer's Gross Income. This commenter also recommended that appendix Q follow current GSE guidelines for an identified list of areas where it stated appendix Q is silent and where it was seeking additional clarity.", 
                                                        "Another bank commenter stated that there are instances in which the Appendix Q guidelines fail to reflect the level of detail needed to underwrite in the current mortgage market, and noted that the GSEs have adopted guidelines which provide greater detail and in some instances would be clearer and better suited to setting a regulatory requirement. This commenter encouraged the Bureau to review certain specifically identified sections of the GSE guidelines which it stated might provide more clarity than the present appendix Q rules. This commenter stated, however, that it was not recommending that the Bureau defer to the GSE guidelines which are subject to change without opportunity for notice and comment. It requested the Bureau review, for example, GSE guidelines with regard to \u201cincome from other sources\u201d in section I.B.1.b, giving as an example GSE guidelines on documenting of tips and foreign income.

As described above, many of these commenters suggested that the Bureau adopt, allow creditors to use, or look to GSE guidelines with regard to certain types of income and/or debt not specifically addressed by appendix Q in order to, in effect, provide a means for filling this gap.

Under Section 1026.43(e)(4), creditors who prefer federal agency or GSE underwriting rules can use those rules to obtain qualified mortgage status by ensuring that, among other things, their loans either are eligible for purchase or guarantee by the GSEs or to be insured or guaranteed by the agencies.",

Section I of appendix Q addresses consumer employment related income, and section I.B.1 sets out standards for analysis of salary, wage, and other consumer employment related income. Section I.B.1.b provides that income from sources other than salaries or wages \u201ccan be considered as effective\u201d when it is \u201cproperly verified and documented by the creditor.\u201d This provision sets the rule for the treatment of types of income whose treatment is not otherwise more specifically addressed by appendix Q. Likewise, section III.2.a provides as a general rule that recurring charges extending ten months or more for specified recurring obligations and \u201cother continuing obligations\u201d must be treated as debt.", 
                                                                        "In light of these circumstances, the Bureau has revised the introduction to appendix Q to make two points. First, where guidance issued by federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the Rural Housing Service, or issued by the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while operating under the conservatorship or receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or issued by a limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (collectively, Agency or GSE guidance) is in accordance with appendix Q, creditors may look to that guidance as a helpful resource in applying appendix Q. Thus, where only the broad principle contained in section I.B.1.b applies to a particular type of income, a creditor may look to Agency or GSE guidance that is in accordance with appendix Q's standards in determining whether that income has been properly documented and verified. For example, appendix Q does not specifically address additional steps a creditor might take to document and verify wage or salary income when it is earned from foreign sources and paid in foreign currency. Agency or GSE guidance may therefore be used to provide more specific standards with regard to verification or calculation of such income, as long as the guidance used is not inconsistent with the requirements of appendix Q. Similarly, where the treatment of a particular recurring obligation is not specifically addressed in appendix Q, the creditor may look to Agency or GSE guidance for purposes of determining how to assess that obligation, as long as that guidance is in accordance with the requirements of section III of appendix Q.", 
                                                                        "Second, in the event that there may be consumer situations that present questions that appendix Q simply does not presently address at all, the Bureau is adding language to the introduction providing that when the standards contained in appendix Q do not resolve the treatment of a specific kind of debt or income, the creditor may either (1) exclude the income or include the debt, or (2) treat the income or debt in accordance with guidance issued by the federal agencies or GSEs. The introduction makes clear, however, that the Bureau expects that the above-described default rule on excluding income and including debts and the optional safe harbor reliance on GSE or Agency guidance will be used sparingly. The introduction emphasizes that the creditor may not rely on Agency or GSE guidance to reach a resolution contrary to that provided by appendix Q's standards, even if the Agency or GSE guidance specifically addresses the particular type of debt or income but the appendix Q standards are more generalized. For clarity, the introduction provides a definition for when appendix Q's standards resolve the appropriate treatment of a specific kind of income or debt: where the appendix Q standards provide a discernible answer to the question of how to treat the debt or income. Under this definition, the Bureau believes that the use of the default rule or the optional safe harbor should only rarely be necessary. Thus, while the Bureau's revisions to appendix Q reflect commenters' concerns about the possibility of gaps in appendix Q, the Bureau emphasizes that as revised by this final rule, the introduction to appendix Q only allows creditors to use Agency or GSE guidance whenever appendix Q does not resolve how to treat a particular type of debt or income (or where such guidance is used in applying appendix Q consistent with its standards, as discussed above). Add-backs to income permitted by Agency or GSE guidance, for example, are not permitted by appendix Q except in accordance with its standards.", 
                                                                        "With regard to the request by some commenters for a major revision to appendix Q, including, for example, the removal of all requirements for subjective determinations, the Bureau believes that the revisions made by today's final rule, including the default rule and the optional safe harbor just described, will provide creditors with the means necessary to effectively carry out the analysis required by appendix Q. The Bureau will continue to review the implementation of appendix Q to ensure that creditors can readily comply with its requirements, but the Bureau believes that, with today's final rule, appendix Q currently meets that standard.", 
                                                                        "As discussed, some commenters suggested that the appendix Q requirements be revised to allow its integration into automated underwriting systems. After the Bureau's rules go into effect in January 2014, the Bureau, in reviewing the implementation of those rules, including the ATR Final Rule, will give additional consideration to the suggestions raised by these commenters. In the meantime, the Bureau believes that the temporary qualified mortgage provisions established by the ATR Final Rule should provide the needed flexibility for creditors.Regarding the comments suggesting that the Bureau treat appendix Q as guidance rather than as a regulation subject to notice and comment in order to respond to changing market conditions and industry practices, as previously stated, the Bureau \u201cdid not intend for appendix Q to function as a general flexible underwriting policy for assessing risk (as it is used by FHA in the context of insurance), and recognizes that the Bureau will not have the same level of discretion regarding the application of appendix Q.\u201d\n            Indeed, the Bureau believes that appendix Q could not fully serve its intended purpose of providing clarity and certainty as to the DTI determination were it treated as guidance. Moreover, the Bureau believes that appendix Q, particularly as clarified and revised by today's final rule, provides creditors with sufficient and appropriate standards for assessing the income and debt of consumers."

As noted, a joint trade association commenter supplemented its comment letter with a detailed chart of suggested changes to a variety of appendix Q sections both with regard to sections which were included in the Bureau's specific proposals, and sections that were not included. Various bank commenters stated that they endorsed the comments made by this commenter. Included in the joint trade association commenter's suggested changes of sections outside of the Bureau's proposals, for example, were changes to sections II.A. Alimony, Child Support, and Maintenance Income Criteria; II.C. Military Government Agency and Assistance and Program Income; and III.2. Debt to Income Ratio Computation for Recurring Obligations. As discussed above, this commenter also identified a list of areas where it stated appendix Q is silent and where it was seeking additional guidance. In its comment letter, this commenter also suggested a new quantitative test for determining the amount of consumer income to include in the DTI analysis, which it suggested not only be applied to overtime and bonus income, but other income analysis in appendix Q as well. Another Bank association commenter identified various areas with regard to sources of income that it stated appendix Q did not address, or did not adequately address, and for which it was seeking additional clarification, including, for example, asset amortization, stock options, capital gain income, foreign income, relocation earnings, and contractor and other irregular income situations. This commenter also requested additional guidance on section I.C. Consumers Employed by a Family Owned Business, and suggested changes with regard to section II.E. Non-Taxable and Projected Income to allow creditors to use a 25 percent \u201cgross-up\u201d rate for all non-taxable income. Other commenters that raised issues on sections outside of those sections that were the subject of the Bureau's specific proposals included a consumer commenter that recommended that the 12-month maximum for defining projected obligations (in section V.1) should be extended for loans with predictable repayment requirements and inflexible repayment terms, such as private student loans and student loan repayment programs."

                                                        "Several commenters suggested major revisions to appendix Q to address what the commenters viewed as standards that require creditors to make subjective determinations on a consumer's debt and income. For example, a joint trade association commenter stated that it was concerned that appendix Q mandates a calculation of DTI that will require lenders to establish essentially a manual underwriting process due to the numerous subjective determinations prescribed by the rule. It stated further that if qualified mortgages will comprise a significant fraction of mortgage originations, the proper calculation of DTI under appendix Q must be able to be incorporated into an automated underwriting system. The commenter therefore urged the Bureau to revise appendix Q to minimize the requirements for subjective determinations by lenders and to provide sufficient certainty to allow its integration into automated underwriting systems. It stated further that, for appendix Q to be an effective bright-line rule, the application of appendix Q should ideally deliver the same result regardless of the lender implementing it. However, the commenter noted, to do that would mean requirements for quantitative inputs, with supporting documentation, that eliminate any need for subjective determinations. This commenter concluded that appendix Q will be relied upon to verify the sufficiency of the lender's determination whether a loan is a qualified mortgage and should be able to be conclusively proven by written evidence, such as a loan file, in a court of law. This commenter supplemented its comment with a detailed chart with suggested revisions and comments on the Bureau's proposals, and on a number of other appendix Q provisions beyond the Bureau's specific proposals.", 
                                                        "A bank commenter echoed the comments of the joint trade association commenter that appendix Q needs to be revised to remove requirements for subjective determinations. This commenter stated, however, that it believes the structure and form of appendix Q can be retained while making tailored changes to its provisions as necessary to allow it to serve the intended purposes of appendix Q and the ATR Final Rule. A lender specializing in manufactured housing financing requested that the Bureau examine all of appendix Q with the goal of providing clarity and reducing litigation, and commented further that in order to incentivize lenders to gravitate towards qualified mortgages, the guidelines for making a qualified mortgage must be as objective as possible. To that end this commenter stated that should the Bureau ultimately decide not to remove the DTI requirements and appendix Q, it should amend certain sections of appendix Q that the commenter believes may not function properly as regulations.", 
                                                        "A GSE commenter recommended that the Bureau treat appendix Q as guidance rather than regulation that is subject to notice and comment rulemaking as it is the commenter's opinion that there are provisions of appendix Q that are not properly suited to be regulations. This commenter stated that such guidance could be revised as needed, and in relatively short order, in response to changing market conditions and industry practices, and that, in contrast, if appendix Q remains as a regulation subject to notice and comment it loses such flexibility. Another GSE commenter also recommended that the Bureau issue appendix Q in the form of a handbook or other written guidance, akin to the manner in which FHA provides underwriting standards to lenders, citing the Bureau's loss of flexibility and ability to respond promptly, if appendix Q remains a regulation subject to notice and comment rulemaking.", 
                                                        "A consumer group commenter stated that while it supported the Bureau's proposed clarifications to appendix Q it recommended that the Bureau go further to clarify it in a way that is consistent with automated underwriting. This commenter stated further that while manual underwriting is used by some lenders, lenders should not be required to underwrite in this manner simply to comply with the definitions of debt and income included in appendix Q.\n          "
