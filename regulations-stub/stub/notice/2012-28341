    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to, in effect, delay implementation of certain new mortgage disclosure requirements in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that would otherwise take effect on January 21, 2013. Instead, to avoid potential consumer confusion and reduce compliance burden for industry, the Bureau plans to implement these disclosures as part of the integrated mortgage disclosure forms proposed earlier this year, which combine certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Accordingly, this rulemaking exempts persons from complying with these mortgage disclosure requirements and provides that such exemptions are intended to last only until the integrated mortgage disclosure forms take effect.",

                "Although the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure was not included in the Affected Title XIV Disclosures in the TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal, the Bureau nevertheless received comment requesting that it delay implementation of this disclosure, as described above. Furthermore, as discussed above, the Board received similar requests from commenters on its 2011 Escrows Proposal, which is now the Bureau's responsibility.", 
                "The Bureau has considered the comments received by the Board and the Bureau and believes that, for the reasons given by the commenters and the reasons described in part II above, delaying implementation of the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure and coordinating such implementation with that of the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures is in the interest of industry and consumers alike. As discussed in part II above, the Dodd-Frank Act statutory requirements for the content of the Pre-Consummation Escrow Waiver Disclosure and the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure are the same, and the model forms proposed in the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal contained similar language for both disclosures. The Bureau tested language for the Pre-Consummation Escrow Waiver Disclosure at its consumer testing conducted in connection with the TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal and proposed to integrate this disclosure into the Closing Disclosure (which integrates the final TILA disclosure and the RESPA settlement statement).\n\n          Implementing the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure along with the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures will allow the Bureau to use feedback it has received from consumer testing conducted prior to the TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal, the comments on that proposal, and any consumer testing conducted subsequent to the proposal to harmonize the content and format of the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure, the Pre-Consummation Escrow Waiver Disclosure, and the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures. Consumers, therefore, would benefit from a more fully integrated and synchronized overall mortgage disclosure scheme, and industry would benefit from a more coordinated implementation of the overall mortgage disclosure scheme mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and implemented by the Bureau. The Bureau also notes that no commenters supported the finalization of the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure with the planned finalization of the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal on or before January 21, 2013, and no commenters supported allowing the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure to take effect by operation of law on that date.", 
                "In light of the considerations discussed above, including the comments submitted to the Board and the Bureau in support of a temporary exemption from compliance, the Bureau is modifying the proposed amendments to \u00a7 1026.1(c) to exempt persons from compliance with the Post-Consummation Escrow Cancellation Disclosure in addition to the Affected Title XIV Disclosures. Accordingly, the Bureau is adding a reference in \u00a7 1026.1(c)(5) and associated commentary to TILA section 129D(j)(1)(B)."

                "In addition, in the final rule the Bureau is making three technical changes to \u00a7 1026.1 and its commentary. First, in \u00a7 1026.1(a), reference has been added to reflect the implementation of certain provisions of RESPA. This technical change relates to the fact that the optional disclosure of appraisal management company fees and fees paid to appraisers under RESPA section 4(c) (as added by Dodd-Frank Act section 1475) is being implemented in Regulation Z, rather than Regulation X, by exempting persons from the disclosure requirements of that section.", 
                "Second, in comment 1(c)(5)-1, references have been added to Dodd-Frank Act sections 1098 and 1100A, which amend RESPA section 4(a) and TILA section 105(b), respectively, in addition to the proposed comment's reference to Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(f). This technical change reflects the fact that sections 1098 and 1100A of the Dodd-Frank Act also mandate the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures. Third, the Bureau has amended \u00a7 1026.1(a) to make clear that the Office of Management and Budget control number listed applies only to Bureau respondents."
