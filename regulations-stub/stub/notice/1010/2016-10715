                "In addition to amending the U.S. mail address, the final rule permits submission of Statements of Record via electronic means that are designated on the ILSA program page of the Bureau's Web site, www.consumerfinance.gov. The Bureau's Web site specifies uploading, file naming, and other requirements for electronic submissions. Electronic filing of Statements of Record will reduce the burden on filers and facilitate the Bureau's processing of submissions, by reducing costs spent on mailing and eliminating the time in transit for physical mailings and the time required for the Bureau to scan paper submissions. Filers may choose different submission options for each filing, only exercising the electronic option when it is beneficial. Further, the Bureau will achieve cost savings by receiving and processing filings in house rather than through a third-party contractor."
