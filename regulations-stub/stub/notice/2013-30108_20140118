    "abstract": "The Board, Bureau, FDIC, FHFA, NCUA, and OCC (collectively, the Agencies) are amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the official interpretation to the regulation. This final rule supplements a final rule issued by the Agencies on January 18, 2013, which goes into effect on January 18, 2014. The January 2013 Final Rule implements a provision added to TILA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd- Frank Act or Act) requiring appraisals for ``higher-risk mortgages.'' For certain mortgages with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate by a specified percentage, the January 2013 Final Rule requires creditors to obtain an appraisal or appraisals meeting certain specified standards, provide applicants with a notification regarding the use of the appraisals, and give applicants a copy of the written appraisals used. On July 10, 2013, the Agencies proposed amendments to the January 2013 Final Rule implementing these requirements. Specifically, the Agencies proposed exemptions from the rules for transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land; certain streamlined refinancings; and transactions of $25,000 or less.",

The loan is\u2014(1) not subject to the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in \u00a7 1026.43 as a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d (defined in \u00a7 1026.43(b)(1)), but (2) meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the Bureau's rules or, for loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). To explain further, loans enumerated in \u00a7 1026.43(a) are not \u201ccovered transactions\u201d under the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in \u00a7 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of \u00a7 1026.43, see, e.g., \u00a7 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) if they meet the Bureau's qualified mortgage criteria in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or \u00a7 1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD's rules. Nothing in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS."

Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal.

To explain further, loans enumerated in 12 CFR 1026.43(a) are not \u201ccovered transactions\u201d under the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in 12 CFR 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of 12 CFR 1026.43, see, e.g., 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in \u00a7 226.43(b)(1) if they meet the Bureau's qualified mortgage criteria in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or \u00a7 1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 226.43 if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD's rules. Nothing in \u00a7 226.43(b)(1) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS."

Moreover, the Bureau believes that about 90 percent of refinance transactions would have an appraisal provided to consumers because the creditor chose to have an appraisal and provided a copy due to the ECOA Valuations Rule. Thus, this exemption is likely to affect under 1,000 loans a year. The Agencies do not possess reliable, representative data on how many refinances will qualify for this exemption. However, to the extent refinances previously would not have been eligible for exemptions to this rule, the Agencies believe that going forward most such refinances will be restructured as qualified mortgages or otherwise to satisfy the criteria of this exemption for certain refinances. The Agencies used the same assumption for the supplemental proposal and did not receive any comments indicating otherwise. Accordingly, the Table below reflects this assumption. If this assumption did not hold and these refinances were not restructured, the Agencies believe that based on the 2011 data the final rules will cause at most a minor number of new appraisals&#8212;for approximately 1,200 loans.",

Thus, an appraisal requirement could hamper consumers' use of smaller home equity loans. The Agencies also stated their concern that a requirement for an appraisal with an interior inspection may pose a burdensome cost for consumers who seek to purchase lower-dollar homes using HPMLs that are not qualified mortgages; these tend to be low- to moderate-income (LMI) consumers who are less able to afford extra costs than higher-income consumers.",

Therefore, the Agencies examined the mean and median loan sizes for subordinate lien home improvement loans in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

The Bureau believed that receiving a written valuation might be helpful in informing a consumer's decision about whether to obtain the loan by making the consumer better aware of how the value of the home compares to the amount that the consumer might borrow. As a result, the Agencies requested comment in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule regarding whether certain conditions should be placed on the proposed smaller dollar loan exemption."

Eight commenters believed that the Agencies should either retain or reduce the $25,000 threshold. A national association of owners of manufactured homes, two affordable housing organizations, a consumer advocate group, and a policy and research organization generally recommended that, if the Agencies adopted the exemption, the exemption threshold should be no more than $25,000. They believed that a large percentage of the transactions affected were likely to be manufactured home transactions, although they urged the Agencies to apply the exemption equally to manufactured homes and site-built homes. A State banking trade association also supported an exemption for extensions of credit of $25,000 or less, citing increased costs and burdens associated with obtaining appraisals with interior inspections. An individual commenter urged the Agencies to reduce the threshold to $10,000, believing a $25,000 threshold could lead to significant monetary risk for consumers, particularly LMI consumers.", 
                                "All of the other commenters urged the Agencies to raise the threshold for the exemption. Eight State credit union trade associations, three credit unions, one national credit union trade association, one State manufactured housing association, and one small mortgage lender suggested that the threshold be raised to $50,000. Generally, these commenters supported the increase because they believed that the cost of an appraisal for transactions of lower amounts did not correspond to a meaningful benefit. They also supported regulatory relief to creditors. A credit union stated that a threshold under $50,000 may result in less lending to LMI consumers because lenders would not be willing to make the loans. A State credit union association stated that lenders may not make loans if the threshold is below $50,000 because the cost of originating and processing loans under that amount already exceeds origination fees, without a requirement for an appraisal with an interior inspection. Another credit union noted that it obtains evaluations, rather than appraisals, for transactions below $50,000.\n            \n          ",

A State credit union trade association commenter suggested that the threshold should be raised to $100,000 or, at a minimum, to $75,000. The commenter stated that requiring costly appraisals on smaller dollar HPMLs disproportionately hurts LMI consumers and consumers in rural areas, where appraisals can be costly and the wait time for appraisals, according to a member survey, is generally one-and-a-half to three months, but can be up to six months. A community banking trade association believed that, for loans below $100,000, the cost of an appraisal is high relative to the cost of the loan, but the credit risk to the bank is low. One community bank suggested a threshold of $35,000, noting that the average size of loans secured by a manufactured home (and not land) that are made by the bank is under $35,000. Another community bank believed that $40,000 was an appropriate threshold and expressed concerns about the cost of appraisals, especially in rural areas.",

A mortgage banking trade association stated that the threshold should be $100,000 because the Bureau's ability-to-repay rule permits creditors to apply higher points and fees for loans below $100,000.\n            Two of the commenters suggesting a $50,000 threshold asserted that doing so would make the exemption consistent with a threshold in the Bureau's Regulation Z rules under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) for different interest rate triggers.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The suggestions of some commenters focused on excluding subordinate lien transactions from the rule. A State credit union association believed $50,000 was an appropriate threshold because it would exclude from coverage of the HPML appraisal rules many subordinate lien transactions. This commenter believed that appraisals for subordinate lien loans taken concurrently with first lien loans were unnecessary because often an appraisal will have been performed for the first lien transaction. The commenter also believed that most home improvement loans are more than $25,000, so the proposed threshold could hinder the use of smaller home equity loans. The commenter asserted that the expense of the appraisal with an interior inspection could considerably raise the total costs of financing the home improvement loan.", 
                                "In addition, a State banking association and a financial holding company recommended exempting home equity loans from the rule. The financial holding company noted that, in the calculation to determine HPML status, the spread between APR and APOR is smaller for first lien loans than for subordinate lien loans (1.5 percentage points above APOR and 3.5 percentage points above APOR, respectively), and objected to an appraisal requirement for first lien home equity loans in particular. This commenter recommended that the Agencies raise the APR-APOR spread to 3.5 percentage points for all home equity loans. The State banking association argued that first lien home equity loans present very little credit risk.", 
                                "The Agencies also sought comment on whether the threshold for the smaller dollar loan exemption should be adjusted periodically for inflation and whether the adjustments should be annually or some other period.

A national association of owners of manufactured homes, two affordable housing associations, a consumer advocate group, and a policy and research organization believed that, if the Agencies adopted the exemption, consumers should be given at least the manufacturer's invoice for new manufactured home transactions, even if they fall under the threshold. These commenters believed that providing the invoice would be low cost, and yet would provide an important check on overvaluation. Another affordable housing organization believed that creditors in manufactured home transactions of $25,000 or less should be required to obtain replacement cost estimates performed by a trained, independent appraiser from a nationally-published cost service. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(viii).", 
                                "A community bank commenter asserted that consumers should receive a copy of the valuation used by the creditor as a condition to the exemption. A small mortgage lender suggested that a government-provided tax assessment would be an appropriate valuation to provide to consumers. This commenter argued that because municipalities already use tax assessments to determine property value for tax and insurance purposes, the assessments have been proven to be sufficiently reliable. The commenter contended that requiring more costly valuation methods as a condition of the exemption might prompt creditors to determine that the exemption is unduly burdensome and stop making these smaller dollar loans.", 
                                "An affordable housing organization suggested that, as a condition to the exemption (as well as other exemptions), creditors should be required to provide any valuation used to determine the security for the loan and suggested that creditors should be given flexibility to choose the appropriate valuation for the transaction. At the same time, the commenter recommended that a creditor should be required to obtain replacement cost estimates from a trained, independent appraiser and to provide these estimates to a consumer.", 
                                "The Agencies did not receive comments on a number of additional comment requests, including requests for information about the risks that smaller dollar loans could lead to high LTV loans; specific data on the costs and burdens associated with the exemption, especially for smaller institutions; and data on the extent to which creditors anticipate originating HPMLs of $25,000 or less that are not qualified mortgages."

The Agencies are also adopting the proposal to adjust the threshold annually, based on the percentage increase of the CPI-W. Official Staff Commentary for \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) is also adopted as proposed.", 
                                "Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-1 explains that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii), the threshold amount in effect during a particular one-year period is the amount stated in this comment for that period. Specifically, comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-1.i. provides that from January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the threshold amount is $25,000. Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-1 further provides that the threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the CPI-W that was in effect on the preceding June 1. The comment also states that, every year, the comment will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming one-year period after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. In addition, the comment states that any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. The comment provides the following example: if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.", 
                                "Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-2 clarifies that a transaction is exempt under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) if the creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation that is equal to or below the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation.", 
                                "Finally, comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-3 explains that a transaction does not meet the condition for an exemption under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) merely because it is used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan, unless the amount of the new extension of credit is equal to or less than the applicable threshold amount. The comment provides the following example: assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is greater than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. The comment states that, in these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless another exemption from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) applies. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2) and &#167; 1026.35(c)(4)(vii).", 
                                "For the reasons discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule as described in \u201cThe Agencies' Proposal,\u201d the Agencies believe that the exemption finalized in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. As discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies believe that the burden and expense of imposing the HPML appraisal requirements on HPMLs of $25,000 or less that are not qualified mortgages outweigh potential consumer protection benefits in many cases. As discussed above, no commenters objected to an exemption, and many commenters generally agreed with the Agencies' assessment of the costs versus the benefits of appraisals for these loans. Commenters also noted that the cost of the appraisals would be even higher in rural areas, due to the scarcity of appraisers and the potential for added time to locate and engage an appraiser.", 
                                "As noted, the Agencies received a number of comments on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule suggesting that the Agencies should raise the amount of the threshold. These commenters cited the cost of the appraisals and at least one commenter provided some information about the percentage of HPMLs made by the lender that are smaller dollar, but overall very little data was offered to support the various threshold suggestions. For example, despite the Agencies' requests for data, no commenters provided data indicating that a significant number of the smaller dollar loans they originate would not be qualified mortgages and thus would be subject to the HPML appraisal requirements absent an exemption.", 
                                "To inform the threshold determination, the Agencies again examined HMDA data. According to 2012 HMDA data, increasing the proposed threshold could substantially increase the proportion of HPMLs that would be exempted from the rule. For example, a $25,000 exemption would exempt 55 percent of conventional subordinate lien home improvement HPMLs from coverage and 37 percent of conventional subordinate lien home purchase HPMLs. In comparison, a $50,000 exemption would exempt 87 percent of conventional subordinate lien home improvement HPMLs and 70 percent of percent of conventional subordinate lien home purchase HPMLs.\n            The Agencies believe that increasing the threshold from $25,000 to, for example, $50,000, would exempt too large a proportion of HPMLs, such that the exemption would violate the intent of the statute to subject both first and subordinate lien loans to the appraisal requirements. The Agencies believe that a threshold of $25,000 appropriately exempts from the rule those smaller dollar loans that would benefit from the exemption, such as smaller dollar home improvement loans. Moreover, the Agencies believe creditors are generally better able to absorb losses that might be associated with a loan of $25,000 or less than loans of higher amounts.", 
                                "As discussed under \u201cPublic Comments,\u201d some commenters suggested exempting loans based on lien status or whether the loan is a home equity loan. For example, a State credit union association advocated for a threshold that would exclude most subordinate lien loan from the rules. A State banking association and a financial holding company recommended exempting home equity loans from the rule, particularly first lien home equity loans. The financial holding company noted that, in the calculation to determine HPML status, the spread between APR and APOR is smaller for first lien loans than for subordinate lien loans (1.5 percent above APOR and 3.5 percent above APOR, respectively). This commenter recommended that the Agencies raise the APR-APOR spread triggering HPML status to 3.5 percentage points for all home equity loans, whether first lien or subordinate lien.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that an exemption based on a monetary threshold rather than an exemption based on a loan's lien status or loan purpose (home equity versus home purchase, for example) is necessary to protect consumers and more consistent with the statute. The statute clearly indicates that HPMLs secured by a consumer's principal dwelling should be covered, whether home purchase or home equity, and whether first lien or subordinate lien. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 129H(f), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(f). In addition, the differing APR-APOR spreads for first lien and subordinate lien loans were set by statute. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See id.</em> Both first lien and subordinate lien home equity loans reduce equity in a consumer's home and can put consumers at financial risk; the Agencies believe that limiting this risk to consumers for both types of loans is appropriate. The Agencies also believe that consistency of the rule across these loan types will facilitate compliance.", 
                                "Regarding comments that the threshold should match those in other mortgage rulemakings, the Agencies decline to do so because the other mortgage rules are not comparable to the appraisal requirements. The $50,000 threshold in the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule referred to by two commenters relates to which APR-APOR spread applies in determining whether a loan is \u201chigh-cost.\u201d\n            Specifically, the $50,000 threshold is relevant only if the loan is secured by a first lien on a dwelling that is personal property. This threshold was intended to capture a very specific type of loan for an exemption from an entirely different set of rules. The Agencies therefore question the basis for applying the same threshold in establishing an exemption from the HPML appraisal rules.", 
                                "For similar reasons, the Agencies believe that setting the threshold at $100,000 to align with the $100,000 tier for permitting higher points and fees for qualified mortgages, as one commenter suggested, is not appropriate. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(3). The smaller dollar loan thresholds in that rule were crafted in the context of ensuring a consumer's ability to repay a mortgage, not for purposes of determining whether an appraisal should be performed for a particular transaction. Moreover, the $100,000 threshold is only the highest loan amount of five tiers of loan amounts for which higher points and fees are permitted at varying levels.", 
                                "For the reasons discussed above, therefore, the Agencies are maintaining the proposed $25,000 threshold in the final rule. The Agencies also are adopting the proposal to adjust the threshold for inflation every year, based on the percentage increase of CPI-W. As noted, commenters supported an annual adjustment for inflation. Also, as discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, inflation adjustments for other thresholds in Regulation Z are also annual, so the adjustment will provide for consistency across mortgage rules.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Conditions on the exemption.</em> The Agencies are finalizing the smaller dollar loan exemption with no conditions. Some commenters suggested providing alternative valuations to consumers as a condition to the smaller dollar loan exemption, including providing the consumer with an estimate of the value of the collateral property that the creditor relied on in making the credit decision. However, the Agencies believe that for HPMLs of $25,000 or less that are not qualified mortgages, the added burden or cost of a condition could deter lenders from making these loans, which could harm consumers. In addition, the Agencies believe that an unconditional exemption for transactions of $25,000 or less will be simpler and easier for creditors to apply, thus facilitating compliance and enhancing the utility of the exemption.", 
                                "One reason that the Agencies are not raising the exemption above $25,000 is the Agencies' concern that conditioning the exemption might then be necessary to ensure that the exemption both promotes the safety and soundness of creditors and is in the public interest. In the Agencies' view, arguments that neither an appraisal nor an alternative valuation need be obtained or provided to the consumer become increasingly less persuasive for transactions over $25,000, as larger amounts tie up greater amounts of home equity and losses become less easily absorbed by creditors. The Agencies deem it best not to add complexity by conditioning the exemption and believe that no conditions are needed at the level of $25,000 or less."

Notably, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was introduced by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2009 to provide refinance relief options to consumers following the steep decline in housing prices as a result of the financial crisis. The HARP program was expanded in 2011 and is currently set to expire in at the end of 2015.",

One reason for this is that, in currently available streamlined refinance programs, the value of the property securing the existing and refinance obligations does not determine borrower eligibility for the refinance.", 
                                "Generally, the principal concern under streamlined refinance programs is not whether the creditor or investor could in the near term recoup the mortgage amount by foreclosing upon and selling the securing property. The immediate goals for these loans are to secure payment relief for the borrower and thereby avoid default and foreclosure; to allow the borrower to take advantage of lower interest rates; or to restructure their mortgage obligation to build equity more quickly\u2014all of which reduce risk for creditors and investors and benefit consumers.", 
                                "The credit risk holder of the existing obligation might obtain a valuation other than an appraisal for the refinance to estimate LTV for determining the appropriate securitization pool for the loan. LTV as determined by this valuation can also affect the terms offered to the consumer. Sometimes an appraisal is required when the property is not standardized, or the credit risk holder of the existing obligation and the refinance loan does not have what it deems to be sufficient information about the property.",

These included comments from a credit union, a State credit union trade association, a national mortgage banking trade association, and a national real estate trade association. The commenters stated that the exemption would encourage and enable many consumers to refinance the balance of their mortgages through an abbreviated underwriting process that will save them time and money and help them restructure their debt and lower their interest rate or mortgage payment. The State credit union association commenter stated that an appraisal is not necessary for these types of transactions as the value of the home is not the factor driving the restructuring transaction. The national real estate trade association asserted that the cost of the appraisal would increase the costs to the consumer, especially in rural areas where there are fewer appraisers, with no offsetting benefit to the consumer.", 
                                "Three national appraiser organizations opposed the proposed exemption for streamlined refinances and urged the Agencies not to adopt it in the final rule. Two of these commenters asserted that a key component of a consumers' decision to refinance their loan is the market value of their home. A third national appraiser organization believed that the proposed exemption was unnecessary and inconsistent with what this commenter viewed as the Dodd-Frank Act's emphasis on risk management, particularly for HPMLs.", 
                                "The Agencies solicited comment on the circumstances in which an originator's assumption of \u201cput back\u201d risk on a refinance loan raises safety and soundness concerns, even where the owner or guarantor on the refinance loan remains the same. Two national appraiser organizations and a State HFA offered comments related to this question. The appraisal organizations commented that where a loan involves new risk to either government agencies or the taxpayers, an appraisal should be required. Generally, where new risk results from a transaction, an appraisal with an interior inspection should be required. These commenters added that, if the risk is already known or exists (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> is not new risk), an exterior inspection appraisal might be sufficient.", 
                                "The State HFA commented that the scope of the same \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d requirement should be expanded to include Federally-insured or -guaranteed streamlined refinancing transactions. The group suggested that the proposed language focused on the secondary market for mortgage loans rather than the Federal entities bearing the risk at the loan level. The Agencies understand that this State HFA has programs in which a Federally-insured or -guaranteed loan (such as by FHA or VA) might be refinanced and placed in a mortgage revenue bond guaranteed by the HFA. The State HFA expressed concerns that under this arrangement, the loan might not meet the same \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d criteria of the proposed refinance exemption because the HFA would be a new guarantor at the secondary market level. However, the State HFA pointed out that the refinance loan continues to be insured by FHA or guaranteed by VA at the loan level.", 
                                "A State credit union organization believed that exempting refinances in which the \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d of the refinanced loan also is the \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d of the existing loan would reduce time and transaction costs. A State banking trade association commented in the context of balloon mortgages that streamlined refinances with the same \u201cowner and guarantor\u201d typically have lower costs than a refinance with another creditor. The national trade association that represents creditors believed that the language of the proposal requiring that the \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d be the same would exclude loans that are originated by the servicer or subservicer on the original obligation, and requested clarification to allow those entities to originate streamlined refinances and still be eligible for the exemption.",

Two national organizations representing appraisers commented that when refinanced loans are not sold to the GSEs or insured or guaranteed by a government agency, creditors are likely to order appraisals with interior inspections because of the increased risk to the creditor.",

These commenters believed that balloon mortgages can be an affordable option and serve an important role in helping consumers retain their homes. For similar reasons, one of the State credit union associations also supported eliminating the proposed prohibition on interest-only payments. A State banking trade association urged the Agencies to consider including Balloon Payment Qualified Mortgages\n            in the proposed expanded definition for qualified mortgages, arguing that these types of mortgages undergo rigorous underwriting procedures similar to those required under the general qualified mortgage provisions.\n            \n          ", 
                                "In addition to the restrictions on exempt refinancings that the Agencies proposed, one State bank commenter recommended that the proceeds from the refinance be used to pay both principal and accrued interest since the majority of refinance loans today include the accrued interest of the refinanced loan into the new loan amount. This commenter stated that including accrued interest would not adversely affect the consumer and could be beneficial if the consumer does not have the cash to pay the amount.", 
                                "An affordable housing organization commenter stated that any streamlined refinance resulting in higher payments, higher interest rates or longer loan terms for the consumer should not be exempt. This commenter also believed that previously refinanced loans should not be exempt to prevent an accumulation of high fees from eroding the consumer's equity.", 
                                "A State credit union association commenter opposed limiting the amount of points and fees that may be financed on an exempt refinance transaction. This commenter pointed out that a points and fees test applies to \u201chigh-cost\u201d mortgages in Regulation Z\n            and asserted that it is not necessary to include point and fee caps as part of HPML appraisal rules. This commenter also argued that to do so would create more regulatory confusion for consumers and financial institutions.",

The national mortgage banking association commenter recommended that the Agencies adopt the benefits test used by the GSEs for HARP loans, which requires that the new loans put borrowers in a better position by reducing their payments or moving them from a risky loan structure.\n            Similarly, the affordable housing organization commenter stated that only streamlined refinance transactions clearly lowering the consumer's risk should be exempt. On the other hand, a State credit union association commenter opposed introducing additional limits on the exemption, such as requiring that the borrower have made timely payments for a specified period or that the consumer \u201cbenefit\u201d from the transaction in some way defined in the regulations.", 
                                "The Agencies also requested comments on whether the exemption for refinance loans should be conditioned on the creditor obtaining an alternative valuation and providing a copy to the consumer three business days prior to closing. The Agencies further asked whether obtaining and providing an alternative valuation would better position the consumer to consider alternatives, and whether consumers seeking to refinance their existing first lien loan typically need or want to consider alternatives to refinancing. Lastly, the Agencies generally requested comment and data on whether a condition on the exemption is necessary.", 
                                "Four commenters\u2014a State credit union association, a national community bank trade association, a national mortgage banking association, and a financial holding company\u2014affirmatively opposed requiring creditors to obtain an alternative valuation to qualify their refinance loans for the refinance exemption from the HPML appraisal rules. Commenters stated that doing so would hinder the refinancing process and increase the time and expense of these transactions unnecessarily. These commenters did not believe that a significant benefit exists in giving an alternative valuation when consumers are not increasing the amount of their debt or changing the collateral.", 
                                "Comments from a State bank and a State credit union association suggested that if an alternative valuation were required, creditors should be able to rely on an existing appraisal to the extent permitted by existing Federal appraisal regulations and the interagency appraisal guidelines,\n            which allow for using an existing appraisal prepared for another financial institution. A credit union commenter and a State credit union association commenter suggested that if an alternative is required, a \u201cdrive-by\u201d appraisal or comparable market analysis to ensure that the home still stands and is in reasonable condition is prudent when modifying or restructuring debt to reduce foreclosures and further delinquencies.", 
                                "Three national appraiser organizations and an affordable housing organization recommended that, at minimum, an alternative valuation to an appraisal with an interior inspection should be required so that consumers are better informed. The appraiser group commenters recommended that creditors obtain replacement cost estimates or other less costly services provided by appraisers, such as desktop appraisals. One appraiser group generally asserted that the consumer should be made aware of what type of valuation service was performed and by whom.", 
                                "No commenters provided data relevant to whether requiring an alternative valuation as a condition of the proposed refinance exemption would be necessary or beneficial.", 
                                "In the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies recognized that estimates of value may not always be required by Federal law or investors. For example, some creditors are not subject to the appraisal and evaluation requirements that apply to Federally regulated financial institutions\n            under FIRREA and, therefore would not be required to obtain a FIRREA-compliant valuation on a \u201cno cash out\u201d refinance. Thus, the Agencies requested comment on the extent to which either appraisals or other valuation tools such as AVMs or broker price opinions (BPOs) are used in connection with streamlined refinances\u2014by non-depositories not covered by FIRREA in particular. Only one commenter, a national appraiser organization, responded to this question, stating that BPOs are not used in refinance transactions and, in fact, are illegal in many states. Moreover, this commenter pointed out that GSEs and other government agencies prohibit using BPOs in refinancing, and use their own AVMs to waive appraisal requirements when appropriate."

Consistent with the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies decline to adopt an exemption for all refinance loans, as a few commenters on the 2012 Proposed Rule suggested. The appraisal rules in TILA Section 129H apply to \u201cresidential mortgage loans\u201d that are higher-priced and secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. TILA section 129H(f), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(f). The term \u201cresidential mortgage loan\u201d includes refinance loans.\n            Accordingly, the Agencies believe that an exemption for all HPML refinances would be overbroad. For example, in refinance transactions involving additional cash out to the consumer, consumer equity in the home can decrease significantly, increasing risks, so the Agencies do not believe an exemption from this rule would be appropriate.", 
                                "As stated in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies believe that a narrower exemption for certain types of HPML refinance loans, generally consistent with the program criteria for streamlined refinances under GSE and Federal government agency programs, is in the public interest and will promote the safety and soundness of creditors. The Agencies recognize that, by reducing the risk of foreclosures and helping borrowers better afford their mortgages, streamlined refinancing programs can contribute to stabilizing communities and the economy, both now and in the future. Streamlined HPML refinance transactions can help borrowers who are at risk of default in the near future, as well as those who might not default in the near term but could benefit by refinancing into a lower rate mortgage for considerable cost savings over time. The Agencies also recognize that streamlined refinancing programs assist credit risk holders to manage their risks. Originating HPML refinances that are beneficial to consumers can be important to creditors to ensure the continuing performance of loans on their books and to strengthen customer relations. For investors in these loans, the streamlined refinances can reduce financial risks associated with potential defaults and foreclosures.", 
                                "As a general matter, the purpose of the exemption for certain refinance transactions is to facilitate transactions that can be beneficial to borrowers even though they are HPMLs. When the consumer is not obtaining additional funds to increase the amount of the debt (other than the costs related to the refinancing), and the entity that will hold the credit risk of the refinance loan is already the credit risk holder on the existing loan, the benefit from obtaining a new appraisal may be insufficient to warrant the additional cost. The Agencies believe that an exemption from the HPML appraisal rules for certain HPML refinances can ensure that the time and cost generated by new appraisal requirements are not introduced into certain HPML transactions\u2014namely, those that are not qualified mortgages but are part of programs designed to help consumers avoid defaults and improve their financial positions, as well as help creditors and investors avoid losses and mitigate credit risk."

The Agencies are adopting this requirement as a condition of obtaining the refinance loan exemption from the HPML appraisal rules because the Agencies believe that this restriction is important to ensuring that the exemption promotes the safety and soundness of financial institutions. An exemption for streamlined refinances from the HPML appraisal rules can help creditors more readily refinance loans to mitigate risk by placing consumer in loans with better terms. Decreased default risk for all parties is also in the public interest.",

For example, the Agencies are concerned that the agreements associated with loans securitized in a private-label mortgage-backed security (MBS) may include parties identified as \u201cguarantor\u201d and \u201cowner,\u201d but such parties do not bear the \u201ccredit risk\u201d as defined in this final rule. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(1)(ii).", 
                        "In GSE securitizations, a GSE bears all of the credit risk because it either \u201cowns\u201d a loan and holds the loan in portfolio, or \u201cguarantees\u201d the loan by placing the loan in an MBS and guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to investors. Some of these loans might have private mortgage insurance, but the GSE is the beneficiary.", 
                        "By contrast, in private-label securitizations, the credit risk is spread among multiple parties; for example, the originating credit might retain some residual risk (and will be required to for \u201cQualified Residential Mortgages\u201d\n            ), the other MBS investors bear certain risks depending on the \u201ctranche\u201d or risk tier of the investor, and private mortgage insurers or bond insurers also may guarantee some losses. Typically, when a loan in an MBS is refinanced, the loan will not remain in the same MBS.\n            The Agencies believe that where entities take on material new credit risk with a refinance, safety and soundness and the public interest are not served by exempting that refinance from the HPML appraisal rules.", 
                        "At the same time, the Agencies recognize that the private-label securitization market could involve MBS structures that include an entity that provides a guarantee similar to that guarantee provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac today. Therefore, the criterion in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) is intended to address not only GSE securitizations, but also any equivalent private-label structures that meet the requirements of the exemption. The Agencies believe that private creditor refinance transactions may have similar benefits to consumers, creditors, and credit markets as those under GSE and government agency programs. In particular, the Agencies believe that the central feature of public streamlined refinance programs&#8212;the credit risk holder on the existing obligation remains the credit risk holder on the refinance loan&#8212;must be in place in any private streamlined refinances that would be entitled to an exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements.", 
                        "Accordingly, the Agencies are not adopting proposed comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)-1, which was intended to help clarify the meaning of the terms \u201cowner\u201d and \u201cguarantor.\u201d Instead, the Agencies are adopting a revised version of this comment, re-numbered comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1, that focuses on what it means to hold the credit risk on a loan for purposes of the exemption. Specifically, comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1 states that the requirement that the holder of the credit risk on the existing obligation and the refinance loan be the same applies to situations in which an entity bears the financial responsibility for the default of a loan by either holding the loan in its portfolio or guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to investors in a mortgage-backed security in which the loan is pooled. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(1)(ii) (defining &#8220;credit risk&#8221;). The comment states that, for example, a credit risk holder could be a bank that bears the credit risk on the existing obligation by holding the loan in the bank's portfolio. Another example of a credit risk holder would be a government-sponsored enterprise that bears the risk of default on a loan by guaranteeing the payment of principal and any interest on a loan to investors in a mortgage-backed security. Finally, the comment clarifies that the holder of credit risk under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) does not mean individual investors in an MBS or providers of private mortgage insurance.", 
                        "Consistent with the proposal (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> proposed comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)-1), the Agencies do not intend that individual investors in an MBS be considered credit risk holders under this exemption criterion. The risks held by investors in these arrangements are too disparate for these investors to be considered credit risk holders under the final rule.", 
                        "The Agencies also do not intend private mortgage insurers\u2014either at the loan level or MBS level (as bond insurers, for example)\u2014to be credit risk holders under the final rule because the types of losses they guarantee may vary for each loan by contract, as may their valuation standards for collateral underlying loans they insure. These factors are subject to private contractual arrangements that are not publicly available. Even if the refinance loan were insured by the same private mortgage insurance provider that insured the existing obligation, the types of losses guaranteed by this provider on the refinance loan might be different from those guaranteed on the existing loan and a new party to the refinance transaction could be taking on significant new credit risk.", 
                        "In new comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-2, the final rule provides two illustrations of refinance situations in which the credit risk holder would be considered the same for both the existing obligation and the refinance loan. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive. In the first illustration, the existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a bank, thus the bank holds the credit risk. The bank arranges to refinance the loan and also will hold the refinance loan in its portfolio. If the refinance transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance loan. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the bank arranged to refinance the loan directly or indirectly, such as through the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-2.i.", 
                        "In the second illustration, the existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a GSE, thus the GSE holds the credit risk. The GSE approves a refinance of the existing obligation by the servicer of the loan and immediately purchases the refinance loan. The GSE pools the refinance loan in a mortgage-backed security guaranteed by the GSE; thus, the GSE continues to hold the credit risk on the refinance loan. If the refinance transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance loan. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the existing obligation were refinanced by the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation (acting as a \u201ccreditor\u201d under \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)) or by a different creditor. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-2.ii.", 
                        "As noted, one commenter requested clarification about whether a servicer or subservicer could originate a refinance that would be eligible for the exemption. This commenter expressed concerns that the requirement that the \u201cowner or guarantor\u201d remain the same would prohibit this for exempt refinances. Comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-2.ii is intended to clarify that servicers or subservicers may originate refinances that are exempt if the credit risk holder on the original obligation remains the credit risk holder on the refinance loan.", 
                        "In new comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-3, the final rule notes that a creditor may at times make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a &#8220;forward commitment.&#8221; The comment clarifies that a refinance loan with a forward commitment does not satisfy the requirement of &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) if the loan will be acquired by another person pursuant to a forward commitment, such that the credit risk on the refinance loan will transfer to a person who did not hold the credit risk on the existing obligation. This comment is intended to ensure that creditors cannot evade the HPML appraisal requirement by refinancing a loan on which they hold the credit risk but then bear the credit risk on the refinance loan for only a short interim period before transferring the loan to a new longer-term credit risk holder.", 
                        "Overall, the Agencies believe that the benefits of an appraisal with an interior inspection are less clear where the credit risk holder remains the same for both transactions. The credit risk holder of the existing obligation is more likely to be familiar with the property securing the transaction or relevant market conditions than a new credit risk holder. This knowledge could have resulted from the credit risk holder having evaluated property valuation documents when taking on the original credit risk, as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring. By contrast, when the credit risk holder of the refinance loan is not also the credit risk holder of the existing loan, the refinance loan involves new risk to the new credit risk holder of the refinance loan; here, safety and soundness would be better served by an appraisal in conformity with USPAP and in compliance with FIRREA that includes an interior inspection.\n            \n          ", 
                        "As stated in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies generally believe that requiring that the credit risk holder remain the same makes it unnecessary to require that the \u201ccreditor\u201d (as defined under \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)) also be the same for both the existing obligation and the refinance loan. Under Regulation Z's definition of \u201ccreditor,\u201d the creditor will not necessarily be the credit risk holder for both the existing and the refinance loans. By allowing the creditor to be different (as long as the underlying credit risk holder on the loan remains the same), the final rule provides consumers with greater ability to obtain a more beneficial loan without having to obtain an appraisal.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(</em> 2 <em data-original=\"E-03\">)&#8212;government agency programs.</em> Section 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) provides that a refinance loan meeting the other criteria for the exemption (&#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(B) and (C)) could also qualify for the exemption if the Federal government agency that insured or guaranteed the existing obligation also insures or guarantees the refinance loan.", 
                        "Typically these government agency loans would be qualified mortgages under the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule;\n            they also potentially could be qualified mortgages under the qualified mortgage regulations of each of these agencies, once issued.\n            As qualified mortgages, they would be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules under the exemption for qualified mortgages in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i).", 
                        "The Agencies are adopting a separate provision for Federal government agency loans for several reasons. First, \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) is intended to ensure that the HPML appraisal rules will not disrupt government refinance programs, which the Agencies do not believe was Congress's intent. This provision is meant to clarify the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, which was intended to exempt refinances consistent with existing Federal government agency streamlined refinance programs.", 
                        "Second, as noted, Federal government agency loans have valuation requirements that the affected Federal agency has deemed sufficiently protective of its interests. The Agencies do not believe that Congress intended that the HPML appraisal rules should override the established requirements and standards of Federal government agencies for their mortgage programs. Moreover, the requirements of Federal mortgage programs, including the valuation requirements, are transparent and established by publicly accountable entities. In this regard, refinances retaining FHA insurance, for instance, are distinguishable from loans with the same loan-level private mortgage insurer, whose valuation and other standards are determined by private contracts. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1 and accompanying section-by-section analysis.", 
                        "Third, the terms \u201cinsured\u201d and \u201cguaranteed\u201d are commonly used to describe the loan-level protections afforded by HUD, VA, and USDA (including RHS) against losses due to default; however, the Agencies are concerned that these terms might not be readily understood to be a part of the same credit risk holder provision under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>). As noted, one commenter indicated, for example, that confusion might exist about whether a loan with FHA insurance or a VA guaranty that was refinanced into a loan also insured or guaranteed by FHA or VA could qualify for the exemption if the secondary market participants differed on the two loans. The Agencies therefore wish to be clear that these loans would still qualify for the exemption because the loan-level credit risk holder remains the same.", 
                        "Finally, these loans might not always be \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d under the Bureau's ATR rules because they might not meet all of the criteria required for that status.\n            The Agencies do not believe that layering the HPML appraisal requirements onto Federal government agency loans provides sufficient benefits to warrant the drawbacks of burdening consumers and creditors in these transactions. A Federal government agency has already determined what the appropriate valuation requirements should be and, as previously discussed, these mortgage programs are intended to provide needed relief to borrowers and to mitigate credit risk for creditors. The Agencies thus believe that the safety and soundness of creditors and the public interest is served by allowing these transactions to go forward under valuation rules established by the Federal agency insuring or guaranteeing the loan.", 
                        "Relationship to the 2013 ATR Final Rule. The Agencies recognize that in the near term, most Federal government program and GSE streamlined refinance loans will be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules as \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i). Under the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, loans eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS (based solely on criteria related to the consumer's ability to repay) are subject to the general ability-to-repay rules (found in \u00a7 1026.43(c)). <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(4)(ii). However, if they meet certain criteria,\n            they are considered &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; entitled to either a rebuttable or conclusive presumption of compliance with the general ability-to-repay rules, depending on the loan's interest rate.\n            \n            <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(1), (e)(4).\n\n            As qualified mortgages, they are exempt from the HPML appraisal rules. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(i).", 
                        "First, the 2013 ATR Final Rule limits the qualified mortgage status of loans purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the special rules of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4). These loans will not be eligible to be qualified mortgages if consummated after January 10, 2021, unless they meet the criteria of another type of qualified mortgage. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(c)(4)(iii)(B). Second, again, GSE-eligible loans and loans eligible to be insured or guaranteed under a HUD, VA, USDA, or RHA program\n            are &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; only if they meet certain criteria&#8212;they must not result in negative amortization or provide for interest-only or balloon payments; have a loan term exceeding 30 years; or points and fees above to three percent of the loan amount (with a higher cap for loans under $100,000).\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Agencies believe that the refinance exemption under the HPML appraisal rule should nonetheless cover Federal government agency and GSE streamlined refinance loans. The exemption is appropriate here in part because the GSEs and Federal government agencies have valuation requirements to protect their interests that are transparent and publicly available. In this regard, an important distinction between the qualified mortgage provisions addressing GSE and Federal government agency loans and the HPML refinance exemption criteria in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and (<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) is that qualified mortgage status may be conferred on loans &#8220;eligible&#8221; to be purchased by a GSE or insured or guaranteed by a Federal government agency; by contrast, the HPML refinance exemption from the HPML appraisal rules requires that these loans actually are purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or continue to be insured or guaranteed by a Federal government agency. In this way, compliance with valuation requirements established by these entities is assured as part of the justification for the exemption."

                        "The Agencies also are adopting without change proposed comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(B)-1 which states that, under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(B), a refinancing must provide for regular periodic payments that do not: result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2), or result in a balloon payment. The comment thus clarifies that the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. The comment further states that, except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. The comment cross-references comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4 of the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule for an explanation of the term &#8220;substantially equal.&#8221;\n            The comment also clarifies that a single-payment transaction is not a refinancing meeting the requirements of &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) because it does not require &#8220;regular periodic payments.&#8221;", 
                        "Where these features are present in an HPML that is not a qualified mortgage, the Agencies believe that the information provided by a real property appraisal in conformity with USPAP that includes an interior property inspection is important for the safety and soundness of creditors and the protection of consumers. Additional equity may be needed to support a loan with negative amortization, for example, and the risk of default might be higher for loans with interest-only and balloon payment features.", 
                        "The Agencies recognize that consumers who need immediate relief from payments that they cannot afford might benefit in the near term by refinancing into a loan that allows interest-only payments for a period of time. However, the Agencies believe that a reliable valuation of the collateral is important when the consumer will not be building any equity for a period of time. In that situation, the consumer and credit risk holder may be more vulnerable should the property decline in value than they would be if the consumer were paying some principal as well.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Agencies also recognize that, in most cases, balloon payment mortgages are originated with the expectation that a consumer will be able to refinance the loan when the balloon payment comes due. These loans are made for a number of reasons, such as to control interest rate risk for the creditor or as a wealth management tool, usually for higher-asset consumers. Regardless of why a balloon mortgage is made, however, there is always risk that a consumer will not be able to make the balloon payment or refinance, with potentially significant consequences for the consumer and the credit risk holder if something unexpected happens and the consumer cannot do so.", 
                        "The Agencies note that the GSE and government streamlined refinance programs described above do not allow these features, in part because helping a consumer pay off debt more quickly is one of the goals of these programs.\n            In addition, the prohibition on risky features for this exemption is consistent with provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act reflecting congressional concerns about these loan terms. For example, in Dodd-Frank Act provisions regarding exemptions from certain ability-to-repay requirements for refinancings under HUD, VA, USDA, and RHS programs, Congress similarly required that the refinance loan be fully amortizing and prohibited balloon payments.\n            The final rule also is consistent with a provision in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule that exempts the refinancing of a \u201cnon-standard mortgage\u201d into a \u201cstandard mortgage\u201d from the requirement that the creditor make a good faith determination of the consumer's ability to repay the loan. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(d). To be eligible for this exemption from the ability-to-repay rules, the refinance loan must, among other criteria, not allow for negative amortization, interest-only payments, or a balloon payment. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(d)(1)(ii). The Agencies believe that these statutory provisions and program restrictions reflect a judgment on the part of Congress, government agencies, and the GSEs that refinances with negative amortization, interest-only payment features, or balloon payments may increase risks to consumers and creditors.", 
                        "The Agencies are concerned that negative amortization, interest-only payments, and balloon payments are loan features that may increase a loan's risk to consumers as well as to primary and secondary mortgage markets.\n            Thus, in the Agencies' view, permitting these non-qualified mortgage HPML refinances to proceed without a real property appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA that includes an interior inspection would not be consistent with the Agencies' exemption authority, which permits exemptions only if they promote the safety and soundness of creditors and are in the public interest.", 
                        "As noted, several commenters requested that the prohibition on balloon payments for exempt refinances be eliminated in the final rule. One commenter also requested that the prohibition on interest-only payments be eliminated. For the reasons stated, however, the Agencies continue to believe that the prohibitions on balloon payments and interest-only payments are appropriate. In addition, the Agencies note that some of the public comments in support of eliminating the balloon payment prohibition suggested uncertainty about whether \u201cballoon payment qualified mortgages\u201d under the Bureau's ability-to-repay rules would be exempt. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(6) and (f). As set out in the section-by-section analysis of the exemption for qualified mortgages under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(i), both temporary balloon payment mortgages under &#167; 1026.43(e)(6) and balloon payment qualified mortgages under &#167; 1026.43(f) are exempt from the HPML appraisal rules under the exemption for qualified mortgages.

Based on comments, particularly a comment recommending that the Agencies clarify that proceeds could be used to pay accrued interest, the Agencies are revising this provision of the proposal.",

Thus, revised \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(C) incorporates concepts and guidance from \u00a7 1026.23(f)(2), which sets out the portion of a refinance that is rescindable\u2014namely, the portion that exceeds \u201cthe unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing or consolidation.\u201d The Official Staff Commentary associated with \u00a7 1026.23(f)(2) clarifies, in pertinent part, that \u201ca new advance does not include amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. These amounts would include section 1026.4(c)(7) charges (such as attorney's fees and title examination and insurance fees, if bona fide and reasonable in amount), as well as insurance premiums and other charges that are not finance charges. (Finance charges on the new transaction\u2014points, for example\u2014would not be considered in determining whether there is a new advance of money in a refinancing since finance charges are not part of the amount financed.)\u201d Comment 23(f)(2)-4.",

Accrued interest is any interest that has accumulated since the consumer's last payment of principal and interest, but that the borrower has not yet paid and has not been capitalized into the principal balance. Accrued interest exists when a consumer makes a payment on the existing obligation on October 1st, for example, but then refinances into a new loan on October 20th. In this case, interest would have accumulated between the payment made on October 1st and the date of the refinance. However, the consumer would not have paid that accrued interest and the creditor normally would not have capitalized that interest into the principal balance.", 
                        "Revised comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(C)-1 further provides that guidance on the meaning of refinancing costs is available in comment 23(f)-4. Finally, consistent with proposed comment 35(c)(2)(vii)(C)-1, the revised comment clarifies that, if the proceeds of a refinancing are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a refinancing under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) from the appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c).", 
                        "The Agencies view the limitation on the use of the refinance loan's proceeds as necessary to ensure that the principal balance of the loan does not increase, or increases only minimally. This in turn helps ensure that the consumer is not losing significant additional equity and that the holder of the credit risk is not taking on significant new risk, in which case an appraisal with an interior inspection to assess the change in risk could be beneficial to both parties.",

The Agencies believe that consistency across mortgage rules can help facilitate compliance and ease compliance burden.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Other conditions.</em> Consistent with the proposal, the Agencies are not adopting additional conditions on the types of refinancings eligible for the exemption from the HPML appraisal rules. In this way, the Agencies seek to maintain flexibility for creditors and investors to adapt and change their borrower eligibility requirements and other requirements for streamlined HPML refinances to address changing market environments and factors that may be unique to their programs.", 
                        "Regarding comments supporting a requirement that the refinance result in a \u201cbenefit\u201d to the consumer, such as a lower payment, a lower rate, or shorter term, the Agencies continue to believe that it is unclear how the existence of a borrower benefit in the new transaction relates to what type of valuation should be required. The Agencies are also not adopting a limitation on the points and fees that may be refinanced. Congress addressed loan cost parameters for the appraisal rules by defining HPMLs as loans with interest rates above APOR by a certain percentage. The Agencies are concerned that introducing a points and fees cap into the rule could create confusion and compliance difficulties, given the statutory points and fees caps implemented in other overlapping regulations, such as regulations regarding qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages, noted earlier.", 
                        "Other protections in the final rule ensure that the borrower, creditor and investor would be taking on no new material credit risk, which the Agencies believe should be the primary determinant of whether an appraisal with an interior inspection should be required. The Agencies also believe that borrower benefits can be difficult to define because they can be highly transaction-specific. For example, a higher rate might result in a benefit to a consumer where the higher rate results from extending the loan term to lower the consumer's payments. Here, the benefit to the consumer is an improved ability to stay in the home by making the payments more affordable. Finally, the Agencies are concerned that a \u201cbenefits\u201d test could add complexity and burden to the exemption that might undermine its intended benefits.", 
                        "The Agencies are also not adopting borrower eligibility requirements, such as that the borrower must have been on-time with payments on the existing mortgage for a certain period of time, as at least one commenter suggested. As discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, GSE and Federal government agency streamlined refinance programs require that borrower eligibility criteria be met, such as that the consumer have been current on the existing obligation for a certain period of time.\n            Commenters did not, however, explain how borrower eligibility requirements relate to whether an appraisal should be required. Again, the Agencies believe that the criteria for the refinance exemption in the final rule comprise those that relate to whether a more or less rigorous valuation requirement should apply; the Agencies believe that the main consideration is whether new credit risk will be taken on by the consumer, creditor, and investor. The criteria adopted in the final rule are designed to minimize additional risk on the refinance by curbing material increases in principal and ensuring that the ultimate credit risk holder remains the same. In addition, the Agencies believe that streamlined refinance programs can provide maximum benefit to consumers, creditors, and investors when creditors and investors retain some flexibility to adapt borrower eligibility and other requirements to address changing market environments and factors that may be unique to their programs.", 
                        "Finally, one commenter also urged the Agencies not to apply the exemption to loans that had already been refinanced, to avoid the consumer accruing excessive origination costs with successive refinances. The Agencies share concerns about harm to consumers through serial refinancings. On balance, however, the Agencies believe that consumers who have already refinanced their loans should have the same opportunities to take advantage of lower rates as other consumers. The Agencies believe that the limit on cash out helps mitigate abuses with serial refinancings by ensuring that consumers cannot continually refinance to pay off other debts without a full assessment of the collateral value.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Conditional exemption.</em> In the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies sought comment on whether the exemption for refinance loans should be conditioned on the creditor obtaining an alternative valuation (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> a valuation other than a real property appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA that includes an interior inspection) and providing a copy to the consumer three days before consummation. In requesting comment on this issue, the Agencies noted that a refinanced mortgage loan is a significant financial commitment that involves material transaction costs.", 
                        "Because refinances do involve potential risks and costs, the Agencies requested commenters' views on whether the consumer would better positioned to consider alternatives to refinancing if they were given an alternative valuation. The Agencies also sought data that might be relevant to whether this additional condition would be necessary.", 
                        "For reasons discussed below, the Agencies are not adopting a condition on the refinance exemption that the creditor obtain and give the consumer an alternative valuation. As noted, several commenters affirmatively opposed requiring creditors to obtain an alternative valuation. Commenters stated that doing so would hinder the process and increase the time and expense of these transactions unnecessarily. These commenters did not believe that a significant benefit exists in giving an alternative valuation when consumers are not increasing the amount of their debt or substituting the collateral.", 
                        "Other commenters, while not affirmatively supporting or opposing an alternative valuation condition, suggested that if an alternative valuation is required, creditors should be able to rely on an existing appraisal to the extent permitted by existing Federal appraisal regulations and the interagency appraisal guidelines,\n            which allow for using an existing appraisal. Two commenters asked whether a creditor that is considering an extension of credit secured by a junior mortgage could use the appraisal obtained by the creditor who extended credit to the same borrower secured by a first mortgage. FIRREA real estate appraisal regulations required to be issued by the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies\n            allow a regulated institution\n            to accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services institution,\n            if certain conditions are met. These include that a regulated institution may accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services institution, if: (1) The appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction; and (2) the regulated institution determines that the appraisal conforms to the requirements of this subpart and is otherwise acceptable.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Still others suggested that, if an alternative is required, a \u201cdrive-by\u201d appraisal or comparable market analysis to ensure that the home still stands and is in reasonable condition would be advisable. The Agencies believe that conditioning the exemption is not warranted, so they are not adopting this suggestion.", 
                        "Several commenters supported conditioning the exemption and recommended that an alternative valuation to an appraisal with an interior inspection should be required so that consumers are better informed about their home value.", 
                        "The Agencies believe that the condition discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule would not provide sufficient benefit to warrant the burden or cost it would introduce into the exemption. The vast majority of refinance transactions involve some type of valuation that, as of January 2014, creditors will have to provide to consumers. For example, for any refinance eligible for a Federal government program or to be sold to a GSE, the creditor would have to comply with any valuation requirements imposed under those programs. For loans not made under those programs but purchased or made by a Federally regulated financial institution, either an \u201cevaluation\u201d or an appraisal generally would be required.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau's rules in Regulation B implementing Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\n            (ECOA) require all creditors to provide to credit applicants free copies of appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.\n\n            The copies must be provided to the applicant promptly upon completion or three business days before consummation. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See id.</em> Regulation B defines &#8220;valuation&#8221; broadly to mean &#8220;any estimate of the value of a dwelling developed in connection with an application for credit.&#8221;\n            &#167; 1002.14(b)(3).", 
                        "As stated in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies recognize that obtaining estimates of value and providing copies of written valuations to consumers might not always be required by Federal law or investors. For example, certain non-depositories and depositories are not subject to the appraisal and evaluation requirements that apply to Federally regulated financial institutions under FIRREA title XI. However, the Agencies did not receive data or information suggesting that a significant number of refinances would be subject to no valuation requirements. The Agencies believe that the volume of refinances that might be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules and subject to no other valuation requirements of either the government or investors will be very small and that the benefits of conditioning the exemption for these refinances will not outweigh complexity and burden to affected creditors and their consumers seeking streamlined refinances.", 
                        "Again, the criteria for an exempt refinance adopted in the final rule are designed to limit the new risk that would result in a refinance, including risk resulting from significant additional equity being taken out of the home. Where no material credit risk is taken on in a refinance transactions, including risk resulting from a material reduction in home equity, the Agencies believe that valuation requirements are appropriately left to be determined by the parties involved in the transaction and any other applicable laws and regulations.", 
                        "In sum, the Agencies believe that the exemption is appropriately narrow in scope to capture the types of refinancings that Congress has generally expressed an intent to facilitate. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> TILA sections 129C(a)(5) and (6), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(5) and (6).\n            The Agencies believe that this exemption promotes the safety and soundness of creditors and is in the public interest."

This temporary exemption of 18 months is intended to give creditors sufficient time to make any changes needed to comply with the HPML rules that will apply to manufactured home loans as a result of the final rules that will apply to applications received on or after July 18, 2015. The Agencies understand that creditors may need to make adjustments to their compliance systems for some of the new rules.

                                "As noted, in the January 2013 Final Rule, the Agencies adopted an exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements for loans secured by a \u201cnew manufactured home.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 78 FR 10368, 10379-10380, 10433, 10438, 10444 (Feb. 13, 2013). The January 2013 Final Rule did not address loans secured by &#8220;existing&#8221; (used) manufactured homes, which therefore would be subject to the appraisal requirements unless the Agencies adopted an exemption.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, additional research and outreach on valuation practices for loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land indicated that current valuation practices for these transactions generally do not involve using a state-certified or -licensed appraiser to perform a real property appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA with an interior property inspection, as required under TILA section 129H and the January 2013 Final Rule. In addition, lender commenters on the 2012 Proposed Rule had raised concerns about the availability of data on comparable sales that may be used by appraisers for loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. They indicated that data from used manufactured home sales not involving land (usually titled as personal property) are not currently recorded in MLS of most states, so an appraiser's ability to obtain information on comparable manufactured homes without land is more limited than in real estate transactions. A provider of manufactured home valuation services confirmed in outreach with the Agencies in 2013 that manufactured home sales information is generally not available through standard real estate data sources.\n            The Agencies also understood that, in many states, appraisers are not currently required to be licensed or certified in order to perform personal property appraisals.", 
                                "Accordingly, the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule would have exempted transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land in proposed \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)(B).\n            The Agencies noted that an exemption would promote the public interest in affordable housing by ensuring transactions were not subject to a requirement not suited to this particular collateral type at this time, and would promote safety and soundness by allowing creditors to rely on currently prevalent valuation methods to ensure profitability and diversity to mitigate risk. The Agencies requested comment on this proposed exemption.", 
                                "In addition, however, the Agencies' 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule sought comment on any risks that could be created by an unconditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home, whether new <em data-original=\"E-03\">or</em> existing, and not land. After the January 2013 Final Rule was issued, consumer advocates and other stakeholders expressed concerns that some transactions in the lending channel for manufactured home-only (chattel) transactions (both of new and existing manufactured homes) can result in consumers owing more than the manufactured home is worth. For this type of loan, stakeholders such as consumer and affordable housing advocates asserted that networks of manufacturers, broker/dealers, and lenders are common, and that these parties can coordinate sales prices and loan terms to increase manufacturer, dealer, and lender profits, even where this leads to loan amounts that exceed the collateral value.", 
                                "Consumer advocates and others raised concerns that, where the original loan amount exceeds the collateral value and the consumer is unaware of this fact, the consumer is often unprepared for difficulties that can arise when seeking to refinance or sell the home at a later date. They also noted that chattel manufactured home loan transactions tend to have much higher rates than conventional mortgage loans. Some stakeholders suggested that giving the consumer third-party information about the unit value could be helpful in educating the consumer, particularly as to the risk that the loan amount might exceed the collateral value, and might prompt the consumer to ask important questions about the transaction.", 
                                "Accordingly, the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule posed a number of questions seeking comment on conditioning the exemptions for manufactured home-only transactions on providing the consumer with an estimate of the value of the manufactured home no later than three business days before consummation. The 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule discussed several types of estimates.", 
                                "First, based on input from lenders and manufactured home valuation providers, the Agencies understood that in new home-only transactions, many creditors determine the maximum amount that they will lend by using the manufacturer's invoice, or wholesale unit price, marked up by a certain percentage to reflect, for example, dealer profit and siting costs. As discussed in the 2012 Proposed Rule, informal outreach participants indicated that this practice\u2014similar to that sometimes used for automobiles\u2014is longstanding in new manufactured home transactions.\n            Lenders asserted that these methods save costs for consumers and creditors and has been found to be reasonably effective and accurate for purposes of ensuring a safe and sound loan.", 
                                "Second, outreach to manufactured home lenders indicated that in transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and not land, lenders typically obtain replacement cost estimates derived from nationally published cost services, taking into account factors such as the age of the unit (to derive depreciated values) and regional location of the home.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Third, the Agencies understood that additional methods exist for conducting personal property appraisals of manufactured homes. For example, HUD has adopted property valuation standards for HUD-insured loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. These standards call for use of a certified independent fee appraiser to conduct a valuation of the home using data on comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area.\n            \n          "

                                "Providers of valuations and their trade associations also generally supported providing copies of valuation information to consumers in these transactions. Two appraiser trade associations stated that consumers have a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to understand the market value of the property collateralizing covered loans. A provider of a manufactured home cost guide stated that consumers unequivocally would benefit from knowing the cost estimate value of their home.", 
                                "Industry support for providing this information to consumers was more limited. A State credit union association stated that in an HPML secured by an existing manufactured home and not land, the consumer should receive a copy of a valuation, which this commenter believed would be a valuable tool for the consumer. A State manufactured housing trade association stated that, if a reliable repository of data on comparable sales were developed, it would support providing the consumer a copy of a valuation based upon such data.", 
                                "More broadly, manufactured home lending industry commenters questioned the need for valuation regulations on new manufactured home transactions on several grounds. A State manufactured housing trade association noted that most manufactured housing lenders are portfolio lenders who have incentives to adopt appropriate underwriting standards and not to over-finance the loan. This commenter asserted that the widespread practice of using actual cost information from the manufacturer's invoice to determine maximum loan amount prevents over-financing. Finally, the commenter stated that over-financing has not been substantiated as a problem in manufactured home lending. Thus, the commenter suggested that the Agencies take more time to study the issue of manufactured home valuations before proposing a final rule in this area.", 
                                "Similarly, a national community banking trade association stated that a portfolio lender's assumption of credit risk is an incentive to choose appropriate valuation methods. Further, two State credit union associations stated that existing valuation methods suffice for ensuring reasonably safe and sound loans. Another State credit union association noted that creditors have alternatives to the USPAP interior-inspection appraisal, such as an exterior inspection or drive-by, or an analysis of sales of comparable homes.", 
                                "One manufactured home lender suggested that consumers purchasing manufactured homes do not need appraisals because manufactured homes are sold like automobiles, in that they are sold from a retailer's display center. Therefore, the commenter suggests that instead of providing consumers with appraisals, consumers should be encouraged to engage independently in comparative shopping when selecting a home as well as when shopping for a loan. Another manufactured home lender stated that consumers do not need information beyond the sales contract, which breaks down certain costs. This commenter stated that information about the value of the home is not relevant to these consumers because they do not buy manufactured homes for investment. A manufactured home lender also stated that it does not offer loans based on the collateral value but instead on the consumer's ability to repay.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing trade association stated that inspections by HUD-certified inspectors conducted on all new manufactured homes provide lenders and consumers a strong guarantee of the quality of a manufactured home.\n            Moreover, this commenter asserted that the HUD inspection process, coupled with the verification that lenders receive from manufactured home retailers and builders on all new manufactured homes,\n            dispenses with the need for an appraisal and interior inspection.", 
                                "Two national appraiser associations generally asserted that the importance of valuation information to the consumer and lenders far outweighs the costs and burdens of providing this information. However, one manufactured home lender suggested that the cost of performing third-party appraisals would be unnecessary for the consumer, especially given this commenter's concerns about their reliability in home-only transactions. In addition, the commenter suggested that these costs would be a particular hardship on consumers who purchase manufactured home because they tend to have lower incomes and lower credit scores than consumers of site-built homes; thus, they are purchasing a manufactured home because it is the most affordable and viable option available to them to own their own home. Finally, the commenter suggested the burden on manufactured home creditors of valuation requirements is likely to result in a reduction in lending. Similarly, a national manufactured housing trade association commenter suggested that existing valuation methods are adequate and cost consumers substantially less than traditional property appraisals.", 
                                "A manufactured home lender expressed concerns in particular about requiring creditors to provide a third-party cost service unit value to the consumer for either new or existing manufactured homes. According to this commenter, the technology and personnel required to program and develop a system to compare the home's year, manufacturer, and model name with the appropriate year, manufacturer, and model name from a specific price guide would be considerable. Further, this commenter asserted, this type of requirement would add to all lenders' overhead costs, which would increase the cost of credit (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> be passed on to the consumer). This lender predicted that such a task would deter other established creditors, including banks and credit unions, from offering financing secured by a manufactured home.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Location.</em> A question with equal applicability to transactions secured by either a new or existing manufactured home was a request for comment on the impact the location of a new manufactured home can have on its value and whether cost services are available that account adequately for differences in location. Commenters who responded generally agreed that the location of a manufactured home can have a significant impact on its value. Two national appraiser association commenters suggested that the location of a manufactured home can have a significant influence on its value and that they know of no cost services that adequately account for price differences in locations.", 
                                "A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national manufactured homeowner association, and a policy and research organization suggested that manufactured homes are very rarely moved because moving a manufactured home is expensive and likely to damage the unit. As a result, a location-based value is more relevant to resale value. These commenters further suggested that attributes of the home's location that affect the home's value are tangible and visible, but that there are other attributes of a manufactured home's location that affect the home's value that are not typically captured in existing valuation models. Examples of such characteristics provided were lease terms or State laws that: (1) Stabilize rent; (2) ensure that the home may remain where it is sited; (3) ensure that the homeowner is able to sell the home to a new owner without having to move it; and (4) protect the lender's interest in the home if the homeowner defaults on the loan.", 
                                "One manufactured home lender suggested that similar factors, such as proximity to retail shopping, the quality of the neighborhood public and private schools, the condition and upkeep of neighboring properties, and other factors that affect the value of site-built homes will also affect the value of manufactured homes. However, the commenter suggested that due to historical biases against manufactured homes in urban areas and most neighborhoods\u2014expressed through zoning restrictions, prohibitions, and restrictive covenants\u2014most manufactured homes are located in rural communities. A manufactured home lender also indicated that, in fact, it is not uncommon for manufactured homes may be moved from a sited location back to a dealer's lot, particularly when they have been foreclosed upon and are in rural areas.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Further study.</em> Several commenters suggested that more time may be needed to develop reliable alternatives to a USPAP- and FIRREA-compliant appraisal based upon a physical inspection of the interior of the home. Two manufactured housing lenders, while generally opposed to conditioning the exemption, suggested the Agencies that postpone any decision on these issues for several months of further evaluation. A State manufactured housing trade association indicated that it would only support a condition if a mandatory repository of data on comparable sales were developed and sufficient time passed for this repository to populate.\n\n            This commenter also expressed concerns that very few, if any, loans secured by manufactured homes would be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules as qualified mortgages. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(i). This commenter suggested that the large number of loans potentially covered by conditions on any exemption for manufactured home transactions that would involve alternative valuations warranted further study of these options by the Agencies.",

These commenters observed that this approach would help to integrate the manufactured housing sector into the larger housing market. In their view, valuation rules would create demand, which would improve capacity for providing valuations and also generate more financing options for manufactured home consumers."

                                "The Agencies solicited comment on whether it would be appropriate and beneficial to consumers to condition the exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements on the creditor providing the consumer with various types of third-party information about the manufactured home's cost, which third-party estimates should be used for these estimates, and when creditors should be required to provide the information. The Agencies received several comments on these questions. Representatives of appraisal providers, a credit union, a community bank, a consumer advocacy group, three affordable housing groups, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and one policy and research organization generally suggested that consumers would benefit. On the other hand, a manufactured home lender, two manufactured housing trade associations, a State credit union association, a mortgage company, a national community bank trade association, and a national mortgage banking trade association generally suggested that consumers would not benefit and a condition should not be adopted.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Manufacturer's invoice.</em> Regarding the utility of providing the consumer with a copy of the manufacturer's invoice, a consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing groups, a national manufactured homeowner association, and a policy and research organization stated that in the near term consumers would benefit from receiving the manufacturer's invoice because this is what manufactured home lenders rely on in transactions involving new manufactured homes. They asserted that a consumer who is given the invoice is better able to evaluate the accuracy of the description of the home's features. Given concerns about truth and accuracy in invoices in capturing all dealer payments, though, these commenters suggested that these transactions ultimately should be subject to the HPML appraisal rules on the same basis as site-built homes. In their view, higher valuation standards would improve appraiser capacity and, they argued, decrease incentives to steer consumers to loans with weaker standards.", 
                                "Regarding the credibility of manufacturer's invoices, the Agencies received conflicting information. One affordable housing organization differentiated between a dealer's invoice and a manufacturer's invoice, indicating that incentives and rebates might be omitted from the dealer's invoice but not from the manufacturer's invoice so the manufacturer's invoice would be more reliable for the consumer. A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization, however, commented that the manufacturer's invoice may not have accurate information about the actual cost paid by the dealer because it might not reflect incentives, rebates, and in-kind services agreed upon by the dealer and manufacturer. However, as noted, they believed that the representation of home features on the invoice would be useful to consumers.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing trade association stated that the manufacturer certifies to the retailer the authenticity and accuracy of the wholesale cost of the manufactured home at the point of manufacture. A manufactured housing lender further suggested that the manufacturer's invoice is the only realistic option upon which to base a home's value because it takes into account the upgrades and other features pertinent to the home. This commenter suggested that the invoice amount also offers a \u201cconservative\u201d figure in terms of valuation and loan-to-value considerations. However, the commenter noted that a consumer's total sales price will include certain other third-party charges related to the move and set-up of the manufactured home, dealer mark-ups and occasionally local government fees required to be paid by the dealer.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Third-party cost service estimates.</em> Regarding the utility of providing a third-party unit estimate from an independent cost service, a credit union commenter stated that a third-party unit estimate would give consumers a valuable guideline to prevent predatory practices. Similarly, a community bank commenter stated that this information could help alleviate the potential for dealer price markups over manufacturer's suggested retail price. A national provider of a manufactured home cost service stated in its comment letter that its cost guide information could &#8220;absolutely&#8221; be useful to consumers, but cautioned that providing consumers with multiple different indications of value could make the process more confusing to consumers. The provider further stated that its cost guide can be used to provide a &#8220;guideline&#8221; that is a &#8220;reasonable approximation&#8221; for a new manufactured home value using the &#8220;new or like new&#8221; condition for the current-year model. The cost guide provider indicated that its value estimates consider the home's manufacturer, model, size, year, and region. In its cost guide, adjustments are also possible for State location, the general condition of the home, as well as for value added by additional features.", 
                                "An affordable housing organization stated that creditors should be required to obtain cost estimates from an independent appraiser based upon nationally-published cost information. This commenter stated that consumers will be better informed with more information.", 
                                "On the other hand, several industry and industry trade association commenters suggested that providing copies of third-party estimates would be of no benefit to consumers or would cause consumer confusion. One manufactured home lender asserted that cost guides consider pieces of property in the abstract and fail to account for the cost of permits, site preparation, and delivering the home to the purchaser's site. Moreover, this commenter suggested cost guides are typically used by lenders only to determine a value for pre-owned manufactured homes. A State manufactured housing association also noted that the third-party cost guides are not used in practice for new manufactured home transactions, a view confirmed by a manufactured home lender during informal outreach.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Independent valuations.</em> Regarding third-party valuations for new home-only transactions generally, a number of industry, consumer group, and other commenters stated that in their view there does not exist today a reliable national third party database for comparable sales for new manufactured homes. However, two national appraiser association commenters stated that they strongly support requiring an independent third-party valuation by a credentialed third party appraiser with education, training, and experience, or a valuation through the National Appraisal System (NAS), which would be consistent with the requirements of government programs.\n            \n          ", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Information for the consumer.</em> The Agencies also solicited comment on whether the consumer in an HPML transaction to be secured by a new manufactured home and not land typically receives unit cost information, and what cost information from a reliable independent third-party source might be reasonably available to creditors and useful to a consumer. Several commenters responded to this and a related question; all generally suggested that, other than the retail purchase and sale agreement between the manufactured home purchaser and the retailer, no third-party information is currently provided to consumers about the value of their new manufactured home. One manufactured home lender noted that the retail purchase agreement will list the retail price of the manufactured home and itemize and include in the total cost all other costs and charges associated with the transactions and installation of the home and extras. Another manufactured home lender added that it is not the industry custom to disclose the wholesale amount to a consumer. Rather, the commenter suggested, the Agencies should not require disclosures of cost information for consumers and deviate from widely accepted practice in other areas of retail sales, including automobiles or site-built homes.", 
                                "Most of the commenters who responded on the information availability issue suggested that there was currently no readily-accessible, publicly-available information that consumers could use to determine whether their loan amount exceeds the collateral value in a new manufactured home chattel transaction. Two national appraiser associations asserted that, under the statute, consumers have a fundamental right to know the value of the home that collateralizes debt they incur. However, a provider of a manufactured home cost guide suggested that consumers could access manufactured home value information on its Web site representing the depreciated replacement cost of a home.", 
                                "Regarding the best timing for a creditor to provide a unit value estimate to a consumer, two national appraiser associations suggested that the information should be delivered to the prospective borrower as early in the loan underwriting process as possible. A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization suggested that a copy of the manufacturer's invoice should be provided to consumers after the execution of the buyer's order but prior to the consummation of the transaction. Finally, one community bank suggested that third-party cost guide information should be provided to the consumer at least three days prior to consummation because the data is readily available through the database."

However, a number of commenters favored conditioning the exemption on the creditor obtaining and providing valuation information to the consumer.

This commenter also believed valuation professionals lacked sufficient experience with USPAP personal property appraisal standards to comply with them in existing manufactured home-only transactions.

A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization stated, however, that any appraiser capacity issues are driven by a lack of valuation standards for the manufactured housing segment. As a result, allowing the rule to take effect after a temporary period would lead to demand for appraisers, creating an incentive for appraisers to obtain the requisite skills.", 
                                "A number of commenters expressed concern that the limited availability of data on comparable sales for transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and not land posed a significant barrier to obtaining reliable third-party appraisals for these transactions. A manufactured home lender stated that sales of existing manufactured homes on leased land are not reported to MLS and that data on comparable sales outside of California is generally lacking. The commenter noted, though, that one private company does aggregate comparable sales data from different sources around the country, which is usually used for transactions in land-lease communities. The national manufactured housing trade association added that state-certified or -licensed appraisers do not capture data on sales of existing manufactured homes, whether from retail dealers or communities. In addition, this commenter suggested that data may be distorted by foreclosures in rural areas leading to relocation of homes to dealer inventory. The State manufactured housing trade association commenter stated that the lack of a reliable nationwide database of comparable sales should be remedied and indicated that the one statewide database (in California) only receives data on a voluntary basis.\n            \n          ",

A national community bank trade association and a State credit union association generally believed that that a USPAP-complaint appraisal with an interior inspection would be costly for low-income borrowers purchasing existing manufactured homes. Another State credit union association and a national credit union association supported the exemption because manufactured home values are generally lower than the values of other types of home.

One manufactured home lender stated that it uses the guide to calculate a &#8220;theoretical&#8221; value, which is imperfect given the lack of reliable information about the condition of the home. Another nonbank lender stated that while it uses this guide to determine approximate wholesale value on trade-ins and as a general guide to the potential sale price for repossessions, it does not use the guide in transactions to finance the purchase or refinance of an existing manufactured home and not land.\n            A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization further confirmed the widespread use of third-party cost service depreciation schedules in this segment of the market.", 
                                "Regarding the accuracy of third-party cost service estimates for existing manufactured homes, a national provider of a manufactured home cost guide stated that its values are derived by applying depreciation factors to the cost estimate of the home, and are designed to represent \u201cretail worth\u201d assuming average condition and certain components. Adjustments can be made for actual condition, inventoried components, and local site value (for homes located in land-lease communities).\n\n            The commenter stated that the local site value adjustment is representative of a national average of the contributing value for land-lease communities with certain attributes. After accounting for this adjustment, the value can be up to 33 percent higher or 11 percent lower than the value of the structure only (on average, the location adjustment adds 13 percent). While acknowledging that only appraisers are qualified to analyze a property's sited location, this commenter claimed that its location adjustment was more cost effective than an appraisal based upon a physical inspection, without sacrificing accuracy. When it compared its location-adjusted values with estimates from a sample of over 1,000 personal property appraisals of manufactured homes over a wide range of ages, it found that the median difference between its estimates and the appraised value was less than five percent.", 
                                "Views of other commenters on the accuracy of third-party cost guide estimate were more mixed. A manufactured home lender stated that cost guides are used as a guideline by lenders rather than as an estimate of resale value. Another manufactured home lender stated that the cost guide does not include transaction costs, including setup fees, which can lead to unreliable estimates for consumers.", 
                                "A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization believed that estimates based upon these cost guides fail to value correctly important factors related to the location of the home, such as the security of land tenure, risk of rent increases, and community attributes, among others. These commenters also noted that the cost guide assumes the property value has depreciated and that available adjustments based upon the property condition are not required; as a result, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades could be left out of the value and the property could be under-valued. Further, these commenters expressed concern that widespread use of a depreciated value could drive rather than reflect manufactured home values. However, another affordable housing organization believed that, despite concerns expressed by some about the utility of a third-party estimate based upon a nationally-published cost service, consumers will be better informed with this information.", 
                                "A State manufactured housing trade association expressed concerns that depreciated values available through a cost service can be understated. While this commenter noted that adjustments can be made, the commenter asserted that questions remain as to who should make the adjustments and whether they will be made in a uniform, valid, and reliable manner.", 
                                "One manufactured home lender believed that the use of physical inspections to provide a basis for making adjustments to depreciated unit cost estimates was not widespread. This commenter also pointed out that some transactions are consummated before the existing manufactured home is placed on the new site making it infeasible for the lender to arrange for pre-closing inspections of the home at its new site in these situations.",

A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization stated that comparable sales typically are selected based upon characteristics such as type of sale, size, style, and location of the home.", 
                                "A State manufactured housing trade association noted that a private company can provide comparable sales reports for some transactions. A manufactured home lender indicated that this service also included a physical inspection, and is used for transactions secured by homes in land-lease communities in particular when a cost guide estimate does not match the sales price.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing trade association stated that, for FHA Title I program loans, a physical inspection is conducted to adjust for site additions and the physical condition of the home. A State manufactured housing association asserted that the NAS is rarely used because only a small number of originations are currently done under the Title I FHA program for which NAS appraisals are specifically approved.\n            This commenter and a manufactured home lender stated suggested that the small number of FHA Title I program loans is due in part to eligibility requirements, including appraisal requirements.", 
                                "The consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research group stated that the FHA Title I appraisal system is overly focused on one characteristic of the home (that it is a manufactured home) and excludes use of other types of comparables that may be more suitable. A manufactured home lender noted that HUD-approved valuation methods based upon comparable sales tend to yield values below the sales price, which this commenter attributed to an over-emphasis on use of manufactured homes as comparables.\n            Another manufactured home lender claimed that this occurrence in HUD-approved appraisals is evidence that they undervalue manufactured homes. A manufactured home lender expressed concerns about the cost of NAS appraisals under the FHA Title I program. This lender stated that, if a condition is imposed, lenders should have more than one option for the type of valuation that would satisfy the condition.", 
                                "A national association for community banking also referred to all of the above types of valuations as options for valuating these transactions, in addition to an evaluation by a bank employee. This commenter stated that some bank employees conduct interior or exterior inspections.", 
                                "An affordable housing organization believed that creditors should be required to obtain a replacement cost estimate from a trained, independent appraiser using a nationally-published cost service. Two national appraiser trade associations stated that, in light of the importance of the location to the value of the home, the Agencies should require an independent third-party valuation by a credentialed appraiser with education, training, and experience,\n\n            or a valuation that complies with the appraisal system specified under the FHA Title I program for insuring loans secured by existing manufactured homes and not land. A community bank stated that interior and exterior inspections should be conducted, due to higher depreciation of manufactured homes compared to site-built homes."

The Agencies believe that exempting transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors, provided that such exemption is conditioned on the consumer receiving certain information as provided in detail below. The Agencies also are adopting a condition on the exemption for transactions secured by new manufactured homes and not land adopted in the January 2013 Final Rule. Under the condition, for applications received by the creditor on or after July 18, 2015, an HPML that is not a qualified mortgage and is secured by either a new or existing manufactured home without land will be exempt from the general HPML appraisal rules in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3) through (c)(6) if the creditor provides the consumer with a copy of any one of three specified types of information no later than three days prior to consummation of the transaction. The three types of information that can satisfy the condition are: (1) The manufacturer's invoice for the manufactured home, where the date of manufacture is within 18 months of the creditor's receipt of the consumer's application; (2) a cost estimate of the value of the manufactured home from an independent cost service; or (3) a valuation, as defined in \u00a7 1026.42(b)(3), of the manufactured home by a person who has no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction for which the valuation is performed and has training in valuing manufactured homes.",

The heading for the comment is revised to remove the word \u201csolely,\u201d to reflect that this provision applies to transactions that are secured by a manufactured home and other collateral that is not land, such as a leasehold interest.

The unconditional exemption for transactions secured by a new manufactured home, with or without land, will go into effect on January 18, 2014, but will end starting with applications received by the creditor on or after July 18, 2015. At that time, the exempt status of transactions secured by new manufactured homes will depend on whether the transaction also is secured by land.

                                "The Agencies believe that the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B) for loans secured by manufactured homes and not land promotes the safety and soundness of creditors in part because the exemption makes it possible for creditors to continue making these loans, which may be an important part of a given creditor's operations; the Agencies understand that for chattel transactions, compliance with all of the general HPML appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3) through (6) may be infeasible. The condition on the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B) is necessary to ensure that the exemption is also in the public interest, because the condition will ensure that consumers receive information pertaining to the value of their manufactured home. The Agencies further believe that by allowing creditors a menu of options for compliance, the condition will provide appropriate flexibility to the creditor to select which materials it deems most cost-effective. The Agencies also believe that having this information before consummation of the loan can be useful to the consumer, and is consistent with the timing of the general HPML appraisal requirement that the creditor must give the consumer a copy of the appraisal three days before consummation.\n            \n            <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(6)(ii).", 
                                "TILA Section 129H ensures that, before consummation of a \u201chigher-risk mortgage,\u201d creditors obtain a valuation of the home and provide a copy to the consumer. 15 U.S.C. 1639h. The statute focuses on transactions with a higher risk profile (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> those with higher interest rates and which are not qualified mortgages). For these riskier transactions, the statute sets standards that are intended to reduce the risk of inflated valuations of the &#8220;dwelling,&#8221; and grants consumers a right to know the appraised value of the &#8220;dwelling&#8221; before entering into these transactions.\n            A manufactured home is a &#8220;dwelling&#8221; under regulations implementing TILA.\n            Indeed, transactions secured by manufactured homes and not land comprise a substantial proportion of the overall annual housing transactions that are HPMLs and not qualified mortgages.\n            The Agencies therefore believe that Congress intended for TILA Section 129H to provide protection against inflated valuations and transparency to borrowers in this housing segment.", 
                                "Nonetheless, based upon outreach and comments on the 2012 Proposed Rule and further outreach and comments on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies believe that the precise form of valuation specified in the statute\u2014an appraisal by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA, based upon a physical inspection of the interior of the home\u2014is infeasible for this housing segment at this time. A steady supply of state-certified or -licensed appraisers to service thousands of these transactions annually starting on January 18, 2014, does not yet exist.", 
                                "Even if more state-certified or -licensed appraisers were able to perform appraisals for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land in the future, the Agencies recognize that sources of data on comparable sales for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land may not be as robust as sources of data on sales of transactions secured by a home and land.\n            As a result, the Agencies believe that, absent an exemption, creditors could be unable to comply with the HPML appraisal requirements in a substantial number of transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. Thus, the Agencies have concluded that an exemption from a requirement to perform appraisals in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for these transactions would promote the safety and soundness of creditors and be in the public interest by allowing the transactions to occur without requiring use of a valuation method that is infeasible in a large number of cases.", 
                                "At the same time, the risk of inflated valuations in these transactions can contribute to increased default risk,\n            which runs counter to both the safety and soundness of creditors and the public interest. The Agencies are concerned, based on research, outreach, and comments received, that these transactions can be prone to inflated valuations and associated risks of under-collateralization, leading to loans where the consumer has little, no, or even negative equity in the home.\n            The Agencies believe that an unconditional exemption for these transactions at a minimum would not adequately account for the risks of under-collateralization.", 
                                "The effect of an inflated valuation on consumers and their risk of default can be even more pronounced in these transactions. Chattel lending generally carries higher interest rates, which could result in a significant number of HOEPA loans.\n\n            Further, several industry commenters indicated that manufactured home loans would be less likely to be qualified mortgages than other types of mortgages because their points and fees would typically exceed thresholds set by the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(3). At the same time, consumers borrowing these loans are disproportionately in the LMI segment.\n            Higher loan amounts resulting from inflated valuations, combined with the comparatively high interest rates on these loans, can generate payments that pose significant burdens on LMI consumers and can put them at greater risk of default.", 
                                "Outreach and comments from the 2012 Proposed Rule and 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule have not shown that existing industry practices or standards necessarily would be sufficient to control the risk of inflated valuations in these transactions, or ensure that consumers are informed of the home value in these transactions. To compound the concern, most of these transactions are not subject to valuation standards imposed by Federal law or regulation or Federal agency or GSE programs. The FHA Title I Manufactured Housing Loan Insurance Program is the only program at the Federal level that covers these transactions; no other Federal agency or GSE has programs for loans secured by a manufactured home and not land. The FHA Title I program includes valuation requirements and loan amount caps to mitigate against the risk of inflated valuations, but currently most transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land are not insured by that program. Some of these transactions are originated by Federally regulated financial institutions subject to FIRREA's appraisal and evaluation requirements, but the FIRREA regulations and related Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines apply only to real estate transactions.\n            Under current State laws, the collateral in transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land is not typically classified as real property.", 
                                "In addition, all creditors are subject to Regulation Z's interim final valuation independence rule (Valuation Independence Rule) for consumer credit secured by chattel, but the valuation service providers are not, due to a limitation in the current rule.\n            The Valuation Independence Rule applies to creditors and \u201csettlement service\u201d providers of covered transactions.\n            Under the rule, \u201csettlement service\u201d is defined under RESPA and implementing regulations (Regulation X).\n            Under RESPA and Regulation X, a \u201csettlement service\u201d is limited to services for \u201cFederally related mortgage loans,\u201d which include only loans secured by real property.\n            Thus, valuation service providers for transactions secured by personal property, such as many transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land, are not covered under Regulation Z's Valuation Independence Rule.", 
                                "Further, commenters indicated that consumers in transactions secured by manufactured homes and not land do not currently receive information about the value of their homes. Participants in informal outreach and research conducted by the Agencies similarly indicated that consumers for these loans are not familiar with independent information about home values and may be subject to high-pressure sales tactics that tend to limit consumer's consideration of their choices and pursuit of independent information.", 
                                "Finally, while consumers might receive valuations in some of these transactions under the Bureau's 2013 ECOA Valuations Final Rule,\n\n            creditors might not always obtain a valuation subject to disclosure to the consumer under that rule. For example, in new manufactured home transactions without land, outreach and comments indicated that creditors often rely primarily upon the manufacturer's invoice when determining the maximum loan amount. The manufacturer's invoice is not subject to disclosure under the 2013 ECOA Valuations Final Rule.\n            In addition, the maximum loan amount is not necessarily a valuation subject to disclosure under ECOA, and could well exceed caps defined under HUD regulations that serve to prevent over-financing, under-collateralization, and underwater loans.\n            Accordingly, even if that amount were disclosed to consumers under the 2013 ECOA Valuations Rule, it would not necessarily impart meaningful, independent information to the consumer about the value of the home.", 
                                "The Agencies therefore are adopting a condition on the exemption to ensure that valuation information from an independent source is obtained and is transparent to the consumer. The condition requires the creditor to obtain and provide to the consumer, no later than three days before consummation, certain information related to the value of the manufactured home securing the covered HPML.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Agencies have identified three types of materials, any one of which can be provided, as further discussed below.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Providing a copy of a manufacturer's invoice used by a creditor for a transaction secured by a new manufactured home.</em> Under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), a creditor on a loan secured by a new manufactured home and not land may be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules if the creditor gives the consumer a copy of the manufacturer's invoice, which is defined consistent with HUD manufactured home program regulations. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(1)(iv) and accompanying section-by-section analysis.", 
                                "Outreach and comments consistently indicated that in these transactions, creditors use the invoice as the primary source for calculating a maximum loan amount. For that reason, several commenters generally supported providing a copy of the invoice to consumers as a means of informing them of pertinent valuation information. A national manufactured housing trade association also asserted that it is standard practice for manufacturers to certify the authenticity and accuracy of the wholesale cost of the home at the point of manufacture.", 
                                "The Agencies are adopting a limitation on the option to provide the manufacturer's invoice: the invoice may be provided to satisfy the condition only if the date of manufacture of the home was within 18 months of the creditor's receipt of the consumer's application for credit. This limitation is generally consistent with FHA Title I regulations, which incorporate the practice of using manufacturers' invoices as a reference point for determining safe and sound loan amounts for insuring transactions secured by new manufactured homes. Specifically, FHA Title I rules limit the use of this practice to homes manufactured within 18 months of purchase by the consumer.\n            The Agencies believe that this limitation will help prevent the use of invoices that are too dated to reflect reliably the current value of the manufactured home.", 
                                "Creditors commonly obtain and rely on the manufacturer's invoice and consumer advocates, affordable housing organizations, and others, however, have asserted that consumers should have access to information that creditors use. If creditors have the invoice, providing a consumer with a copy imposes little burden.", 
                                "The Agencies note that some commenters were concerned that the manufacturer's invoice contains sensitive wholesale pricing information and that the wholesale invoice from the manufacturer will not match the retail price paid by the consumer. The Agencies recognize that the retail price will include a markup for various costs. Commenters and industry participants in outreach indicated that in transactions secured by new manufactured homes, the maximum loan amount typically is determined by applying a percentage markup to the manufacturer's invoice. Outreach indicated that this markup can vary among creditors, in some cases significantly. The Agencies are not aware of any regulatory standards governing the extent of this markup other than limitations in the FHA Title I program, which only covers a small subset of these loans currently. The FHA Title I limitations do not permit a markup on the manufacturer's invoice of more than 130 percent when calculating the maximum insurable loan amount, and HUD has other detailed standards for determining what other charges can be factored into the maximum loan amount.\n            Most manufactured housing transactions are not subject to these restrictions, leaving the markup to be determined by the creditor's tolerance for risk, and thus subject to risk of inflated valuation.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that providing the manufacturer's invoice to consumers will give them an opportunity to have a better understanding of the factors contributing to the loan amount and its relationship to the value of the home.\n            In transactions secured by a home and land under GSE and Federal agency programs, the appraiser is required to receive a copy of this invoice and must disclose in the appraisal report how it was considered.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Under the final rule, creditors also may choose to communicate the nature or extent of this markup to consumers when providing the manufacturer's invoice. In this case, the manufacturer's invoice will provide an opportunity for questions from consumers to assess whether the markup leads the collateral to be over-valued. As noted above, HUD-certified counselors, required for HOEPA transactions and available for others, also can assist consumers in answering any questions. The Agencies have sought to accommodate remaining concerns over providing the manufacturer's invoice by providing other compliance options that could be used in new manufactured home transactions (including that the loan might qualify for another exemption under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)).\n            \n          ",

Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>)-1 clarifies that a cost service provider from which the creditor obtains a manufactured home unit cost estimate under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) is independent if that party is not affiliated with the creditor in the transaction, such as by common corporate ownership, and receives no direct or indirect financial benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.", 
                                "As noted above, the Agencies recognize that creditors may choose not to provide a copy of the manufacturer's invoice for new manufactured home transactions. In addition, appraisers or valuation providers may be unavailable for some transactions. Thus, including this additional option is important to ensure that the consumer can receive a unit cost estimate of the value of the home from an independent source. Commenters and outreach indicated that this type of estimate is the predominant method used for transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. Based upon comments from a national cost service provider confirming that its cost guide reports values for the current model year, the Agencies also believe this type of cost service also could be used for many new manufactured home transactions. The Agencies learned from one cost service that an adjustment for \u201cnew or like new\u201d is available through its cost guide, and that this guide is updated multiple times per year.", 
                                "The information provided by an independent cost service provider can provide a useful outside check against inflated valuations. At the same time, the check will not prohibit transactions above the value reflected in the cost service. Rather, the check will make sure that if transactions occur above those values, creditors and consumers have the opportunity to know that fact and evaluate the transaction accordingly.", 
                                "Interior inspections and adjustments. The Agencies are not requiring physical inspections of the interior or condition or location adjustments to the cost service values. In this way, the condition ensures that the creditor can readily identify the information to be provided to the consumer (based upon the make and model and year of the manufactured home unit) from an independent source, without being asked to interject subjective or discretionary considerations.", 
                                "Interior inspections by an appraiser for new manufactured homes may often be of limited value, given the associated expense. For transactions secured by new manufactured homes, as indicated by industry commenters, HUD and State inspectors conduct inspections to ensure the proper construction and installation of the home.\n            Some commenters asserted that an interior inspection could confirm the existence of extras or options that were promised. The Agencies believe, however, that consumers themselves can confirm that they received extras or options ordered. Regarding adjustments, the Agencies understand that cost services may offer adjustments of standard estimates to reflect that the unit is in \u201cnew or like new\u201d condition.", 
                                "For existing manufactured homes, information about the condition of the interior can be an important factor affecting the valuation. Due to concerns with burden, complexity, and reliability of such adjustments, though, the Agencies are not mandating that adjustments be made. At the same time, the rule does not prohibit creditors from making this adjustment to the unit-cost estimate of an existing manufactured home.", 
                                "Accordingly, comment 35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>)-2 clarifies that the requirement that the cost estimate be from an independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to factors such as special features, condition or location. The comment explains, however, that the requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost service used, with associated values that are determined by the independent cost service.", 
                                "For both new and existing manufactured homes, the location can enhance or, in some cases, reduce the value of the home. A consumer advocate group, affordable housing organizations, and others emphasized that cost service data does not adequately account for the contribution of location to the value of the home. The manufactured home can be resold as a trade-in or repossessed, however, in which case its value-in-place is not what is relevant to the consumer. Further, as noted above, location adjustments can introduce greater subjectivity into the information provided. Therefore, the rule does not mandate that a location adjustment be made. Providing the unit value will enable consumers to compare the cost estimate from the published cost service to the line item charge in the sales contract for the base unit.", 
                                "Finally, some commenters expressed concerns over accuracy or undervaluation in the unit cost estimates published by third-party cost services. These commenters did not provide data to support their views, however. In addition, while some comments noted that the unit cost estimate is not the same as an estimate of the retail market value, the Agencies recognize that this type of estimate nonetheless is widely used by creditors currently as a guideline for the value of an existing manufactured home. In some cases, it therefore may represent the best available, most cost-effective estimate of the value of the home. Further, the Agencies are structuring the exemption condition so that the creditor has the discretion to choose which of the specified types of valuation materials it finds most suitable for informing the consumer of the estimated value of the home. Thus, if a creditor believes an independent cost service generally undervalues manufactured homes, the creditor can provide other forms of valuation information as described below, as well as its own accompanying explanatory information.",

                                "The Agencies included this comment in recognition that one of the more well-developed standards for the valuation of manufactured homes and not land is found in the FHA Title I program.\n            When an existing manufactured home is classified as personal property, FHA Title I requires creditors to, among other things: (1) Use an appraiser certified to use the NAS or, if the lender is unable to locate an NAS-certified appraiser, an appraiser from the FHA Title II mortgage program who certifies having experience appraising manufactured homes;\n            (2) obtain an appraisal performed on the home site where possible and that reflects the retail value of comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area; and (3) review the appraisal to verify, among other things, that the correct cost service unit value was used and proper condition adjustment was made.\n            \n          ", 
                                "As noted in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies are aware that fewer than 100 individuals are currently certified to use this system, although many more have been certified in the past and may have incentives to obtain the certification in the future. This factor provides further support for the Agencies' decision to allow creditors multiple options to comply with the condition.", 
                                "Consumer and affordable housing advocate commenters supported the long-term goal of applying an appraisal standard to transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. At the same time, manufacturer housing industry commenters generally supported a long-term effort to further refine and develop valuation methods for manufactured homes. The Agencies believe that adopting a condition that furthers these goals is in the public interest. To allow flexibility for these and other valuation methods to evolve, the Agencies seek to avoid prescriptive, detailed requirements on the valuation method. Rather, the Agencies seek generally to define who is eligible to perform the valuation, and leave the method to that person's judgment and expertise as appropriate for the scope of work required. As noted above, two national appraisal trade associations noted that state-certified or -licensed appraisers are not the only persons who could value manufactured homes. For example, some commenters identified an existing product prepared by a company who hires individuals trained in the valuation of manufactured homes. The company generates a report that estimates the value of a given manufactured home using local data on comparable sales.", 
                                "Accordingly, under this alternative, the creditor must provide the consumer with a valuation prepared by one or more individuals who do not have a direct or indirect financial interest in the property or the transaction, and who have training in the valuation of manufactured homes. The Agencies are adopting comments to provide further guidance on how creditors can satisfy these criteria. Finally, it may follow from the exercise of independent judgment and application of this training that the individual will conduct a physical inspection of the interior, or assess the condition or value of the location of the home. But as noted, at this time, the Agencies are not specifying these steps as necessary elements of a valuation that satisfies the condition.", 
                                "Several industry commenters indicated that HUD appraisal requirements in transactions secured by manufactured homes have led to higher frequency of appraisals where the value of the home is below the purchase price. At least one commenter indicated this occurred in Title I transactions secured by existing manufactured homes. Some commenters and outreach participants attributed high numbers of appraised values that are lower than the purchase price to an over-emphasis on the use of manufactured homes as comparables in FHA and other manufactured home credit programs. They suggested, for example, that manufactured homes comparables in the geographic area might be much older than the home being appraised. The Agencies are concerned, however, that other factors can contribute to higher rates of appraised values lower than the purchase price, such as inflated purchase prices and corresponding loan amounts.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that, on balance, appraising manufactured homes in transactions that are not also secured by land can be an effective way to account for the many factors that contribute to the value of the home, including home condition, location, re-sale conditions, and lease terms, among others.\n          "

                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Delay in issuing rules on manufactured home loans.</em> As discussed under &#8220;Public Comments,&#8221; commenters on behalf of consumers and industry generally expressed support in principle for ensuring that consumers receive valuation information in exempt transactions. Industry commenters raised a number of concerns over the utility to consumers of information generated through current valuation practices, however. Several consumer and affordable housing groups expressed a similar concern over the quality of current valuation methods (citing, for example, concerns over the reliability of a cost estimate of the unit from a third-party source). They nonetheless stated that creditors should still be required to provide a copy of the collateral valuation information that is used by the creditor (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> manufacturer's invoice in new manufactured home transactions). These commenters also suggested that the Agencies engage in further study of manufactured housing valuation issues before adopting further conditions.", 
                                "The Agencies note, however, that manufactured housing valuation practices and issues have been the subject of significant requests for comment and outreach in two separate proposals, and have generated detailed comment from representatives of industry, consumer advocates, and appraisers alike. The Agencies believe that the current public record sufficiently supports adopting conditions in this final rule. While the Agencies are allowing additional 18 months for conditions to be implemented, deferring their adoption pending further study would not promote safety and soundness and be in the public interest. Thousands of consumers would be without the protections during any further study. It also is unclear that further study, beyond the two years of study already undertaken, would generate material improvements to the approach taken here.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Steering.</em> Some consumer group and affordable housing commenters also expressed concern that consumers might be steered into higher-rate chattel transactions with fewer consumer protections if the final rule provided an unconditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. For example, consumers could be steered away from an HPML transaction secured by both the home and land to avoid the HPML appraisal requirements (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(viii), effective July 18, 2015). Creditors might also structure what otherwise would be a packaged land/home transactions into two transactions&#8212;one secured solely by the home and one by land. The Agencies believe that some of these concerns are mitigated by other laws and regulations. Such practices might be subject to scrutiny under consumer protection laws at the State and Federal level. For example, regulations may apply that generally prohibit a loan originator from steering a consumer to a transaction based on the fact that the originator will receive greater compensation (which could result from an over-valuation of the home, leading to a higher loan amount).\n            The Agencies believe that some of the concerns about steering may be mitigated by conditioning the exemption for manufactured home-only transactions on the creditor having to provide alternative valuation information to the consumer.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Effective date.</em> The Agencies recognize creditors will need time to make necessary adjustments to their compliance systems to be able to comply with the condition. For example, creditors will need to adjust their systems to identify transactions that would need to rely on the exemption (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> HPMLs that are not eligible for exemptions for loans that satisfy the criteria of a qualified mortgage, transactions in an amount of $25,000 or less, or other exemption types (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)),\n            to determine which types of valuation materials to obtain for these transactions, and to develop a mechanism for providing these to the consumer no later than three days prior to consummation. Creditors also will need to ensure that they have access to the valuation materials they choose to use. To ensure adequate time to implement these and any other necessary steps, and that these transactions remain available to consumers in the interim period, the Agencies are delaying implementation of the condition for 18 months after the effective date of the HPML Appraisals Rules, until July 18, 2015.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Sunset.</em> Finally, the Agencies are not adopting an expiration date for the conditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. Some commenters suggested that a &#8220;sunset&#8221; date would provide an incentive for the appraiser and manufactured home lending industries to improve capacity and methods for conducting appraisals that would comply with USPAP and FIRREA. However, it is unclear that a sunset date would promote this outcome. At the same time, a sunset date would create risk for this important source of affordable housing if capacity and methods are not developed by that date. The Agencies believe that a better way to promote improved capacity and methods is to allow the condition to be satisfied through the use of existing methods. This is therefore another reason why the Agencies are allowing the third option for satisfying the condition&#8212;appraisals performed by independent and trained individuals."
