The Final Rule provides new protections, including disclosures and error resolution and cancellation rights, to consumers who send remittance transfers to other consumers or businesses in a foreign country. The Final Rule inadvertently did not reflect certain technical and conforming changes made by the interim final rule published on December 27, 2011. The Final Rule also contained a technical error in the formatting of certain model forms. This document corrects the error and the formatting of the model forms.",
