Metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). For purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)(1), \u201cadjacent\u201d has the meaning applied by the USDA-ERS in determining a county's UIC; as so applied, \u201cadjacent\u201d entails a county not only being physically contiguous with a metropolitan statistical area but also meeting certain minimum population commuting patterns. A county is a \u201crural\u201d area if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Descriptions of UICs are available on the USDA-ERS Web site at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx. A county for which there is no currently applicable UIC (because the county has been created since the USDA-ERS last categorized counties) is a rural area only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken are themselves rural under currently applicable UICs."

These designations and delineations are updated by the USDA-ERS and the U.S. Census Bureau respectively once every ten years. As an example, assume a creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in Census Block X that is located in County Y during calendar year 2017. As of January 1, 2017, the most recent UIC designations were published in the second quarter of 2013, and the most recent delineation of urban areas was announced in the Federal Register in 2012, see U.S. Census Bureau, Qualifying Urban Areas for the 2010 Census, 77 FR 18652 (Mar. 27, 2012). To determine whether County Y is rural under the Bureau's definition during calendar year 2017, the creditor can use USDA-ERS's 2013 UIC designations. If County Y is not rural, the creditor can use the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 delineation of urban areas to determine whether Census Block X is rural and is therefore a \u201crural\u201d area for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)."

For the depository institutions that did not report under HMDA, the Bureau is aware of the location of the creditors' branches. The Bureau assumed that mortgage lending is spread equally across a creditor's branches. The Bureau also assumed that if a branch is in a given county, then the same proportion of loans in this branch originated to consumers living in rural or underserved areas as the percentage of population living in rural or underserved areas in that county. Note that the 4,100 includes creditors that do not qualify as small but for the final rule.

The figure is the same for larger creditors.", 
        "56": "A commenter suggested that smaller creditors might be originating more loans for smaller amounts (the commenter suggested a threshold of $40,000). According to the Bureau's analysis, while it might be true that smaller creditors make a disproportionate number of smaller amount loans, the majority of the smaller loans are made by larger creditors, and a sizable portion of smaller loans are made by creditors that already enjoy the special provisions under the currently effective rules.", 
        "57": "Instead of extending more credit, relationship lenders might be extending cheaper credit if they believe that their consumers are, effectively, less risky. In that case, given similar credit-risk profiles, the Bureau could expect that smaller creditors provide cheaper loans. However, higher-priced mortgage loans comprise on average 8.3 percent of the portfolio of creditors that are deemed small due to the final rule and 22.2 percent of the portfolio of creditors that are deemed small and rural due to the final rule. In comparison, the figure for larger creditors is 4.0 percent.",

In 2013, there were about 400 tracts where the only HMDA-reported loans originated were portfolio loans (out of the roughly 73,000 tracts in HMDA). About 200 of these tracts had more than one loan originated in 2013. These 400 tracts had fewer than 1,000 loans between them; of these loans, about 400 were made by creditors that originate over 5,000 loans a year and about 300 were made by creditors that made fewer than 500 loans a year.",

This type of risk is almost fully hedged by choosing an appropriate index for a 5/5 adjustable-rate mortgage. The second type of risk is the risk of the deterioration of the consumer's idiosyncratic conditions. For example, if the consumer's credit profile deteriorates or the consumer loses their job, their fixed rate will be too cheap for that consumer's current conditions. Arguably, creditors can project this risk better than individual consumers and are the lowest cost-avoiders, especially if one assumes that moral hazard is not a major concern in this situation (that consumers are not more likely to lose a job simply because they know that their mortgage is a 30-year loan as opposed to a 5-year balloon loan).",

A national association of credit unions noted many credit unions develop their forward-looking strategies with a two- or three-year outlook and was concerned that the proposal will curtail a credit union's ability to do such planning. For the same reason, this commenter suggested extending the effective date of this rulemaking to January 1, 2017 if the three-year lookback is replaced with a one-year period. A national association and a state association of banks both noted some of their members operate close to the 50 percent threshold and that a three-year lookback would prevent these lenders from abruptly halting their loan originations should they come close to approaching the loan threshold or otherwise become concerned that they may not meet the more than 50 percent test in a given year. The state banking association recommended a six-month grace period if the Bureau adopts the one-year lookback period to allow community banks to make necessary product and system adjustments and train staff.

                        "The Bureau considered comments requesting the continuation of the three-year lookback but has not adopted this approach in the final rule. As originally adopted in the January 2013 Escrows Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) considered only the preceding year and established a one-year lookback period. The Bureau instituted the three-year lookback period to stabilize the escrow exemption during the period from 2013 to 2015 while the definitions were under review. 78 FR 60382, 60416 (Oct. 1, 2013). This change guaranteed eligibility for a creditor that was eligible during 2013 with respect to operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas and met the other applicable criteria through 2015. Stability in this specific period was a particular concern because during the definitional review the first year-to-year transition in the \u201crural\u201d definition for purposes of this exemption was to coincide with the shift in the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service's (USDA-ERS) county Urban Influence Code (UIC) designations that occur once every decade.", 
                        "Once the definitional review period ends, the Bureau believes that using a three-year lookback period on a permanent basis would allow creditors to maintain eligibility even if their first-lien covered transactions do not meet the more than 50 percent test in most calendar years. That result would be contrary to the goal of identifying creditors that focus their activity in rural or underserved areas.", 
                        "Although the three-year lookback period provides creditors with certainty that they will be eligible for the exemption at least two years into the future, the Bureau does not believe that such extended notice will be necessary once the revisions to the definitions are effective. As explained in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), below, the areas that are rural under the definition would only change once or twice a decade.\n            While the counties defined as underserved could change each year, such shifts are unlikely to affect many creditors' eligibility for the special provisions and exemptions because very few counties would be underserved but not rural under the Bureau's definitions. Furthermore, creditors can monitor the first-lien covered transactions that they originate throughout the year using the Bureau's automated tool and should generally be able to anticipate any change in their eligibility well before the end of the year. Any changes that would be made in the rural definition after each decennial census would be based on demographic shifts that have unfolded over the preceding decade and which may, in many instances, be evident to creditors serving those areas. The changes would be announced well before they become effective, allowing time for creditors to assess their status and make appropriate transitions. The Bureau therefore believes that the preceding calendar year is the appropriate time period to use as a general rule in assessing whether the more than 50 percent test is met.", 
                        "The Bureau acknowledges that in some cases, a creditor could find out on or close to December 31st that it was not operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas during that calendar year. Such a creditor might have difficulty transitioning from balloon-payment loans to adjustable-rate mortgages and complying with the higher-priced mortgage loan escrow requirements by January 1 if eligibility for the special provisions and exemptions is based solely on transactions in the preceding calendar year. The Bureau therefore is adopting the proposed grace period that allows a creditor making a higher-priced mortgage loan based on an application received before April 1 to rely on its transactions from either the preceding calendar year or the next-to-last calendar year to meet the more than 50 percent test in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A).", 
                        "A creditor that is otherwise eligible and that met the more than 50 percent test in calendar year one but fails to meet it in calendar year two remains eligible with respect to applications received before April 1 of calendar year three. The Bureau considered comments requesting longer grace periods of six months or one year, but the Bureau is adopting this provision as proposed. Most of the comments received favored the grace period as proposed, and the Bureau believes that a grace period of this nature facilitates the transition of creditors that no longer operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas and properly balances the importance of the substantive consumer protections provided by the higher-priced mortgage loan escrows requirement, the ability-to-repay requirement, and the high-cost mortgage requirements with concerns that have been raised regarding their potential impact on access to credit."

The Bureau also proposed to exclude loans held in portfolio by the creditor or its affiliates from the limit, so that the limit would only apply to loans that were sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred by the creditor or its affiliates to another person, or subject to a commitment to be acquired by another person. The Bureau also proposed to add a grace period from calendar year to calendar year to allow an otherwise eligible creditor that exceeded the origination limit in the preceding calendar year to continue to operate as a small creditor with respect to transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year if the creditor had not exceeded it in the calendar year before the preceding calendar year.",

The Bureau stated that small creditors serve a particularly critical function for consumers in rural and underserved areas, especially when these creditors make portfolio loans for which there may be no secondary market. At the same time, the Bureau recognized that an expansion of the origination limit could undermine the Bureau's title XIV regulatory protections.

One national trade association stated, for example, that its internal analysis suggested that the Bureau approximated a good target through the proposed 2,000 origination limit. It stated further that from informal polling of its smaller community bank members, 1,000 loan originations per year is a common volume at banks of asset sizes below $1 billion, and that many may originate more. A state banking association agreed, stating that the Bureau's proposal better aligned the origination limit with the asset limit. This commenter stated that the current rule limiting originations to 500 covered transactions for institutions with up to $2 billion in assets does not reflect the business models of most community banks. A national association of credit unions, in expressing support for increasing the origination limit to 2,000 loans, stated that, because a large number of its members with assets under $2 billion originate more than 500 first-lien mortgages, it had long sought an increase in the origination threshold. Another state banking association stated that the increased origination limit will qualify more institutions as small creditors and promote the availability of mortgage credit for their customers.",

One national association of credit unions, for example, encouraged the Bureau to provide impact analyses that demonstrate how communities, consumers, and creditors would be affected if the limit were raised to 2,500, 3,000, 3,500, or 4,000, as well as the proposed threshold of 2,000, so that stakeholders and the Bureau would have more informed comments regarding what the new limit should be. Some state associations of credit unions suggested that the Bureau raise the limit to 5,000 loans, stating that a threshold at that level is more in line with the reality of credit unions that continue to maintain the virtues of a small creditor, including an elevated level of service and personal attention to borrowers.", 
                        "Some state associations of credit unions suggested that the Bureau allow institutions with default rates of, for example, less than 1 percent of covered transactions in the previous calendar year to make up to 4,000 mortgage loans per year and still qualify for the small creditor exemption.", 
                        "Consumer groups opposed or expressed concern regarding the proposed increase in the origination limit. Some cited a lack of an evidentiary basis to support the expansion of the origination limit, asserting that the Bureau did not provide any evidence that the current limit unreasonably constrains small creditors.", 
                        "Several consumer organizations in a joint comment expressed concern about the expansion of the origination limit to 2,000 loans, with a specific focus on past practices and lack of regulatory oversight with regard to non-depository institutions. They stated that, in the past, the absence of oversight by federal financial regulators, when combined with inconsistent or weaker state oversight, created an environment where non-depository institutions, in particular, had improper incentives to push consumers into mortgage loans with problematic features. The joint commenters encouraged the Bureau to limit the increase of the origination limit to depository institutions exclusively.",

A national association of banks stated that this exclusion is consistent with the rule's overall goals of ensuring safe lending while promoting credit accessibility. It stated that the success and livelihood of community banks are dependent upon repayment of their portfolio loans and that community banks carefully underwrite these loans based on knowledge of their communities and standards that meet local customer needs. It also noted the sound lending practices of &#8220;hometown banks&#8221; as demonstrated by their persistently low default and foreclosure rates, even through the recent mortgage crisis. These comments were echoed by several state banking associations.",

It also stated that raising the small creditor origination limit from 500 to 2,000 loans, and more importantly, excluding loans originated and held in portfolio from that threshold, will provide effective and significant regulatory relief for community bank portfolio lenders.", 
                        "A coalition of mid-size banks stated that this aspect of the proposal rests on the understanding that a creditor retains the risk associated with its portfolio loans and therefore has a natural incentive to underwrite such loans deliberately and under conservative standards. It stated further that this incentive is magnified for small and mid-size banks, which have substantially lower capital cushions than their larger counterparts to absorb losses in connection with default. A state association of banks stated that the Bureau is moving in the \u201cright direction\u201d with many of its proposals, but recommended that the Bureau exclude from the origination limit loans transferred by a creditor to a wholly-owned subsidiary.",

                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Increase of origination limit to 2,000 loans.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau believes that small creditors serve a critical function for consumers in rural and underserved areas, especially when these creditors make portfolio loans for which there may be no secondary market and that larger creditors may not be willing to make. Industry comments on the current small creditor origination limit indicate that it may be restricting the ability of such creditors with relationship lending models to provide needed credit to qualified borrowers in rural and underserved areas. The intent of the small creditor test is to facilitate lending by those small creditors that provide responsible, affordable credit to consumers, and to enable consumers in rural and underserved areas to access creditors with a lending model, operations, and products that may meet their particular needs.", 
                        "The Bureau has considered those industry comments that suggested raising the limit above 2,000 loans, or raising the limit above 2,000 loans for institutions with lower default rates. The Bureau seeks to avoid setting the origination limit, however, at a level that will allow larger creditors to take advantage of small-creditor status. The Bureau's primary goal in setting the limit is to draw the appropriate line between small and large creditors, and to strike the right balance between preserving consumer access to credit and maintaining effective consumer protections. The Bureau believes that the 2,000 non-portfolio loan limit strikes that balance.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing the origination limit as proposed, applying equally to depository institutions and non-depository institutions, as does the current rule. Excluding non-depository institutions from the changes to the origination limit, as suggested by some consumer groups, would require the Bureau to establish, and oversee, two different regulatory schemes for banks and non-banks. This introduction of complexity into the determination of small creditor status would subject similar regulated entities to different regulatory requirements, possibly creating creditor confusion regarding compliance, resulting in increased burden and compliance costs for such creditors. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act sets out as one of the objectives for the Bureau enforcing federal consumer financial law consistently without regard to charter type.\n            \n          ", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Exclusion of portfolio loans from the limit.</em> The Bureau's proposal to exclude loans held in portfolio by the creditor and its affiliates recognizes that the interests of small portfolio lenders are more likely to be aligned with the interests of consumers because small portfolio lenders retain the credit risk for loans held in portfolio. The Bureau has also recognized that many small creditors use a lending model based on maintaining ongoing relationships with their customers and therefore may have a more comprehensive understanding of the financial circumstances of their customers. The Bureau's exclusion of portfolio loans from the origination limit, therefore, is a recognition not only of the small creditor's community-based focus and commitment to relationship-based lending, but also of the inherent alignment of creditors' and consumers' interests associated with portfolio lending by smaller institutions. The Bureau is therefore adopting the exclusion of portfolio loans from the origination limit as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau believes the final rule provides a bright-line approach for determining what is included in the 2,000-origination limit. The Bureau also believes that the bright-line nature of this rule would be undermined by the commenter's recommendation described above that the Bureau not count toward the limit loans transferred by the creditor to its wholly-owned subsidiary. A transfer of a loan by a creditor to a subsidiary, or other affiliate, is not a loan held in the creditor's portfolio. Rather, it is a loan that is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred by the creditor to another legal entity in this particular situation (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.2(a)(22), the definition of &#8220;person&#8221; under Regulation Z). Making distinctions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and other affiliates for purposes of the origination limit would create compliance and oversight complications for creditors, their affiliates, and regulators, for example, because whether a subsidiary is &#8220;wholly-owned&#8221; could be a complicated analysis in some circumstances.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Grace period for transactions with applications received before April 1st of current calendar year.</em> The Bureau is adopting its proposed grace period to allow a creditor that exceeded the origination limit in the preceding calendar year to operate, in certain circumstances, as a small creditor with respect to transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year. The Bureau has considered commenters' suggestions for a longer grace period but believes the grace period should provide sufficient time for creditors to make any needed adjustments to come into compliance with the Bureau's regulatory requirements upon exceeding the origination limit. Further, the focus of the grace period on transactions with applications received before April 1, rather than transactions consummated before April 1, will mean that creditors will be able to consummate as small creditors not only transactions that were pending in their pipeline at the beginning of the calendar year but also transactions well into the current calendar year, as long as the application for a transaction was received before April 1 of the current calendar year. For example, if a creditor received a loan application in mid-March of the current calendar year, it could consummate that loan transaction as a small creditor 60 or 90 days later, in mid-June or July of the current calendar year.", 
                        "This final rule is also making several additional technical and clarifying language changes to \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) from the proposed rule, for example, changing the phrase \u201coriginated . . . covered transactions\u201d to \u201cextended . . . covered transactions,\u201d to make the language of that section consistent with the terminology generally used in Regulation Z. In addition, this final rule makes several technical and clarifying amendments to comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.ii, including, for example, technical changes for purposes of consistency between the regulatory text at \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) and the commentary, and additional guidance regarding the definition of \u201caffiliate.\u201d The comment states that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), \u201caffiliate\u201d has the same meaning as in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5), which defines \u201caffiliate\u201d as \u201cany company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>).&#8221; The commentary also sets out the definition of &#8220;control&#8221; under the Bank Holding Company Act.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that this final rule sets the origination limit in an effective and responsible way. As discussed, the Bureau's intent in setting the origination limit is to include small creditors that can provide responsible, affordable credit to consumers and enable consumers, particularly those in rural and underserved areas, to access creditors with a lending model, operations, and products that may meet their particular needs. As further discussed in the section 1022(b) analysis in part VII below, the Bureau estimates that expanding the origination limit to 2,000 originations, and not including portfolio loans in that originations count, will increase the number of small creditors by 700, from approximately 9,700 to approximately 10,400. The Bureau believes that this increase will include creditors with the size and responsible lending models that fit the purpose of small-creditor status that the Bureau intends."

                        "The Bureau did not propose a change to the current $2 billion asset limit in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C). The Bureau, however, did propose to amend \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) to include in the calculation of the $2 billion asset limit the assets of the creditor's affiliates that originate covered transactions secured by a first lien. Proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii provided that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), in addition to the creditor's assets, only the assets of a creditor's \u201caffiliate\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5) that originates covered transactions as defined by \u00a7 1026.43(b)(1) secured by a first lien would be counted toward the asset limit.", 
                        "In proposing this change, the Bureau noted that counting both the creditor's assets and the assets of the creditor's affiliates that originate mortgage loans would make the tests for determining small-creditor status consistent as between the asset limit in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) and the origination limit in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), which currently includes the originations of the creditor's affiliates in determining whether the limit has been exceeded. The Bureau stated that this added consistency between the two tests could facilitate creditor compliance with the special provisions and exemptions for small creditors, including those that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.", 
                        "The Bureau also stated its belief, that given the proposed change to the origination limit to exclude the creditor's and its affiliate's portfolio loans from counting toward that limit, the proposed change to the asset limit is necessary to ensure that small-creditor status does not become a means for larger creditors, through the development of affiliate relationships, to evade important consumer protections.", 
                        "The Bureau stated that it was interested in receiving comments on the proposed change's potential impact on creditors and access to credit. The Bureau also sought comment on the potential for larger creditors to obtain small-creditor status without this change and the possible impact on consumers.",

This proposed grace period allowed an otherwise eligible creditor that exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year to continue to operate as a small creditor with respect to transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year. This proposed grace period was available to creditors that exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year but had not exceeded it in the calendar year before the preceding calendar year.

The proposed comment explained further that creditors that did not satisfy the applicable asset limit on December 31, 2015 satisfy the asset limit during 2016 if the application for the loan was received before April 1, 2016 and the creditors had total assets under the applicable asset limit on December 31, 2014.

Specifically, a joint comment from three consumer organizations stated that as a result of the current rule's exclusion of affiliated assets in calculating the small creditor asset limit, very large financial institutions can create unlimited smaller affiliates and have each of them qualify as a small creditor under the rule. The comment stated further that this is a significant loophole that undermines the consumer protections created by the ability-to-repay rule and the accompanying qualified mortgage designation. Another consumer organization commenter stated that aggregating the loans for all affiliated lenders is an important anti-evasion device that preserves the &#8220;valuable&#8221; small creditor exemption, while preventing its abuse.",

The proposal, these commenters asserted, effectively lowers the threshold limit for financial institutions with affiliates.", 
                        "Credit union commenters were concerned with the impact of the proposal on the eligibility of credit unions for small creditor status. A particular concern was regarding those credit unions with affiliated credit union service organizations (CUSOs), with some credit union commenters suggesting that the Bureau exclude CUSOs from treatment as \u201caffiliates\u201d for purposes of the asset limit. In support of different treatment for CUSOs, a credit union trade association commenter distinguished CUSOs from other affiliates, stating that they are limited in scope and purpose. This commenter alternatively requested clarification on how to calculate the asset limit in the case of a CUSO that is owned by multiple credit unions, if the Bureau adopted the proposal. Some credit unions pointed to the Bank Holding Company Act, and the reference to that Act in the Regulation Z definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d that was cited in the proposed rule, as a basis for excluding CUSOs from the asset limit calculation, stating that the Act does not apply to credit unions.",

This change would also make the asset limit calculation more consistent with the origination limit calculation, which currently includes the originations of the creditor's affiliates.", 
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) as proposed but with several technical revisions. The final rule changes from the proposed rule the phrase \u201cthe creditor and its affiliates that originate covered transactions\u201d to \u201cthe creditor and its affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions\u201d in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) to make the language of that section more consistent with the terminology generally used in Regulation Z. This change also provides greater clarity that, as stated in the proposed rule,\n            only the assets of the creditor's affiliates that originate covered transactions, and not the assets of other affiliates of the creditor, count toward the limit. The change also indicates that there is a difference between how the covered transactions of affiliates are counted for purposes of the originations limit and how the assets of affiliates are counted for purposes of the asset limit. The originations limit requires a creditor to count each affiliate's first-lien covered transactions that were sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person, or that were subject at the time of consummation to a commitment to be acquired by another person. For purposes of the asset limit, a creditor counts only the assets of those affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions and not the assets of other affiliates. This difference prevents the assets of an affiliate that does not regularly extend covered transactions from having a significant impact on the asset limit for a creditor.", 
                        "To provide additional guidance, the final rule also makes several additions and clarifications to comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.A states that only the assets of a creditor's \u201caffiliate\u201d (as defined by \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)) that regularly extended covered transactions (as defined by \u00a7 1026.43(b)(1)) secured by first liens, are counted toward the applicable annual asset threshold. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.A also refers to comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.ii.C, which discusses the definition of affiliate under 1026.32(b)(5) and the definition of control under the Bank Holding Company Act referenced in that section. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.B states that only the assets of creditors' affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the applicable period for determining whether the creditor met the asset limit are included in calculating the creditor's assets. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.B then discusses the meaning of \u201cregularly extended,\u201d which is based on the number of times a person extends consumer credit for purposes of the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d in \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17), and provides examples on this point. Consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), because covered transactions are \u201ctransactions secured by a dwelling,\u201d an affiliate \u201cregularly extended\u201d covered transactions if it extended more than five covered transactions in a calendar year. Also consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), because a covered transaction may be a high-cost mortgage subject to \u00a7 1026.32, an affiliate regularly extends covered transactions if, in any 12-month period, it extends more than one covered transaction that is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1026.32 or one or more such transactions through a mortgage broker. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.C states that if multiple creditors share ownership of a company that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions, the assets of the company count toward the asset limit for a co-owner creditor if the company is an \u201caffiliate,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5), of the co-owner creditor. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii.C also states that if the co-owner creditor and the company are affiliates, the co-owner creditor counts all of the company's assets toward the asset limit, regardless of the co-owner creditor's ownership share. The comment also notes that because the co-owner and the company are mutual affiliates, the company also would count all of the co-owner's assets towards its own asset limit.", 
                        "While credit unions in their comments expressed concern about the impact of the proposal on credit unions affiliated with CUSOs, under the proposal only the assets of affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions are counted toward the creditor's asset limit. As adopted under the Bureau's final rule, therefore, only the assets of CUSOs that meet the definition of affiliate in Regulation Z (meeting the \u201ccontrol\u201d test under the Bank Holding Company Act) and that regularly extend covered transactions during the applicable period will be counted toward the asset limit. The Bureau is not excluding CUSOs from possible treatment as affiliates because it remains concerned that a credit union could, under the current asset limit calculation, enter into a relationship with a CUSO or CUSOs to create a large entity that would be eligible for the special provisions and exemptions accorded small creditor status. The Bureau also notes that \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5) and its definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d references the Bank Holding Company Act only for the purposes of how control is determined under that Act, which is applicable to the determination of affiliate under Regulation Z regardless of the applicability of the Act to credit unions.", 
                        "As noted, the Bureau did not propose to change the current $2 billion asset limit. However, as discussed, some commenters suggested that the Bureau increase that limit to correspond with the Bureau's proposed inclusion of the assets of a creditor's affiliates in the asset limit calculation, with several commenters suggesting an increase to $10 billion. The Bureau established the current $2 billion asset limit based on its belief that an asset limit is important to preclude a very large creditor with relatively modest mortgage operations from taking advantage of provisions designed for much smaller creditors with much different characteristics and incentives and that lack the scale to make compliance less burdensome. The Bureau believes institutions that fall under the $2 billion asset limit are more likely to be engaged in relationship-based community lending than larger institutions, with such small entities having a more in-depth understanding of the economic and other circumstances of their customers and community. The Bureau believes that allowing entities of up to $10 billion in size to take advantage of the exemptions and special provisions accorded to small creditors is inconsistent with the purposes of the special provisions and exemptions.", 
                        "The Bureau did not propose to exclude from the asset limit loans originated by a creditor or its affiliates and held in portfolio, or loans held in portfolio by a wholly-owned subsidiary of either. Given the final rule's exclusion of portfolio loans from the origination limit, also excluding portfolio loans from the asset limit could potentially allow a large creditor with significantly more than $2 billion in assets due to the size of its loan portfolio, or the size of its affiliate's loan portfolio, to take advantage of the special provisions and exemptions designed for smaller creditors. Such a change would run counter to the Bureau's intent in establishing an asset limit and the Bureau's intent to limit the ability of creditors who become large creditors through the development of affiliate relationships to circumvent consumer protections by obtaining small creditor status.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Add grace period for transactions with applications received before April 1st of current calendar year:</em> The Bureau is finalizing as proposed the addition of a grace period for the determination of the asset limit. It allows a creditor that exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year, but that did not exceed it in the year before the preceding calendar year, to operate as a small creditor with respect to transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year. The Bureau has considered comments suggesting a longer grace period but, as with the grace period for the origination limit, believes the grace period for the asset limit as proposed should provide the time for creditors to make any needed adjustments to come into compliance with the Bureau's regulatory requirements upon exceeding the asset limit in the previous year."

The current rule further provides that a creditor may rely as a safe harbor on the list of counties published by the Bureau to determine whether a county qualifies as \u201crural\u201d for a particular calendar year.

To implement this change, proposed \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) provided that an area is rural during a calendar year if it is (1) a county that meets the Bureau's current rural definition, or (2) a census block that is not in an urban area, as defined by the Census Bureau using the latest decennial census of the United States.",

The Bureau further proposed to update the example provided in comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.i to reflect the Bureau's proposal to add rural census blocks to the definition of rural area. Proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.i explains that an area is considered \u201crural\u201d for a given calendar year based on the most recent available UIC designations by the USDA-ERS and the most recent available delineations of urban areas by the Census Bureau that are available at the beginning of the calendar year.

A national organization representing banking supervisors and one representing real estate brokers and agents both recommended the Bureau establish an application process under which a person who lives or does business in a state may apply to have an area designated as a rural area. A national nonprofit organization that supports affordable housing efforts in rural areas noted that a reliance on Census Bureau classifications for rural areas may allow rural area determinations for lending activity that is actually suburban in nature, which may have the unintended consequence of diverting credit away from truly rural communities and consumers. This commenter recommended using a sub-county designation of rural and small-town areas which incorporates measures of housing density and commuting at the Census tract level."

Of these, the Bureau believes that the urban-rural classification completed by the Census Bureau every ten years is the most suitable for the Bureau's current purposes. This classification is done at the level of the census block, which is the smallest geographic area for which the Census Bureau collects and tabulates decennial census data. While there are only about 3,000 counties in the United States, there are approximately 11 million census blocks.\n            The Census Bureau delineates census blocks as \u201curban\u201d or \u201crural\u201d based on each decennial census and most recently released its list of urban areas based on the 2010 Census in 2012. For the 2010 Census, an urban area consists of \u201ca densely settled core of census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density requirements, along with adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core.\u201d\n            The Census Bureau identifies two types of urban areas: \u201curbanized areas\u201d of 50,000 or more people, and \u201curban clusters\u201d of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people. Under the Census Bureau's classification, \u201crural\u201d encompasses all population, housing, and territory not included within either type of urban area.", 
                        "The definition of \u201crural\u201d in this final rule maintains the bright-line, easy-to-apply county-based test from the current definition, while also bringing into the definition rural pockets within counties that are non-rural under the current rule.\n            Because the Census Bureau's classification is done at the census block level, it provides much more granularity than any county-based metric. To prepare the rural-urban classification, the Census Bureau uses measures based primarily on population counts and residential population density, but also considers a variety of criteria that account for nonresidential urban land uses, such as commercial, industrial, transportation, and open space that are part of the urban landscape.\n            Since the 1950 Census, the Census Bureau has reviewed and revised these criteria as necessary for each decennial census. The Census Bureau completes its rural-urban classification every ten years based on the results of the decennial census, on roughly the same schedule that the USDA-ERS uses in updating its UIC designations, which should provide a relatively stable but up-to-date measure.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that use of the Census Bureau's classifications provides consistency, certainty, stability, and objectivity to the \u201crural\u201d definition. The Census Bureau's classifications generally change only every ten years and, once established, provide a bright-line test that is not subject to discretionary judgments and manipulation, which could result under some commenters' more complex classification procedures, including those to establish an application process to have an area designated as a rural area. Used in conjunction with automated address search tools, as discussed more fully below, the Census Bureau's classifications allow the use of an easy-to-apply test, as originally provided under the county-based definition, to continue, thereby avoiding regulatory and administrative complexity."

The Bureau noted that the Census Bureau publishes maps, lists, and other reference materials on its Web site.\n            The Bureau also discussed how the Census Bureau currently provides on its Web site an automated address search tool that allows users to enter a property address to obtain census information about the property, including a designation that the property is in an urban area if that is the case.\n\n            The Bureau proposed that this automated tool or any similar automated address search tool provided by the Census Bureau could be relied on as a safe harbor. Specifically, proposed &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(C)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">3</em>) provided a safe harbor for a property not designated as located in an urban area as defined by the most recent delineation of urban areas announced by the Census Bureau through any automated address search tool that the Census Bureau provides on its public Web site for that purpose. Proposed comments 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.iii.B and .C discussed the safe harbors related to these online tools. Proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.iii.C clarified the calendar years for which the Census Bureau's automated address search tool can be used by noting that, for any calendar year that begins after the date on which the Census Bureau announced its most recent delineation of urban areas, a property is deemed to be in a &#8220;rural&#8221; area if the search results provided for the property by any such tool available on the Census Bureau's public Web site do not designate the property as being in an urban area. This is consistent with proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.i, which explains that an area is considered &#8220;rural&#8221; for a given calendar year based on the most recent available UIC designations by the USDA-ERS and the most recent available delineations of urban areas by the Census Bureau that are available at the beginning of the calendar year.",

Many commenters suggested the Bureau's proposed automated tool with a batch feature is necessary for compliance if the Bureau finalizes the definition of &#8220;rural&#8221; as proposed because small creditors do not have the capacity (or they need more time) to develop tools to integrate the new census block typology. One state banking association commenter suggested that the Bureau delay the effective date of the rule until the Bureau's proposed automated tool is available because identifying &#8220;rural&#8221; areas under the proposed definition of &#8220;rural&#8221; would be difficult for small institutions and presents a compliance risk that these institutions may not be willing to take. A national banking association and several state banking associations recommended an extension of the two year transition period, under &#167; 1026.43(e)(6), allowing small creditors to issue balloon-payment qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages regardless of whether they operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas, until banks can access the Bureau's automated tool.

One commenter criticized the accuracy and usability of the Census Bureau's automated address search tool but did not provide examples of inaccuracies. The commenter suggested that the Bureau use housing density and commuter information on a census tract level to define rural areas because a scheme based on the census tract level is more accurate. The commenter believed the Bureau's proposed automated tool would only add to the complexity of the proposed census block scheme used to determine \u201crural\u201d status.",

                        "The Bureau considered the comment regarding the availability of the Bureau's proposed automated tool by the proposed effective date, the concern that small institutions could not benefit from the expanded definition of \u201crural\u201d because they do not have the capacity to determine the rural status of a property under the new definition of \u201crural,\u201d and the suggestion that small institutions would not be willing to risk a compliance breach by trying to determine rural status without the Bureau's proposed automated tool. The Bureau also considered the comments recommending an extension of the two year transition period, under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6), until creditors can access the Bureau's automated tool. The Bureau expects that its automated tool will be available by the effective date of this final rule, which should address the concerns of these commenters. Further, the Bureau intends to provide guidance to industry stakeholders through implementation materials on how to access and use the Bureau's automated tool. In addition, creditors may use the Census Bureau's automated tool, or other means\n\n            besides the designated safe harbor tools, to determine the \u201crural\u201d status of a property as long as the creditor retains \u201cevidence of compliance\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 1026.25 of whether a property is in a rural or underserved area as defined in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B). <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.iii.B, .C, and .D discussed above.", 
                        "The Bureau also considered the commenters concerns about the Census Bureau's automated address search tool and their requests that the Bureau make available its automated tool before the effective date of this rule. As noted above, the Bureau expects its automated tool will be ready by the effective date of this rule, which should address the usability concerns about the Census Bureau's automated address search tool. Creditors are encouraged to use the Bureau's automated tool, which will have a user-friendly interface and a batch upload feature. One commenter questioned the use of the Census Bureau's automated address search tool and suggested the Bureau adopt a rural classification scheme based on the use of census tracts and factors such as housing density and commuting. The Bureau believes such a system would increase administrative burden and complexity and reduce the objectivity achieved by a definition of rural based on census blocks. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting such a classification scheme.", 
                        "Finally, one commenter believed the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(C) makes the use of the safe harbor tools mandatory. Creditors are not required to use the safe harbor tools. \u201cShall\u201d is used in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(C) to convey that a creditor who uses one or both of the tools receives a conclusive presumption of compliance with the Bureau's definition of \u201crural or underserved.\u201d Using the word <em data-original=\"E-03\">may</em> in this context would cause uncertainty with regard to the effect of the safe harbor tool's designation with respect to a particular property."

A national association of banks recommended a one-year extension to allow further study of the issue, and individual banks and credit unions stated a one-year extension would help them transition from balloon loans to adjustable-rate mortgage lending programs. A national banking organization and several state banking associations urged that the sunset be delayed until banks can access an official automated tool to identify rural areas, because without such an automated tool many small institutions would be incapable of ensuring compliance with the definitions, and may curtail or eliminate consumer mortgage financing."
