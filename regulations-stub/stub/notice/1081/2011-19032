                "This section requires the parties to meet before the initial scheduling conference to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, and other matters to be determined at the scheduling conference.",
                "Within 20 days of the service of the notice of charges, or at another time if the parties agree, the hearing officer and the parties are to have a scheduling conference. This section sets forth the issues to be discussed at the scheduling conference. These issues are drawn from those the parties are required to discuss at scheduling and prehearing conferences under the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.31, the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221, and the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21. Paragraph (b)(1) provides that the parties shall be prepared to address the determination of hearing dates and location, and whether, in proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act, the hearing should commence later than 60 days after service of the notice of charges. This provision was added to account for the requirement in section 1053(b) of the Act that the hearing be held no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice of charges, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Bureau at the request of any party so served. It is expected that the parties shall discuss a hearing date at the scheduling conference, and that this would afford respondents the opportunity to request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe.",
                "It is also expected that at or before the scheduling conference, the parties will discuss any issues related to the production of documents pursuant to \u00a7\u2009206, any anticipated motions for witness statements pursuant to \u00a7\u2009207, whether either party intends to issue documentary subpoenas, and whether either party believes that depositions will be necessary to preserve the testimony of witnesses who will be unavailable for the hearing. The parties are also expected to discuss the need and a schedule for any expert discovery.",
                "The hearing officer is required to issue a scheduling order at or within five days of the conclusion of the scheduling hearing, setting forth the date and location of the hearing, as well as other procedural determinations made. It is expected that the hearing officer will establish any dates for expert discovery in the scheduling order, or else expressly find that such discovery is not necessary or reasonable in a particular case. This scheduling order will govern the course of the proceedings, unless later modified by the hearing officer.",
                "Provision for a prompt scheduling conference followed by prompt issuance of a scheduling order is necessary in order to allow for the orderly course of proceedings on the timeline set forth elsewhere in the Rules. Particularly in cases brought pursuant to section 1053(b) of the Act in which the respondent does not request a hearing date outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the statute, it is essential that the hearing officer and the parties have a clear understanding of the applicable schedule at the earliest possible date.",
                "As provided for in the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.221(f), this section provides that any person named as a respondent in a notice of charges who fails to appear at a scheduling conference may be deemed in default pursuant to \u00a7\u2009201(d)(1). Finally, like the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.21(g), this section provides that scheduling conferences are presumptively public unless the hearing officer determines otherwise based on the standard set forth in \u00a7\u2009119."

Formal amendments to the notice of charges and answer are not required when an issue not raised by the notice of charges or answer is tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties. In the event that a party seeks to introduce evidence at a hearing that is outside the scope of matters raised in the notice of charges or answer, the hearing officer may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action unless the objecting party demonstrates that admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The Bureau has adopted this liberal standard to the amendment of the pleadings to promote adjudication on the merits, and believes that the standard set forth in the rule should adequately protect parties from undue prejudice."

The Bureau believes that an answer can help focus and narrow the matters at issue. Respondents must file an answer within 14 days of service of the notice of charges. The 14-day time period is adopted from the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.12. As in the Uniform Rules, 12 CFR 19.19(c), failure to file a timely answer is deemed to be a waiver of the right to appear and a consent to the entry of an order granting the relief sought by the Bureau in the notice of charges. This section provides that in the case of default, the hearing officer is authorized, without further proceedings, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice of charges and to enter a recommended decision containing appropriate findings and conclusions.",

In provisions modeled on the MARs and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see MARs, 11 T.M. Cooley L. Rev. at 96; Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a), this section also sets forth the circumstances under which the Bureau may voluntarily dismiss an adjudication proceeding, either on its own motion before the respondent(s) serve an answer, or by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared. Unless the notice or stipulation of dismissal states otherwise, a dismissal pursuant to this section is without prejudice. In keeping with the principle that Bureau proceedings are presumed to be public, this section also provides that a notice of charges shall be released to the public after affording the respondent or others an opportunity to seek a protective order to shield confidential information."

This section is intended to promote the principles of transparency and efficiency discussed with respect to \u00a7\u20091081.206. Note, however, that the respondent is required to move for the production of these statements.",
                "The Jencks Act does not require production of a witness' prior statement until the witness takes the stand. The Bureau expects that in most cases, the Division of Enforcement will provide prehearing production voluntarily. Submission of a witness' prior statement, however, may provide a motive for intimidation of that witness or improper contact by a respondent with the witness. The rule provides, therefore, that the time for delivery of witness statements is to be determined by the hearing officer, so that a case-specific determination of such risks can be made if necessary. Upon a showing that there is substantial risk of improper use of a witness' prior statement, the hearing officer may take appropriate steps. For example, a hearing officer may delay production of a prior statement, or prohibit parties from communicating with particular witnesses.",

                "Modeled primarily after the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230, this section adopts the SEC's affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery in administrative adjudications. Generally, this section requires that the Division of Enforcement make available for inspection and copying certain categories of documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement prior to the institution of proceedings from persons not employed by the Bureau, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings.",
                "The Bureau believes that this section will promote the fair and efficient resolution of administrative proceedings. A respondent's right to inspect and copy documents under this section is automatic; the respondent does not need to make a formal request for access through the hearing officer. Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings. The respondent will have access to the documents, testimony, and other information that the Bureau relied upon in determining to file a notice of charges, in addition to evidence that the Bureau will rely upon at the hearing.",
                "This approach has several advantages. By automatically providing respondents with the factual information gathered by the Division of Enforcement in the course of the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings, this provision helps ensure that respondents have a complete understanding of the basis for the Bureau's action and can more accurately and efficiently determine the nature of their defenses or whether they wish to seek settlement. Because this approach renders traditional document discovery largely unnecessary, it will lead to a faster and more efficient resolution of Bureau administrative proceedings, saving both the Bureau and respondents the resources typically expended in the civil discovery process.",
                "The section adopts most of the procedures and conditions set forth in the SEC Rules, as discussed below.",
                "Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), the Division of Enforcement's obligation under this section relates to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement. Documents located only in the files of other divisions or offices are beyond the scope of the rule. The term \u201cdocuments\u201d has been defined in the same manner as the term \u201cdocumentary material\u201d in section 1051(4) of the Act, and encompasses, among other things, electronic files or other data or data compilations stored in any medium.",
                "Paragraph (a)(1) also provides that the Division of Enforcement will make the documents available for inspection and copying. This provision is modeled after the SEC Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Bureau anticipates that in most cases it will simply provide either paper or electronic copies of the material at issue to respondents, but has adopted the formulation in the rule to preserve flexibility and the Division of Enforcement's right to require inspection and copying in appropriate cases.",
                "Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii) describe the types of documents that are subject to the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(1). Paragraph (a)(2) provides that the Division of Enforcement shall also make available each civil investigative demand or other written request to provide documents or to be interviewed issued by the Division of Enforcement in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. The Division of Enforcement shall also make available any final examination or inspection reports prepared by any other Division of the Bureau if the Division of Enforcement either intends to introduce any such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, any witness. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) are included in the SEC Rules, but have been broken out into a separate paragraph of this section because they do not comprise documents that the Division of Enforcement obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau, and thus do not technically fall within the scope of paragraph (a)(1).",
                "Pursuant to \u00a7\u20091081.208, a respondent may seek production of other documents pursuant to subpoena. Paragraph (a)(3) is intended to make clear that the affirmative disclosure obligation set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) does not preclude the availability of subpoenas as separately provided by the Rules.",
                "Paragraph (a)(4) provides that this section does not require the Division of Enforcement to produce a final examination or inspection report prepared by any other Division of the Bureau to a respondent who is not the subject of that report. The Bureau has added this provision, which does not appear in the SEC Rules, out of concern for the privileged and confidential nature of examination and inspection reports and to make clear that respondents cannot rely upon the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to require the production of supervision or examination reports concerning other persons. Although the disclosure obligation as drafted would not require the production of such reports, the Bureau is adding this provision to remove any question regarding the issue.",
                "Paragraph (b)(1) of this section permits the Division of Enforcement to withhold documents that would otherwise be produced under paragraph (a) under five exceptions. Exception (i) shields information subject to a claim of privilege. Exception (ii) protects as work product internal documents prepared by persons employed by the Bureau, including consulting experts, which will not be offered in evidence. Work product includes any notes, working papers, memoranda or other similar materials, prepared by an attorney or under an attorney's direction in anticipation of litigation. See Hickman v.  Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) and (b)(5). Accountants, paralegals, investigators, and consulting experts who work on an investigation do so at the direction of the Director, an associate director, or another supervisory attorney, and their work product is therefore shielded by the rule. Although such material would not fall within the purview of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the Bureau has retained this provision of the SEC Rule to make clear that such work product is not subject to the affirmative disclosure obligation. An examination or inspection report prepared by one of the Bureau's Supervision Divisions, which the Division of Enforcement intends to introduce into evidence or to use to refresh the recollection of, or impeach, a witness, is explicitly excluded from the materials that may be withheld pursuant to this exception.",
                "Exception (iii) protects the identity of a confidential source. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(C) and (D). Exception (iv) provides that documents need not be produced where applicable law prohibits their production. Exception (v) protects any other document or category of documents that the hearing officer determines may be withheld as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding, or otherwise for good cause shown. This exception is intended to provide the hearing officer with the flexibility to adjust the Bureau's affirmative disclosure obligation to the particular contours of a proceeding. For example, this exception could be used in a situation where a single investigation involves a discrete segment or segments that are related only indirectly, or not at all, to the recommendations ultimately made to the Director with respect to the particular respondents in a specific proceeding. To require that documents not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding be made available, simply because they were obtained as part of a broad investigation, burdens the respondent as well as the Division of Enforcement with unnecessary costs and delay.",
                "Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that paragraph (b) does not authorize the Division of Enforcement to withhold material exculpatory evidence in the possession of the Division of Enforcement that would otherwise be subject to disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a). Pursuant to this section, the Division of Enforcement will provide respondents with material exculpatory evidence it has obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau even if such evidence is contained in documents that the Division of Enforcement is otherwise permitted to withhold pursuant to paragraph (b)(1).",
                "The Bureau has declined to adopt the SEC Rules' explicit reference to Brady v.  Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) in this context. Proceedings under this part are civil in nature, not criminal, and the requirements of Brady are therefore inapplicable. The Division of Enforcement will turn over information from its investigatory file that was obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau as part of the investigation resulting in the Bureau's decision to institute proceedings, including any material exculpatory evidence so obtained. The Bureau understands this approach to be consistent with that provided for in the SEC Rules.",
                "The Bureau has also added the clause \u201cthat would otherwise be required to be produced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section\u201d to paragraph (b) to make clear that the material exculpatory evidence provision works in concert with paragraph (a), and does not impose a separate, free-standing obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence that is not otherwise within the scope of paragraph (a).",
                "Paragraph (c) provides that the hearing officer may require the Division of Enforcement to submit a withheld document list, and may order that a withheld document be made available for inspection and copying.",
                "Pursuant to paragraph (d), the Division of Enforcement is required to make the material governed by this section available for inspection and copying no later than seven days after service of the notice of charges. The Bureau has considered requiring production of the covered material at the time the notice of charges is served, but has decided against such an approach. A provision for a delay of no more than seven days will allow for the entry of any appropriate protective orders and is consistent with the SEC's approach in this regard. See 17 CFR 201.230(d). It is the Bureau's expectation that the Division of Enforcement will make this material available as soon as possible in every case.",
                "Paragraphs (e) and (f) set forth the procedure to obtain copies of documents and the costs of such copies. As noted above, the Bureau anticipates providing electronic copies of the documents to respondents in most cases, and paragraph (f) accounts for such a provision of electronic documents. In order to preserve the discretion of the Division of Enforcement, however, this paragraph includes provisions governing the inspection and copying of documents. In order to provide for the safekeeping of documents subject to inspection, and to control costs associated with the implementation of this section, paragraph (e) provides that documents shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Bureau office where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties may agree. In cases in which electronic production is unwarranted, this process appears more likely to result in prompt access to documents obtained by the Division of Enforcement that are the basis of the allegations contained in the notice of charges.",
                "In a provision added by the Bureau, paragraph (g) of this section imposes upon the Division of Enforcement a duty to supplement its disclosures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it acquires information after making its disclosures that it intends to rely upon at a hearing.",
                "Like the SEC Rules, 17 CFR 201.230(h), paragraph (h) provides for a \u201charmless error\u201d standard in the event the Division of Enforcement fails to make available to a respondent a document required to be made available by this section.",
                "Finally, paragraph (i) is modeled on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.31(g), and provides a \u201cclaw back\u201d mechanism whereby inadvertent disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall not constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection, provided that the party took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Furthermore, paragraph (i) provides that disclosure of privileged or protected information or communications shall waive the privilege only if the waiver was intentional and that the scope of such waiver is limited to the undisclosed information or communications concerning the same subject matter, which in fairness ought to be considered together with the disclosed information or communications. Paragraph (i) expressly applies to disclosures made by any party during an adjudication proceeding."

This section also makes clear that motions filed pursuant to sections that impose different requirements should follow those requirements, and the requirements of \u00a7\u2009205 to the extent they are not inconsistent. For example, \u00a7\u2009208(g), which relates to motions to quash subpoenas, provides for a shorter time period for the filing of a responsive brief and prohibits the filing of a reply unless requested by the hearing officer. These conditions govern motions to quash, but such motions are still subject to other provisions of \u00a7\u2009205, including, inter alia, the need to meet and confer, deadlines for the hearing officer's ruling, and length limitations of the briefs.",
                "Like the Uniform Rules and the FTC Rules, 12 CFR 19.23(d)(1); 16 CFR 3.22(d), this section gives a party 10 days after service of a non-dispositive motion to respond to such motion in writing. It provides for reply briefs, which must be filed within three days after service of the response. A party's failure to respond to a motion shall waive that party's right to oppose such motion and constitutes consent to the entry of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying that motion. This section adopts the SEC's 15-page length limitation for non-dispositive motions and oppositions, 17 CFR 201.154(c), and a six page length limitation for reply briefs. The Bureau has adopted these time and length limitations because they provide parties ample opportunity to express their views on matters that do not concern the ultimate disposition of the action.",

This time limitation is based on the FTC Rules, 16 CFR 3.22(e), and is intended to ensure the timely resolution of disputes so that the proceeding as a whole can conclude in a fair and expeditious manner. As noted above, both the FTC and the SEC have revised their rules of practice to provide for the more expeditious resolution of administrative adjudications, and the incorporation of a time period in which the hearing officer must rule on a non-dispositive motion is, in the views of the Bureau, a critical part of that effort. See 73 FR 58831, 58836 (Oct. 7, 2008) (FTC expects that provision requiring ALJs to decide motions within 14 days will expedite cases)."

The application must state that the witness is expected to be unavailable due to age, illness, infirmity or other reason and that the petitioning party was not the cause of the witness's unavailability. The Bureau has adopted the Uniform Rules' formulation of this standard, which provides for such depositions when the witness is \u201cotherwise unavailable,\u201d to account for the possible unavailability of witnesses for reasons other than those specified in the SEC Rules.",
                "Paragraph (a)(2) requires a party seeking to record a deposition by audio-visual means to so note in the request for a deposition subpoena. This provision is modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(3). Paragraph (a)(4) also provides that a deposition cannot be taken on less than 14 days' notice to the witness and all parties, absent an order to the contrary from the hearing officer.",
                "Paragraph (h) incorporates several provisions from the SEC Rules. It provides that the witness being deposed may have an attorney present during the deposition; that objections to questions of evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer, but that only the hearing officer shall have the power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevance of evidence; that the deposition shall be filed with the Executive Secretary; and that transcripts shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase.",
                "This section also incorporates certain procedures from \u00a7\u2009208 of the Rules pertaining to subpoenas. Those procedures are intended to protect against deposition requests that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, and to provide a mechanism for signing and service of a deposition subpoena, the filing of a motion to quash, and for enforcing subpoenas.",
                "The Bureau considered whether respondents should be allowed to issue subpoenas for the purpose of compelling prehearing discovery depositions as is allowed in actions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including deposition practice, is often a source of delay, extensive collateral disputes and high litigation costs. The Bureau believes expanding the scope of prehearing discovery to permit discovery depositions is not warranted for several reasons.",
                "First, the Bureau believes that even if limitations were placed on the availability of discovery depositions, there remains a significant potential for extensive collateral litigation over their use. Second, use of discovery depositions is in tension with the statutory timetable for hearings in cease-and-desist proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Act. Indeed, in part for this reason, the Rules allow the hearing officer to decide whether and to what extent to permit expert discovery in adjudication proceedings. Allowing prehearing depositions would present extreme scheduling difficulties in those cases in which respondents did not request hearing dates outside the 30-to-60 day timeframe set forth in the Act.",
                "Third, the rationale for permitting oral depositions in litigation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply equally to a Bureau administrative proceeding. In the typical civil action between private parties, where neither party can compel testimony prior to the filing of the complaint, oral depositions play a critical role in permitting evidence to be gathered prior to trial. Here, by contrast, the Bureau can compel such testimony and is committed to making it available to respondents pursuant to \u00a7\u20091081.206.",
                "Finally, these Rules include three provisions that address in significant part a respondent's interest in obtaining discovery prior to the start of the hearing. Section 1081.206 mandates that the Division of Enforcement generally make available not only transcripts of testimony, but documents obtained from persons not employed by the Bureau during the investigation leading to the proceeding as well as certain documents of the Bureau. Section 1081.208 authorizes the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for the production of documents returnable at any designated time or place. In addition, \u00a7\u20091081.210 provides for expert discovery in appropriate cases. Given these discovery mechanisms, the ability to subpoena witnesses to testify at the hearing, the ability to take the deposition of material witnesses unavailable for hearing, and the ability of respondents to conduct informal discovery, the marginal benefits of prehearing depositions are not justified by their likely cost in time, expense, collateral disputes and scheduling complexities."

A subpoena may only be issued by the hearing officer (as opposed to counsel) and the section sets forth procedures to prevent the issuance of subpoenas that may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome. The section also sets forth procedures and standards applicable to a motion to quash or modify a subpoena.",

In accordance with section 1052(b)(2) of the Act, which authorizes the Bureau or a Bureau investigator to seek enforcement of a subpoena, paragraph (h) only authorizes the Bureau\u2014and not the party at whose request the subpoena was issued\u2014to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena. Compare 12 CFR 19.26(c) (authorizing the \u201csubpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party\u201d to seek judicial enforcement). In a provision added by the Bureau, this section also provides that failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a subpoena constitutes waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought. This provision was added to prevent a respondent from declining to request that the Bureau seek to enforce the subpoena of a witness who fails to comply, and later claiming that his or her defense was prejudiced based upon the unavailability of that witness."

The Rule adopts the FTC's standard because it comports with the Bureau's goals of providing as much transparency in the adjudicative process as possible, while also protecting confidential business information or other sensitive information of parties appearing before the Bureau or third parties whose information may be introduced into evidence. The Bureau expects that the standard set forth in this section will be met in cases where the disclosure of trade secrets or other information to the public or to parties is likely to result in harm, but that the standard will not be met simply because the information at issue is deemed \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d by the movant.

Rather, they provide a clear, efficient mechanism for the conduct of adjudication proceedings, which benefits consumers because the Rules offer a systematic process for protecting them from unlawful behavior. The Rules are intended to provide an expeditious decision-making process, which will benefit both consumers and covered persons. The Rules adopt an affirmative disclosure approach to fact discovery, pursuant to which the Bureau will make available to respondents the information obtained by the Division of Enforcement from persons not employed by the Bureau prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings. This affirmative disclosure obligation substitutes for the traditional civil discovery process, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. The Bureau believes that the Rules, on the whole, will afford covered persons with a relatively inexpensive way to have their cases heard. The Rules are based upon, and drawn from, existing rules of the prudential regulators, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
