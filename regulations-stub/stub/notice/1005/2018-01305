        "494":"The Bureau recognized this issue in the proposal. In discussing potential alternatives to the proposed limited liability and error resolution regime, the Bureau considered and rejected several criteria for evaluating an account's riskiness, such as whether the account had been opened for a certain period of time or whether it received direct deposits, concluding that each had serious drawbacks. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 79 FR 77102, 77184 (Dec. 23, 2014).",

        "497":"Relatedly, the Bureau proposed to require that financial institutions include on the short form disclosure for all prepaid accounts a statement emphasizing the importance of registering the prepaid account. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) above.",
        "490":"As discussed above, these provisions were proposed largely unchanged from existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4)(ii) and (2), respectively. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> appendix A-7.",
        "491":"As discussed above, the FMS Rule requires that the issuer of a prepaid card that receives a Federal payment must comply with the error resolution and provisional credit requirements for payroll cards accounts in Regulation E. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 31 CFR 210.5(b)(5). The Bureau understands that prepaid cards that receive Federal payments and, as discussed previously, by extension many other prepaid cards that are eligible to receive Federal payments if the consumer so chooses, already comply with these provisions. In addition, the Bureau notes that the four major payment card networks' rules all impose some form of zero liability protections for cardholders in certain circumstances. At least one network, for example, requires provisional credit to be given after five days for unauthorized transactions occurring over its network, unless certain exceptions apply.",
        "492":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 13 tbl.3. Because these statistics weight all agreements equally, and thus do not reflect individual programs' or providers' market shares, the Bureau also specifically analyzed the 22 agreements for GPR card programs in the Study that belong to five of the largest program managers in the GPR card market. The Bureau found that 17 of these agreements provided full error resolution protections with provisional credit, three provided error resolution with limitations on provisional credit, and two provided error resolution without provisional credit. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See id.</em>",

        "21":"The Bureau understands that broker-dealers may also rely on the temporary exception because a SEC no-action letter concluded that the SEC staff would not recommend enforcement action to the SEC under Regulation E if a broker-dealer provides disclosures as if the broker-dealer were an insured institution for purposes of the temporary exception. The letter is <em data-original=\"E-03\">available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mr-noaction/2012/financial-information-forum-121412-rege.pdf.</em>",

The Bureau disagrees. The provisions in the Credit CARD Act that apply to gift cards were specific requirements that Congress mandated for the unique context of gift cards.
