                        "EFTA section 919 does not use consistent terminology concerning agents of remittance transfer providers.

The Bureau does not believe that these statutory wording differences are intended to establish different standards across the rule.

The final rule does not contain these suggested clarifications. The Bureau believes that because the concept of agency has historically been defined by common law, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable law regarding agents, including with respect to what creates or constitutes an agency relationship."

Because the definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d) of Regulation E applies only to financial institutions and includes inapt commentary, the Board proposed an alternative definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d applicable to remittance transfer providers. The proposed rule stated that \u201cbusiness day\u201d means any day on which a remittance transfer provider accepts funds for sending remittance transfers.",

In particular, financial institution commenters expressed concern that the date on which an institution \u201caccepts funds\u201d is unclear, because it could be interpreted either as the date on which funds are deposited into an account, or when the institution accepts a sender's order to transfer funds. Other commenters suggested replacing the proposed definition with a definition closer to the definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d) Regulation E. Upon further review, and for greater consistency among definitions, the Bureau is adopting a revised \u201cbusiness day\u201d definition in renumbered \u00a7 1005.30(b) as explained in related commentary that more closely tracks the general definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d), but that is tailored to the particular aspects of remittance transfers.",
                        "Specifically, \u00a7 1005.30(b) states that \u201cbusiness day\u201d means any day on which the offices of a remittance transfer provider are open to the public for carrying on substantially all business functions. Similar to proposed comment 30(b)-1, final comment 30(b)-1 clarifies that with respect to subpart B, a business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given under any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. However, comment 30(b)-1 states that a remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.",

For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard for subpart B for purposes of determining the number of days for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.",
                        "Comment 30(b)-3 clarifies that a provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day.

Finally, comment 30(b)-4 states that if a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the \u201csubstantially all business functions\u201d standard."

                        "EFTA section 919(g)(1) provides that \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d means \u201cany person located in a foreign country and identified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be made by a remittance transfer provider, except that a designated recipient shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of [the EFTA].\u201d Proposed \u00a7 205.30(c) implemented EFTA section 919(g)(1), with several edits for clarity. First, the Board proposal noted that a remittance transfer provider will generally only know the location where funds are to be sent, rather than where a designated recipient is physically located. For instance, although the sender may indicate that funds are to be sent to the recipient in Mexico City, the recipient could actually be in the United States at the time of the transfer. Thus, the Board stated that the statutory reference to a \u201cperson located in a foreign country\u201d should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent. Additionally, the statute references a remittance transfer \u201cto be made by a remittance transfer provider.\u201d As discussed below, the definition of \u201cremittance transfer\u201d requires that it be sent by a remittance transfer provider, so this language is unnecessary. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 205.30(c) stated that a designated recipient is any person specified by the sender as an authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country. The final rule adopts the proposed rule as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.30(c), but with additional explanatory commentary to address issues raised by commenters.",
                        "Proposed comment 30(c)-1 stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or a business. Several commenters argued that transfers to entities other than natural persons should be excluded, so that the rule would cover only consumer-to-consumer transfers. However, the statute clearly anticipates covering consumer-to-business transfers, as it defines \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d to include transfers to \u201cpersons,\u201d and does not limit its application to consumer recipients. See 15 U.S.C. 1693p(g)(1). The EFTA defines \u201cconsumer\u201d to mean a natural person, but does not define the term \u201cperson.\u201d Nonetheless, the EFTA uses the term \u201cperson\u201d in many provisions, and the context of how the term \u201cperson\u201d is used in those EFTA provisions indicates that it includes entities that are natural persons, as well as organizations. For example, the EFTA defines the term \u201cfinancial institution\u201d to mean \u201ca State or National bank, a State or Federal savings and loan association, a mutual savings bank, a State or Federal credit union, or any other person who, directly or indirectly, holds an account belonging to a consumer.\u201d (emphasis added). As a result, Regulation E has long defined \u201cperson\u201d to mean a natural person or an organization. See \u00a7 1005.2(j). The Bureau believes that the statute by using the term \u201cperson\u201d intended to cover remittance transfers sent by consumers not just to family members, but also directly to businesses abroad to pay tuition, mortgage, medical, utilities, or other bills or to fulfill other obligations. Accordingly, the final rule does not generally exclude consumer-to-business transfers where a remittance transfer provider is acting as an electronic intermediary. Instead, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(c)-1 to state that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.",
                        "Proposed comment 30(c)-2 explained that a remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State.\n          One money transmitter commenter noted that it may know the country to which a transfer is being sent, but not the specific payout location. The comment was intended to address the receipt of funds at a foreign location in the general sense; that is, any location that is outside of a State. Thus, the final comment, adopted as renumbered comment 30(c)-2.i., clarifies that a sender need not designate a specific pick-up location.",
                        "In addition, commenters requested further clarification for determining whether there is a designated recipient when a transfer is made to an account. For example, in a wire transfer transaction, commenters stated that the consumer requesting the transfer may only identify the recipient of funds by an account number or the location or routing number of the receiving institution. Other commenters argued that transfers to an account associated with an institution in a State should not be viewed as transfers to a designated recipient, even if a person in a foreign country has exclusive access to the account.",
                        "New comment 30(c)-2.ii. provides further guidance to address these issues. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, comment 30(c)-2.ii. states that whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country.",
                        "The Bureau concurs with the Board's statement that the statutory reference to a \u201cperson located in a foreign country\u201d should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent, and believes that comment 30(c)-2.ii. is consistent with this approach. Thus, the Bureau agrees that transfers to domestic accounts should not be considered transfers to a location in a foreign country. The Bureau also agrees that providers may not always know where a recipient is physically located at the time a consumer requests a transfer to be sent, and believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account, rather than the location of the individual recipient, creates an appropriate bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule, ease compliance burden, and most effectively accomplish the purpose of the statute to apply the provisions to transfers to foreign countries.",
                        "One commenter suggested revising the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d to exclude senders, such that transfers made by a sender to a sender's separate account abroad would be excluded. However, nothing in the statute indicates that the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient\u201d should exclude transfers to a foreign-based account of the sender. The Bureau believes that a sender would also benefit from disclosures indicating the ultimate amount to be received in a transfer, particularly where an exchange rate is applied. The final rule adopts comment 30(c)-3 to clarify that a sender may also be a designated recipient, such as where a sender requests that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country.",
                        "The Board solicited comment on whether there could be instances where a remittance provider may receive a recipient's email address but no other information to determine the location where funds are to be received. Several commenters affirmed this could happen. For example, one commenter stated that consumers can provide a recipient's email address to use its transfer service; while recipients must register with the provider to access the transferred funds, it is possible that the provider would not know whether the transferred funds will be received at a location in a foreign country until the funds are claimed.",
                        "Final comment 30(c)-2.iii. addresses this scenario. Where the sender does not specify information about a recipient's account, but instead just provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider must determine whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country based on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider has additional information at the time the transfer is requested indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as where the recipient's email address is registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer is to be received at a location in a foreign country.",
                        "Commenters also noted that, with regard to prepaid cards, the provider may not know at the time the prepaid card is purchased whether the funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. These commenters stated that where general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards or payroll cards are issued to two persons\u2014one person in a State and another person in a foreign country\u2014and both cards access the same funds, the provider may not be able to ascertain at the time of the request for the cards that funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. In this case, the issuer does not know at the time of the request the ultimate recipient of the funds.",
                        "The Bureau notes that funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are generally not considered to be an \u201caccount\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1005.2(b) of Regulation E. Thus, where the funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are held does not determine whether a prepaid card is being issued to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes when a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or a prepaid card program manager, issues prepaid cards, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program sends the prepaid cards, to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. Likewise, when a participant in a prepaid card program adds additional funds at the sender's direct request to prepaid cards that it or any other participant previously issued, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program has sent the cards to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate for a participant in the prepaid card program to determine whether the funds will be received in a foreign country based on where the participants have decided to hold the funds the cards access. The Bureau believes that such a rule would allow participants in the prepaid card program to circumvent the remittance transfer rules by holding the funds in a State. Under such an approach, participants in the prepaid card program would not be required to comply with the remittance transfer rules if the funds are located in a State even where prepaid cards that access the funds are sent only to recipients located in a foreign country.",
                        "In the case where two prepaid cards are issued to two persons\u2014one person in a State and another person in a foreign country\u2014and both cards access the same funds, the Bureau believes that the provider has sufficient information to determine that the funds will be received in a foreign country because it has sent one of the prepaid cards to a person in a foreign country. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 suggested that in this situation, the transfer would not be to a designated recipient because the sender retained the ability to draw down the funds on the prepaid card. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 is not adopted. The Bureau is concerned that if it adopted a rule that the transfer is not to a designated recipient in this case, a provider that sends prepaid cards abroad with the intent of providing a service where funds loaded in a State are intended to be accessed in a foreign country could circumvent the remittance transfer rules by always automatically providing a second prepaid card to the sender, even if the sender did not request a second card.",
                        "Thus, final comment 30(c)-2.iii. clarifies that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card. In this case, the prepaid issuer knows at the time of the request that a prepaid card has been sent to a recipient located in a foreign country. In contrast, if the provider provides the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country."

Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a de minimis exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (i.e., 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).",
                                "The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term \u201cnormal course of business\u201d covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.",
                                "In other contexts, regulatory coverage is triggered by a relatively small number of transactions. For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).\n          See 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17). Under State law, a single money transmission may trigger a requirement to register as a money transmitter.",
                                "The Bureau does not believe it has sufficient information on the frequency with which entities engage in remittance transfers to set a specific numerical threshold based on the current administrative record. Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing \u201cnormal course of business.\u201d Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.",
                                "While the final comment does not include a numerical threshold for \u201cnormal course of business,\u201d the Bureau recognizes that a bright-line number may ease compliance. Thus, in the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the Federal Register today, the Bureau is soliciting further comment on a potential safe harbor threshold."

Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E."

This revision is consistent with \u00a7 1005.2(b) and clarifies that the final rule does not apply to business-to-consumer or business-to-business transactions or to transactions that are not for personal, family or household purposes. For example, a transfer requested by a sole proprietor on behalf of his or her company would not be covered by the rule.",

Commenters also requested clarification on how to determine where a consumer is located if the transfer request is made electronically or by telephone, and where the consumer's presence is not readily apparent. To address these questions, new comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that for transfers from an account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of \u201csender\u201d in \u00a7 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that it might have, such as an address provided by the consumer.",
                        "One commenter asked the Bureau to clarify the application of Regulation E's comment 3(a)-3 to subpart B. Comment 3(a)-3 addresses the foreign applicability of Regulation E with respect to EFTs. The proposed definition of \u201csender\u201d and the proposed commentary did not address how comment 3(a)-3 would apply with respect to remittance transfers that are EFTs, such as international ACH transfers from an account. The statutory definition of \u201csender,\u201d and thus the definition in \u00a7 1005.30(g), does not turn on a consumer's residency; rather, the definition only requires that there be a consumer in a State requesting a remittance transfer. As with the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient,\u201d the Bureau believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account as a proxy for the location of the sender will create a bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule and ease compliance burden. Thus, as discussed above, under the final rule, for remittance transfers from an account, providers must look to the location of the account to determine whether there is a sender, and not the residency of the consumer requesting the transfer. Accordingly, final comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that the provider should make its determination notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3."

A remittance transfer provider must generally provide a written pre-payment disclosure to a sender when a sender requests a transfer. This disclosure provides information about the sender's remittance transfer, such as the exchange rate, fees, and the amount to be received by the designated recipient. A remittance transfer provider must also provide a written receipt to the sender when payment is made. This disclosure includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, as well as additional information, such as the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, and information regarding the sender's error resolution rights.",

Similarly, the information required on a combined disclosure need only be provided as applicable because the combined disclosure is simply a consolidation of the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. See EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Proposed comment 31(b)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider could choose to omit an inapplicable item provided in proposed \u00a7 205.31(b).

For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site.

As such, the final comment states that a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States transfers funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided.

The proposed comment also provided guidance applicable to the disclosure of both fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, which are discussed in detail below. See \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below. The proposed comment addressed the requirement that a remittance transfer provider only disclose fees or taxes as applicable. The proposed comment also stated that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes may be disclosed as one disclosure or as separate, itemized disclosures.",
                                "Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter argued that the Bureau should require itemized fees and tax disclosures. They believed itemized disclosures would help senders understand what costs are fixed, such as taxes, and what costs may vary depending on the provider, such as fees. However, another industry commenter stated that disclosing fees and taxes together provided senders with adequate information on the total cost of the transaction.",
                                "The Bureau agrees that separately listing the fees and taxes on disclosures provides better information to the sender about fixed and variable costs of the transaction, and the final rule provides that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) also clarifies that the fees and taxes must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. See \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i), above. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms \u201cTransfer Fees\u201d for fees and \u201cTransfer Taxes\u201d for taxes or substantially similar terms. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule is changed from the proposal to state that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term \u201cTransfer Fees\u201d or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes as \u201cTransfer Taxes\u201d or a substantially similar term.",
                                "One industry commenter argued that because a tax is imposed by the government, and not by the remittance transfer provider, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require taxes to be disclosed and, as such, the rule should not require disclosure of taxes. The Bureau believes the statute intended to require the disclosure of all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that would affect the cost of a remittance transfer to the sender. To the extent taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body are charged to the sender by the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes they are required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer. Even if EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) did not require that such taxes be disclosed to senders, the Bureau believes that disclosing the taxes imposed on the remittance transfer will demonstrate to the sender the calculation of the total amount that the sender pays for the transfer and how this amount relates to amount that will be received by the designated recipient and is therefore necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA. As such, to the extent necessary, the Bureau is also requiring these taxes to be disclosed pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). Therefore, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule clarifies that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body.",

The comment in the final rule states that a provider need only disclose fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as applicable.

Many industry commenters, however, urged that the final rule should accommodate floating rates and other circumstances in which an exchange rate may not be known at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer. A few industry commenters argued that the statute does not require the disclosure of an exchange rate set by institutions other than the remittance transfer provider. The commenters stated that by requiring the disclosure of the exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii) only requires disclosure of an exchange rate that the remittance transfers provider itself set for the remittance transfer.",
                                "For example, industry commenters stated that most credit unions offering international transfers do not perform currency conversions themselves, but instead rely on correspondent banks or other business partners to do so. Some industry commenters also stated that most credit unions offering international transfers work with currency providers in real time to contract for exchange rates. The commenters argued that this allows the credit unions to provide their members with the most competitive exchange rates. However, in such an arrangement the exchange rate that will be applied is only known at the time the contract is accepted, and would not be known at the time disclosures are provided to the senders. Similarly, other industry commenters stated that with their current processes and systems, they would know an exchange rate once a remittance transfer is processed, but not when the remittance transfer is requested.",
                                "Some industry commenters also stated the exchange rate cannot be determined at the time of the request when a sender designates the receipt of a transaction in one currency, but the receiving account is denominated in another currency. In those cases, the receiving institution must convert the funds into another currency in order to complete the transfer. One industry commenter stated that its customers sometimes request remittance transfers to be sent to their foreign accounts in U.S. dollars. These senders, however, have arrangements with the recipient institutions holding their foreign accounts to convert the funds to the currencies of the accounts either at the spot rates available at the time the accounts are credited or at rates pre-arranged by contracts between the senders and the recipient institutions. One industry commenter stated that, in some countries, a recipient may choose to be paid in one of multiple currencies. The commenter also stated that it permits consumers to change the designated country for pick up. In these cases, the currency in which funds will be received may change at the option of the recipient.",
                                "A Federal Reserve Bank commenter, as well as industry commenters, argued that requiring a fixed exchange rate for purposes of providing an exchange rate disclosure would result in less favorable exchange rates for senders. These commenters stated that if providers are required to fix the exchange rate, they will increase the spread they use in order to minimize the risks associated with rate volatility, so the cost of sending remittance transfers would increase for senders. One money transmitter commenter argued that requiring a disclosure of a fixed rate could also lead remittance transfer providers to stop providing services to some locations in which they have historically used floating rates. This commenter noted that such a requirement would require it to renegotiate its contracts with approximately 100 foreign agents representing about 10,000 locations that currently offer only floating rates. This commenter stated that this change would affect about a half million customers annually.",
                                "One industry commenter believed that a remittance transfer provider should instead be permitted to disclose that the exchange rate will be changed at the rate set by a daily central bank or other official rate plus or minus a fixed offset, such as a commission. Other industry commenters suggested permitting disclosure of an estimated exchange rate, as long as the provider also discloses that the rate is subject to change. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed that floating exchange rate products should be exempted from the disclosure provisions in the rule.",
                                "The Bureau interprets the statute to require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to the sender the exchange rate to be used for the remittance transfer to the sender, both at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer and when the sender pays for the transfer. This interpretation is based on several factors. First, the fact that the exchange rate may be set by another institution involved in the remittance transfer does not change the fact that it will be used by the remittance transfer provider in effectuating the sender's request. Second, the statute specifically requires disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. This disclosure requires a provider to determine the exchange rate to be used to effectuate the transfer, whether that rate is set by the remittance transfer provider or a third party.",
                                "The purpose of the statute supports the same conclusion. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the disclosure was intended to provide senders with certainty regarding the exchange rate and the amount of currency their designated recipients would receive. Senders would not be able to tell, for example, whether the funds they transmit are sufficient to pay household expenses and other bills where remittance products are based on floating rates.",
                                "The Bureau understands, however, that there may be instances in which a sender will request funds to be delivered in a particular currency, but the funds are later converted into another currency due to facts that cannot be known to the provider. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirement to disclose the exchange rate when it discloses information based on the request of the sender, even if the funds are ultimately received in a different currency. If the sender does not know the currency in which the funds will be received or requests funds to be received in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, the Bureau believes that the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. See also comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1, below.",
                                "Section 1005.31(b)(iv) of the final rule requires disclosure of the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, as proposed. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 clarifies that if the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.32, discussed below. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is \u201cunknown,\u201d \u201cfloating,\u201d or \u201cto be determined.\u201d",
                                "Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 further clarifies that if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge of the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may rely on the sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party.",
                                "Some industry commenters also argued that the exchange rate should be permitted to include more than two decimal places, consistent with their current disclosure practices. One industry commenter stated that providing exchange rates that include more than two decimal places provides senders with more accurate and detailed exchange rate information.",
                                "The Bureau agrees that it may be appropriate for some providers to disclose an exchange rate that includes more than two decimal places, because a provider may determine that the disclosure would provide a sender with a more accurate representation of the remittance transfer's cost, based on the particular type of transaction or type of currency being used. However, the Bureau also believes that some providers may determine that rounding to fewer digits may sufficiently inform senders of the cost of the exchange. The Bureau is also mindful that a disclosure that includes a long string of numbers could confuse some senders. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit a remittance transfer provider to disclose an exchange rate rounded to a number of decimal places that best reflects the cost to the sender, within a range that will not potentially confuse the sender.",
                                "Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) authority in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) to permit the exchange rate to be rounded consistently for each currency to no fewer than two decimal places and no more than four decimal places. The exchange rate must be disclosed using the term \u201cExchange Rate\u201d or a substantially similar term. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 of the final rule is revised to reflect the more flexible rounding requirements. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that \u201cUS$1=11.9 MXN\u201d in lieu of, for example, \u201cUS$1=11.90 MXN.\u201d",
                                "Though the Bureau is permitting flexibility for rounding exchange rate disclosures, the Bureau believes that each provider should disclose its exchange rates in a consistent manner. The Bureau believes that if a provider were permitted to round exchange rates for a particular currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis, a provider could round exchange rates differently in order to make the exchange rate appear to be more favorable. For example, the Bureau does not believe a provider that typically rounds to four decimal places for a specific currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.7551 Euros) should be permitted to round to two decimal places for some of those currency transactions (e.g., the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.76 Euros). Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 thus clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.",
                                "As discussed above, a provider may use an exchange rate that is not necessarily set by the provider itself. The final rule adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-3 to clarify that the exchange rate used by the provider and applied to the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.",
                                "Consumer group commenters and an industry trade association asked the Bureau to clarify how the exchange rate requirements would apply when a remittance transfer involves a prepaid card. These commenters asked how disclosures, such as the exchange rate, could be provided in accordance with the timing provisions in the May 2011 Proposed Rule when a provider would not know when the recipient would withdraw funds abroad or how much the recipient would withdraw. To the extent a prepaid card is covered by the rule, see \u00a7 1005.30(e), the funds that will be received by the designated recipient are those that are loaded on to the prepaid card by the sender at the time of the transaction. Often a prepaid card is both funded and loaded in U.S. dollars, and funds remain on the card in U.S. dollars until a cardholder withdraws funds in a foreign country. In these instances, a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), because a recipient will receive the currency in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. See comment 31(b)-1.",
                                "Finally, a Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that the exchange rate cannot be determined when a sender initiates payment on a recurring basis. The Bureau recognizes the unique challenges relating to recurring payments, and the final rule provides alternative provisions for these circumstances in \u00a7 1005.36, discussed below."

The Bureau received comments regarding concerns about making disclosures in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient.

The comment reflects the clarification in the final rule that disclosure under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies that two transfer amounts are required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v). First, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros.",
                                "Second, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, the comment also clarifies that this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if fees and taxes are not imposed for the remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, in such cases, there is no consumer benefit to the additional information if the transferred amount is not reduced by other fees and taxes.",
                                "Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) also requires a remittance transfer provider to use the term \u201cTransfer Amount\u201d or a substantially similar term to describe the disclosure required under this paragraph. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies, as proposed, that the terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.",

The Bureau does not believe it is intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v) is the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate not only the transfer amount in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), but also the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and the amount received in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures.

Because such fees and taxes affect the amount ultimately received by the designated recipient, the Board proposed the disclosure of other fees and taxes to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.",
                                "Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of third party fees and taxes to senders of remittance transfers, stating that such a disclosure would be consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and would best inform the sender of the amount the recipient would ultimately receive. In contrast, industry commenters opposed the disclosure. Most industry commenters argued that compliance with the proposed disclosure requirement would be burdensome, if not impossible. Commenters stated that financial institutions sending wire transfers and international ACH transactions only have control over the delivery to the next institution, and in some cases do not have a relationship with all of the subsequent intermediary institutions involved in a transfer or with the recipient institution. The originating institution may, in some cases, know the routing, but in other cases have no legal or technological means to control routing of a transaction once the transfer has been initiated and, therefore, it cannot know what institutions might be imposing fees or taxes on the remittance transfer. One industry commenter suggested that providing the disclosures may be possible for repeat wire transfers, because fee and tax information is known from the previous transfers, but not for new wire transfers.",
                                "Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that third party fees and taxes may not be known at the time of the transaction, which could result in the remittance transfer provider providing misleading information to the sender. Industry commenters also argued that smaller institutions do not have the resources to obtain or monitor information about foreign tax laws or fees charged by unrelated financial institutions that may be involved in the transfer. Some commenters noted that intermediary financial institutions, both inside and outside of the United States, are not required to disclose their fees. Moreover, some industry commenters argued, the sharing of fee information among financial institutions could violate privacy and competition laws. Industry commenters stated that no comprehensive information is available regarding foreign tax laws. Because an institution may not have resources to track tax laws in every foreign country to which it sends a remittance transfer, the commenters argued that some providers would limit the locations to which they send remittance transfers.",
                                "Further, some industry commenters noted that a recipient may enter into an agreement with a recipient institution that permits the institution to impose fees for an international payment received by the institution and applied to the recipient's account. The commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would not know whether the recipient has agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient may have agreed to pay. The commenters argued that such fees charged to a recipient by a third party pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and a third party should not be required to be disclosed.",
                                "Some industry commenters argued that the statute did not intend for third party fees and taxes to be included in the disclosure of the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient. For example, one industry commenter argued that the statute only intended to include in the calculation of the amount of currency to be received the elements specifically required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (i.e., the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, and any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer). Another industry commenter argued that State laws that require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the total amount to be received by the designated recipient do not require disclosure of third party fees and taxes that may be imposed on the remittance transfer. Instead, the commenters argued, State laws only require the remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of currency to be received after application of the exchange rate. Therefore, the commenters stated that fees or taxes set by a party other than the remittance transfer provider are not required to be included in the disclosure of the total amount received and, therefore, should not be required to be disclosed separately.",
                                "Overall, many industry commenters stated that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause financial institutions to withdraw from the market or restrict the locations to which wire transfers will be sent. The commenters also stated that the proposed requirements would increase costs to senders, and some argued that the proposed requirements would delay transactions while financial institutions determined the required information in order to make disclosures. Some industry commenters argued that the requirements put financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to money transmitters, which, they argued, are typically able to know the required disclosures due to their closed network structure. Further, they argued that the proposed requirements could deter foreign financial institutions from agreeing to process U.S.-originated remittance transfers.",
                                "Generally, industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt financial institutions that provide remittance transfers through correspondent relationships from the requirement to disclose third party fees or require different disclosures for these types of transactions. Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter also suggested that the final rule should incorporate a good faith standard with respect to these fee and tax disclosures. Some industry commenters further argued that the Bureau should not require foreign taxes to be provided, regardless of whether a remittance transfer was sent through a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau only require a disclosure that the amount received may be subject to foreign taxes. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter suggested that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for the foreign tax disclosure for providers that disclosed current or historical information available to the provider through reasonable efforts.",
                                "Commenters also suggested that the Bureau assist industry with determining unknown fees and taxes, particularly to help ease the disclosure burden on small providers. One industry commenter believed the Bureau should require correspondent institutions to publish the fees and taxes that are charged. Industry and consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should maintain a resource that provides relevant foreign taxes.",
                                "As discussed in the introduction above, the Bureau recognizes the challenges for remittance transfer providers to determining fees and taxes imposed by third parties. However, the plain language of the statute requires disclosure of the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau believes this requires remittance transfer providers to determine the costs specifically related to the remittance transfer that may reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Congress specifically recognized that these determinations would be difficult with regard to open network transactions by financial institutions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties.",
                                "This disclosure provides consumer benefits by making senders aware of the impact of these fees and taxes, which is essential to fulfill the purpose of the statute. Providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of third party fees and taxes, and separately disclosing those fees and taxes, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. For many senders and recipients, disclosure of the amount of third party fees and taxes that may be deducted could be crucial to knowing whether the amount transferred will be sufficient to pay important household expenses and other bills. Senders also need to know the amount of such fees and taxes to determine whether to use the same provider for any future transfers. Without such information, it would be difficult for a sender to determine the costs of the transfer that would enable the sender to choose the most cost-effective method of sending remittance transfers. Moreover, as discussed below, the cost of third party taxes may vary depending on the types of institutions involved in the transmittal route, and disclosure of these taxes will assist senders comparing costs between providers. While the Bureau understands that tax information may not be readily available to a provider, the provider is in the best position to obtain the information to comply with the disclosure requirements. Because a provider will be engaged in sending remittance transfers to certain countries and, in some cases, will have relationships with entities in those countries, the Bureau believes the provider itself is in the best position to determine foreign tax information.",
                                "Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi) of the final rule the disclosure of any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, using the terms \u201cOther Fees\u201d for fees and \u201cOther Taxes\u201d for taxes, or substantially similar terms.\n          As discussed above, fees and taxes must be disclosed separately from one another in order to show which costs are fixed and which costs are variable. See comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the fees and taxes in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.",
                                "As noted above, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed by the provider, discussed above in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), and the fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. The proposed comment provided examples of each of these types of fees and taxes. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. also clarified that the terms used to describe each of these types of fees and taxes must differentiate between such fees and taxes and provided an example to illustrate this differentiation.",
                                "Industry commenters requested clarification regarding the types of fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, an industry commenter and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that these fees and taxes do not include fees and taxes that banks and other parties charge one another for handling a remittance transfer, so long as the fees do not affect the amount of the transfer. Another industry commenter asked whether funds deducted from the amount received in a remittance transfer by a recipient institution exercising its rights of set-off would be required to be disclosed as a fee to a sender.",
                                "Comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. of the final rule clarifies that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed include only those that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. The Bureau does not believe that any fee or tax is required to be disclosed solely because it is charged at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent, because such fees and taxes are not necessarily \u201cimposed on the remittance transfer.\u201d For example, an overdraft fee charged by a bank at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent or received in an account is not imposed on the remittance transfer. In order to further clarify what charges should be disclosed to senders, the comment in the final rule provides examples of the types of fees that are not required to be disclosed under this provision, in addition to the examples of the types of fees that should be included that were included in the May 2011 Proposed Rule.",
                                "Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. states that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose a service fee and any State taxes imposed on the remittance transfer. In contrast, the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) include fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees and taxes that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, a provider must disclose fees imposed on a remittance transfer by the receiving institution or agent at pick-up for receiving the transfer, fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer, and taxes imposed on a remittance transfer by a foreign government.",
                                "However, the comment states that a provider need not disclose, for example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt, because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not charged to the sender or designated recipient. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer need not be disclosed. The comment also clarifies that the terms used to describe the fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. For example, the terms used to describe fees disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as \u201cFees.\u201d",
                                "Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 clarified how a provider must disclose fees and taxes in the currency in which funds will be received. Industry commenters expressed concern that a remittance transfer provider may not know the currency in which the funds will be received. As discussed above in comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1, if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representations as to the currency in which funds will be received.",
                                "Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with an added clarification regarding reliance on a sender's representation regarding the currency in which the funds will be received. The Bureau is also revising the comment to reflect the clarification that disclosures that require an exchange rate to be applied should use the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.",
                                "Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 states that \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of fees and taxes in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A fee or tax described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee or tax to be disclosed using the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution in an international wire transfer may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer.",
                                "The comment further states that for purposes of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.",
                                "The final rule also adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 to address situations where the information needed to determine the foreign taxes that apply to a transaction is not known to the provider and not publically available. Some industry commenters stated that foreign taxes may depend on variables other than the country to which the remittance transfer is sent, such as by the specific tax status of the sender and receiver, account type, or type of financial institution. The commenters stated that a sender may not be aware of the information needed to determine the tax obligation that applies to the transaction.",
                                "The Bureau believes that when these types of variables affect the foreign taxes that apply to the transaction, providers may have to rely on representations made by the sender. If the sender does not know the information, and the provider does not otherwise have specific knowledge of the information, the Bureau believes it is necessary to provide a reasonable mechanism by which the provider may disclose the foreign tax. The Bureau believes it is appropriate in these instances to disclose the highest tax that could be imposed with respect to a particular variable, so the sender is not surprised that the amount received is reduced by more taxes than what is disclosed.",
                                "Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 states that the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider may depend on the tax status of the sender or recipient, the type of accounts or financial institutions involved in the transfer, or other variables. For example, the amount of tax may depend on whether the receiver is a resident of the country in which the funds are received or the type of account to which the funds are delivered. If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the provider may rely on a sender's representations regarding these variables, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). If a sender does not know the information relating to the variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed for the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.",
                                "The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may rely on the sender's representations regarding these variables. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party. The Bureau also notes that a provider may continue to rely on the sender's representations in any subsequent remittance transfers, unless the provider has specific knowledge that information relating to such variables has changed."

As discussed above, an industry commenter argued that the statute only intended the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient to reflect the other elements that are required to be disclosed separately under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Other industry commenters argued that the disclosure should only reflect the exchange rate, fees, and taxes set by the remittance transfer provider itself, and not those set or charged by persons other than the provider. Some industry commenters believed the amount that will be received by the designated recipient should be subject to a good faith standard, should be permitted to be estimated, or should include a statement that the total amount is subject to change.",
                                "EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount received by the designated recipient using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. The Bureau interprets the amount to be received by the designated recipient as the amount net of all fees and taxes that will be paid for the transfer. An exchange rate, if one is applied, is just one of the factors that could affect the actual amount received by the designated recipient. Providing a total amount to be received that does not take into account all cost elements would not be consistent with the statute's goal of providing disclosures of the total costs of a remittance transfer.",
                                "The Bureau is not persuaded that the amount to be received by the designated recipient should only reflect those elements that are separately required to be disclosed under the statute. Under the plain language of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i), the amount of funds that will be received by the designated recipient must be disclosed to the sender. The Bureau believes this amount must reflect all fees and taxes specifically related to the remittance transfer, regardless of the entity that charges them. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the exchange rate to be used to calculate the total to recipient is the exchange rate that is used for the remittance transfer, whether or not the remittance transfer provider itself sets the exchange rate or merely applies an exchange rate set by another entity to the transaction. Absent this approach, providers could disclose different amounts received depending only on whether the provider itself or a different institution applies the exchange rate. The Bureau believes such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory goal of providing the sender with the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient.",
                                "Therefore, proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(1)(vii) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), with an addition to clarify the appropriate exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received, discussed below. Comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed to clarify the charges that must be reflected in the amount received. The comment is amended to clarify that the disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax, whether the fee or tax is imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider or by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The comment clarifies that the fees and taxes that must be disclosed are those fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer. See comment 31(b)(1)-1-ii. Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 states that the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient must reflect all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that affect the amount received, including the exchange rate and all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, the receiving institution, or any other party in the transmittal route of a remittance transfer. The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax that is imposed on the remittance transfer by any person, even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.",

One industry commenter stated that using a rounded exchange rate may add some de minimis value to the amount received. For some currencies, this may result in a transaction amount being disclosed in a foreign currency for which no coins are available to complete the transaction. The commenter recommended a de minimis exemption for error resolution triggered based on rounding. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) is the exchange rate in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.

EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires the disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient on a receipt. The Board stated its belief that the statute requires disclosure of the date the currency will be available to the designated recipient, not the date the funds are physically picked up by the designated recipient, because the recipient may not pick up the funds for some period of time after the funds are available. Thus, proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(2)(ii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the date of availability of funds to the designated recipient, using the term \u201cDate Available\u201d or a substantially similar term. Proposed comment 31(b)(2)-1 provided further guidance on this disclosure.",
                                "In the proposal, the Board recognized that in some instances, it may be difficult to determine the exact date on which a remittance transfer will be available to a designated recipient. For example, an international wire transfer may pass through several intermediary institutions prior to becoming available at the institution of a designated recipient, and the time it takes to pass through these intermediaries may be difficult to determine. As a result, the Board recognized that remittance transfer providers would likely disclose the latest date on which the funds would be available, even if funds are often available sooner. Thus, proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(2)(ii) permitted a provider to include a statement that funds may be available to the designated recipient earlier than the date disclosed, using the term \u201cmay be available sooner\u201d or a substantially similar term. The Board had tested various terms in consumer testing for communicating the fact that funds may be available earlier than the date disclosed. Participants generally understood the meaning of the statement that funds \u201cmay be available sooner\u201d better than other terms.",
                                "Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of the date funds will be available. Many industry commenters argued, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to determine when funds would be made available to a recipient in an open network system, such as where transfers are made to an account at a financial institution with which the provider does not have a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters argued that even if the date of receipt by a recipient financial institution is known, there could be a delay in depositing the funds into a recipient account due to delays at intermediary financial institutions or at the recipient institution. One industry trade association stated that infrastructure deficiencies in some countries may make it impossible to determine the actual date on which funds will be available.",
                                "An industry commenter supported the flexibility provided by the term \u201cmay be available sooner,\u201d but stated that dates still may be unpredictable for reasons beyond a provider's control. One industry trade association argued that in order to mitigate compliance risks, some remittance transfer providers will disclose a date well past a reasonable estimate of the date funds will be made available, which would render the disclosure meaningless.",
                                "Due to these factors, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit an estimated date of availability, including an estimate of the date that funds may be available to a recipient institution, and not the recipient. One commenter suggested that the disclosure could state that a transfer may be delayed by intermediaries or other factors beyond the provider's control.",
                                "As stated in the proposal, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires disclosure of a single, promised date of delivery of the funds. Neither EFTA section 919(a)(4) nor EFTA section 919(c) permit a remittance transfer provider to provide an estimate of this promised date, despite the fact that the statute permits estimates in other circumstances. Moreover, because the statute requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient, the Bureau believes that permitting a provider to disclose the date that funds will be made available to the recipient institution would not comply with the statute.",
                                "The Bureau believes that by permitting the provider to disclose a date by which funds will certainly be delivered, but also stating that funds \u201cmay be available sooner,\u201d a provider can comply with the disclosure requirement. The Bureau recognizes that providers may overestimate the disclosed date on which funds will be available to mitigate compliance risks. However, the Bureau believes that competitive pressures will give providers an incentive to provide as accurate a date as possible.",
                                "Therefore, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) is finalized substantially as proposed. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), however, clarifies in the rule, rather than the commentary, as proposed, that a provider must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient. This clarification is included to account for instances where time zone differences result in a date in the United States being different from the date in the country of the designated recipient.",
                                "The final rule also adopts comment 31(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may not provide a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available, nor an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds \u201cmay be available sooner\u201d or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier that the date disclosed. For example, the provider may disclose \u201cJanuary 10 (may be available sooner).\u201d"

EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a statement containing information about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of errors on the receipt or combined disclosure. EFTA section 919(d)(3) requires the Bureau to issue final rules regarding appropriate cancellation and refund policies for senders. The Board stated its belief that providing a lengthy disclosure to the sender each time the sender makes a remittance transfer could be ineffective at conveying the most important information that a sender would need to resolve an error or cancel a transaction. However, the Board also stated that a sender should have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights in order to effectively exercise those rights. As a result, the Board proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(2)(iv) in conjunction with a long form error resolution notice in proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(4). The two disclosures were intended to balance the interest in providing a sender a concise disclosure with the sender's ability to obtain a full explanation of those rights.",

These commenters also suggested that the abbreviated disclosure would not comply with the statute. One of the consumer group commenters stated that all of the senders' rights should be disclosed on the receipt, instead of a shorter disclosure, because senders of remittance transfers may be less educated or less likely to have access to phone and internet compared to other consumers.",
                                "The Bureau agrees that education of senders about the consumer protections created by EFTA section 919 is an important statutory and policy goal. However, the Bureau believes EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) does not require a remittance transfer provider to enumerate a sender's error resolution rights. Rather, the statute requires the provider to disclose information about the rights of the sender under EFTA section 919 regarding the resolution of errors, and the Bureau believes the proposed language satisfies this requirement. Moreover, consumer testing participants understood and responded positively to the concise, abbreviated disclosure and favorably compared the statement against current error resolution disclosures with which they had experience and which they noted could be long and in \u201cfine print.\u201d Thus, the Bureau is finalizing the abbreviated disclosure requirement in renumbered \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). See also \u00a7 1005.31(b)(4), below. The Bureau, however, is amending the language in the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights. The Bureau is also adding a requirement in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below.

Some commenters believed the disclosure of Bureau contact information would be sufficient.

This commenter stated that agents that provide services in multiple states often distribute forms to their locations as part of their chain of distribution. Requiring these agents to manage State-specific forms, the commenter argued, would be a significant change in distribution processes and could create liability risk for the remittance transfer provider. This commenter believed remittance transfer providers would thus create a multi-State disclosure form, which would provide senders with superfluous information.",
                                "Another money transmitter commenter noted that many states already have guidance regarding the prominence and placement of contact information on a remittance transfer provider's Web site and in storefront locations. The commenter stated that many states prefer senders to contact the remittance transfer provider before contacting a State agency for questions and complaints. The commenter believed that the Bureau should instead require a statement that would refer to other sources, such as a Web site or toll-free number, to obtain contact information for the appropriate State agency, and that the Bureau should maintain contact information for State agencies, so that senders could contact the Bureau for appropriate State agency information.",

The Bureau does not believe that providing contact information for an alternative source that maintains a list of State agencies would satisfy the statutory requirement. The Bureau recognizes that remittance transfer providers that have locations in multiple states, or that provide remittance transfers online or by telephone, will have to determine the appropriate State agency to disclose on a receipt. The Bureau believes that due to segregation and other formatting requirements, discussed below, a remittance transfer provider may not disclose contact information for agencies in other states. Therefore, the final rule maintains the requirement to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider.",

The Bureau is not requiring a separate disclosure of a primary Federal regulator in the final rule, because the disclosure of multiple Federal agencies could confuse senders. Instead, the Bureau believes consumers are better served by contacting the Bureau, which can direct senders to the appropriate Federal agency as necessary.

For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency and would solely disclose information about the Bureau, whether or not the Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.",

For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple states, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender."

A proof of payment would also help remittance transfer providers determine which transfers have actually been completed, so that a sender cannot assert error resolution rights based on a combined disclosure, where a sender has not made payment for the transfer. Thus, the Bureau is adding a proof of payment requirement to the final rule.",
                                "Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize the combined disclosure requirement. Section 1005.31(b)(3) states that as an alternative to providing the disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), a remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosures described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), as applicable, in a single disclosure pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1). If the remittance transfer provider provides the combined disclosure and the sender completes the transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The final rule also adds new comment 31(b)(3)-1, which clarifies that the combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The comment also clarifies that the proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made.",

The requirement to provide a sender with proof of payment is only intended to convey to a sender that payment has been received. To this end, new comment 31(b)(3)-1 also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received."

The Bureau believes it is appropriate to establish formatting requirements tailored to the elements required to be disclosed under the statute. Providers can separately comply with each State's formatting requirements, to the extent that they meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the final rule. The Bureau believes that the proposed formatting requirements will ensure that disclosures are clear and conspicuous as required under EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) and will thereby help senders understand the costs of remittance transactions.

These charges could make senders reluctant to make transfers via mobile application or text message and, therefore, create a disincentive for providers to make remittance transfers available through these alternative methods. They argued that the provider should have the flexibility to provide disclosures using various methods\u2014such as text message, mobile application, email, internet, or mail\u2014as long as the sender is capable of receiving the disclosures.",

One consumer group commenter stated that pre-payment disclosures were necessary to facilitate shopping.",
                                "Several industry commenters, however, opposed the requirement to provide disclosures before payment. One industry trade association commenter argued that the disclosure would provide negligible benefits, citing the fact that some participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they did not want a disclosure prior to payment. One industry commenter suggested that the pre-payment disclosures would confuse or irritate customers who would not understand why disclosure was being provided at that time. Another industry commenter stated that the pre-payment disclosures created needless compliance costs, which would be passed on to senders. As discussed above, some industry commenters urged that if pre-payment disclosures were required, that they be permitted to be disclosed orally or on a screen, even when the transaction is conducted in person, to reduce compliance costs and delays for the sender.",
                                "A few industry commenters argued that the combined disclosure should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. One industry commenter noted that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) only requires combined disclosure to be accurate at the time payment is made. This commenter stated that providing a document similar to a receipt prior to payment is not possible because such a disclosure could not provide accurate information regarding the date and time of the transaction, the amount paid, and the transaction number, which are elements that help establish proof of payment. Therefore, this commenter argued that the rule should permit the combined disclosure to be provided after payment, if a pre-payment disclosure is provided orally or on a screen at the point-of-sale. This commenter maintained that allowing oral or electronic disclosures would be appropriate in the context of EFTA section 919(a)(5) authority to permit combined disclosures and in light of the Bureau's duty to consider the final rule's costs and benefits. At minimum, this commenter believed the Bureau should permit this method of disclosure for senders who have used the provider's service in the past.",
                                "Another industry commenter stated that it currently only had the capability of providing information to senders on a register receipt after payment. This commenter believed that requiring a combined disclosure to be provided prior to payment would require printing a pre-payment disclosure in the middle of a sales transaction.",
                                "The Bureau recognizes the operational challenges associated with providing pre-payment and particularly combined disclosures to senders prior to payment. However, although current practice generally is to provide written disclosures after payment is made, the statute clearly requires certain disclosures to be provided prior to payment and other disclosures to be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that the statute precludes combined disclosures from being provided to senders after payment or in a non-written format. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) affirmatively requires that the combined disclosure be accurate at the time at which payment is made (emphasis added). Such a requirement would be superfluous if the combined disclosure could be provided after payment because a disclosure provided after payment must accurately reflect the terms of the completed transaction pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau believes the statute requires both the pre-payment disclosure and the combined disclosure be given prior to payment.",
                                "As discussed below in \u00a7 1005.36, special timing rules have been adopted for preauthorized remittance transfers to account for the particular challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that may occur far in the future. Therefore, proposed \u00a7 205.31(e)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.31(e)(1), with modifications to reference new \u00a7 1005.36. Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), a pre-payment disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer.",

The proposed comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with a reference to the provisions for preauthorized remittance transfers in new \u00a7 1005.36. Comment 31(e)-1 states that, except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. The comment clarifies that whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and that provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. For example, a sender who asks the provider to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In contrast, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer."

Proposed \u00a7 205.31(e)(2) provided that a receipt must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on this proposed provision. Under the final rule, a receipt required to be provided by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) generally must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer, except for preauthorized remittance transfers as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a). The Bureau notes that the final rule does not require the receipt to be provided at an exact moment when the sender, for example, hands cash or a credit card to an agent to pay for the transfer. Rather, the Bureau believes that payment for a remittance transfer is a process that may involve several steps. For example, payment for a transfer by credit card could involve a sender handing a credit card to an agent, the agent asking the sender for identification, the agent sending the credit card authorization request, the card authorization being approved, the agent requesting signature on a credit card receipt, and the sender signing the credit card receipt.",

Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule, however, adds a reference to the special timing rules for preauthorized remittance transfers in \u00a7 1005.36. The comment also adds a clarification regarding when a payment is made for purposes of the final rule, including an example stating that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes a payment. The Bureau believes that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes payment because a receipt will be most useful to a sender at that time. Otherwise, if payment is considered to be made when the funds actually leave the sender's account due to delays in processing a payment, a receipt may not be provided to a sender for a day or more. Furthermore, it is not clear how a sender's cancellation right would operate in this scenario. For example, because a sender does not know when funds leave an account, a sender would be unable to know when the cancellation right would be triggered.",
                                "Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(a), a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer in person, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.",
                                "Proposed \u00a7 205.31(e)(2) further stated that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone, a written receipt may be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which payment is made for the remittance transfer. If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the written receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement. See EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B). In some circumstances, a provider conducting such a transfer from the sender's account held by the provider is not required to provide a periodic statement under other laws. The Board believed that in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to permit the provider to provide a written receipt within a similar period of time as a periodic statement. Therefore, pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Board also proposed in \u00a7 205.31(e)(2) that the written receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not required. Under the proposal, in order for the written receipt to be mailed or delivered to a sender conducting a transaction entirely by telephone at these later times, the remittance transfer provider was required to comply with the foreign language requirements of proposed \u00a7 205.31(g)(3).",
                                "One industry commenter argued that the Bureau should include a timing exception in circumstances where a receipt is required to be provided to a sender shortly before a periodic statement is produced. This commenter stated that a remittance transfer provider may not be able to provide the required disclosures to a sender for a remittance transfer that occurs at the end of a billing cycle in time to include in the statement. The commenter suggested that in such circumstances, the Bureau should permit the receipt to be provided by the later of the next periodic statement date or 30 days after payment. The Bureau believes the final rule gives providers sufficient time to provide a receipt to a sender after a remittance transfer is sent; thus, no accommodation for transfers made at the end of a billing cycle is included in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2). Because periodic statements must include certain information that occurs during a cycle, see \u00a7 1005.9(b), the Bureau expects that, for purposes unrelated to this rule, providers already delay sending a periodic statement for a short time after a cycle ends to ensure that all activity occurring within a cycle is included in the appropriate statement.",
                                "Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt the provisions regarding mailing a receipt in proposed \u00a7 205.31(e)(2) as \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) with revisions. Section 1005.31(e)(2) in the final rule eliminates the requirement to comply with proposed \u00a7 205.31(g)(3), because the provision has been eliminated in the final rule, as discussed in further detail below. Section 1005.31(e)(2) is also revised to state that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided, rather than if a periodic statement is not required. In some circumstances, a provider may provide a sender with a periodic statement even if one is not required to be provided. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes a provider should instead disclose the receipt on or with the periodic statement and that the provision allowing a provider to give a receipt 30 days after payment is made should not apply.",
                                "Section 1005.31(e)(2) is further revised to account for circumstances in which a provider discloses the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), in order to use the telephone exceptions pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). In those circumstances, the Bureau does not believe a provider should be required to repeat the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation on a receipt when it has already been disclosed to the sender. Thus, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) states that the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The Bureau also adds comment 31(e)(2)-5 to clarify that even though the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation need not be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2), the statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).",
                                "Proposed comment 31(e)-3 provided further clarification regarding circumstances where a sender transfers funds from his or her account, as defined by \u00a7 205.2(b) (currently \u00a7 1005.2(b)), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 31(e)-3, which is adopted substantially as proposed.",
                                "The Bureau is providing further guidance in the final rule regarding the timing of receipts for remittance transfers made via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message are conducted entirely by mobile telephone, the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for such transfers. Similarly, the Bureau believes that that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B) permits receipts for transfers sent entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message to be provided in accordance with the mailing rules provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) or \u00a7 1005.36(a). Therefore, the final rule adds a new comment 31(e)-4 to clarify that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) or \u00a7 1005.36(a). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) or \u00a7 1005.36(a).",

The Bureau notes that written receipts provided in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2) or \u00a7 1005.36(a) may be provided electronically, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.

However, if any of the disclosures required by proposed \u00a7 205.31(b) are not accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, a provider would be required to give new disclosures before receiving payment for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender at a retail store may be provided a pre-payment disclosure under proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(1) at a customer service desk, but the sender may decide to leave the desk to go shopping.

The statute and the implementing regulation seek to ensure that if remittance transfer providers make a concerted effort to reach out to potential remittance transfer customers through advertisements, solicitations, and marketing in a foreign language in a particular office, then such providers should also be required to provide important disclosures in that language when such customers come to that office to purchase remittance transfer services from that provider or assert an error.",

Under proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1, factors contributing to whether a foreign language is principally used would include: (i) The frequency with which the remittance transfer provider advertises, solicits, or markets remittance transfers in a foreign language at a particular office; (ii) the prominence of such advertising, soliciting, or marketing in that language at that office; and (iii) the specific foreign language terms used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at that office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 also included examples to illustrate when a foreign language is principally used and when there is incidental use of the language. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board also considered an objective standard based on whether a foreign language meets a certain percentage threshold of a remittance transfer provider's advertisements at a particular office. However, the Board rejected such a standard based on the fact that the standard may be arbitrary, may be difficult to administer, and may inappropriately exclude instances where a foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit or market remittance transfers, even if the number of advertisements in the foreign language is nominally low.",
                                        "Some industry commenters suggested that there be further clarification on the term \u201cprincipally used,\u201d but did not specifically state what kind of guidance would be helpful. A consumer group commenter agreed with the proposed facts-and-circumstances approach for determining foreign languages principally used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing remittance transfer services. A member of Congress agreed with the Board's interpretation that the statutory provision contemplated that more than one foreign language could be principally used.",
                                        "The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing comment 31(g)(1)-1. Because the Bureau believes the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the use of a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers will determine whether a foreign language is \u201cprincipally used\u201d to advertise, solicit, or market at a particular office, the Bureau does not believe further general statements would be helpful. However, the Bureau is amending one of the illustrative examples in comment 31(g)(1)-1 to provide a more clear example of when a remittance transfer provider would be considered to be principally using a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office."

The Board further noted that a telephone number or Web site that provides general information about the remittance transfer provider, but through which a consumer does not have the ability to complete a transaction or assert an error, is not an office.

Consequently, if the remittance transfer provider conducted the actual transaction or communicated with the sender regarding the alleged error in a foreign language, a remittance transfer provider could then switch to English to orally disclose the required information under such a rule. The Bureau believes that senders would benefit from having the required oral disclosures provided in the same language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert the error, regardless of whether the language meets the foreign language advertising trigger. Failure to include this modification from the general foreign language requirement for oral disclosures could lead to consumers not understanding the required disclosures, which would be contrary to the goals and purposes of the statute.",

Otherwise, under EFTA section 919(b), a sender conducting a telephone transaction orally or receiving the results of an error investigation orally could be given disclosures in English and in every foreign language triggered by the regulation, which would likely lead to consumer confusion. While the Bureau recognizes that this rule might reduce the languages in which a remittance transfer provider would be willing to conduct a transaction, the Bureau believes that applying the general foreign language disclosure rule to oral disclosures would be harmful to consumers for the reasons set forth above.",

Although some senders may not have enough familiarity with English to feel comfortable speaking with the remittance transfer provider in English, the same pressure to comprehend and respond quickly does not exist with written disclosures. Unlike with oral disclosures, senders have sufficient time to review written disclosures and, if necessary, find resources to help understand the disclosure.",

The Bureau also notes that a remittance transfer provider may have employees or agents that happen to speak a certain foreign language for which the provider does not have written disclosures. The Bureau would not want providers to discourage such employees or agents from using their foreign language skills to help senders with their remittance transfer transactions in order to avoid having to provide written disclosures in the language spoken by the employee or agent. In order to minimize the potential unintended consequence of having remittance transfer providers reduce the number of foreign languages they may offer for telephone transactions, the Bureau is not adopting proposed \u00a7 205.31(g)(3). Therefore, written receipts required to be provided to the sender after payment for transactions conducted entirely by telephone are subject to the general rule under \u00a7 1005.31(g)(1)."

EFTA section 919(b) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single disclosure.

Since the proposed commentary was not a strict limit, the Board solicited comment on whether the regulation should strictly limit the number of languages that may be contained in a single written or electronic disclosure. The Board also sought comment on whether three languages is an appropriate suggested limit to the number of languages in a single written or electronic document.",

A consumer group commenter recommended that rather than adopting a ceiling on the number of languages that may appear on a disclosure, the Bureau should create guidelines that ensure disclosures with multiple foreign languages are easy to understand.",

In the Bureau's view, if a remittance transfer provider principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office, the remittance transfer provider is deliberately reaching out to consumers speaking that foreign language, and the required disclosures should be provided in that foreign language, regardless of whether it is a language that is commonly used for remittance transfers originating in the United States. Furthermore, while too many languages on a single written document may diminish a consumer's ability to read and understand the disclosures, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers may find ways to present the information in a number of foreign languages that are clear and conspicuous to senders, and that imposing a definitive limit on the number of languages that may appear on a single disclosure may be too inflexible. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the formatting requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(c), as discussed above, may help to ensure that senders can find and understand the information that is most important to them with respect to the remittance transfer. The Bureau is amending comment 31(g)-1 to note that disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(1) without suggesting a specific limit on the number of languages in a single disclosure.",
                                        "Proposed comment 31(g)-1 also clarified that the remittance transfer provider may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The Board also proposed several examples in comment 31(g)-1 to illustrate the application of this concept.",

The Bureau notes that EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market at that office. This means that regardless of which office a sender chooses to conduct a remittance transfer, he or she will always obtain written or electronic disclosures in English, even if the disclosure in a foreign language is not consistent among different offices because such disclosure will depend on whether the foreign language meets the foreign language disclosure trigger at that office. The Bureau believes that always disclosing in English is important to allow senders to compare disclosures received at different provider locations and for different providers. Therefore, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures in English in all cases. This is fully consistent with EFTA section 919(b). Comment 31(g)-1 is adopted as proposed with some technical and clarifying amendments, including to remove references to \u00a7 205.31(g)(3), consistent with the Bureau's decision regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, as discussed above.",

                                        "EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts. The provision states that such a notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) also states that the Bureau may require the notice prescribed to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider. Further, EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the internet to provide a notice, comparable to the storefront notice described in the statute, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.",
                                        "EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B) states that, prior to proposing rules under EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A), appropriate studies and analyses must be performed to determine whether a storefront notice or internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer to: (i) Compare prices for remittance transfers, and (ii) understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The studies and analyses must be consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), which requires an economic impact analysis that considers the costs and benefits of a regulation to financial institutions, consumers, and other users. These costs and benefits include the extent to which additional paperwork would be required, the effects upon competition in the provision of services among large and small financial institutions, and the availability of services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers.",
                                        "Consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B), the Board reviewed and analyzed the statute and a variety of independent articles, studies, and Congressional testimony; conducted outreach with industry and consumer advocates; and held focus groups with consumers who send remittance transfers. Based on its findings, summarized below, the Board concluded in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that the statutory notice would not facilitate a consumer's ability to compare prices or to understand the fees and costs imposed on remittance transfers.",
                                        "The notice described by the statute illustrates only the exchange rate offered by that remittance transfer provider for the particular model transfer amount. In addition to the exchange rate, however, the total cost of a remittance transfer includes fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, any intermediary in the transfer, and the receiving entity. The total cost also includes any taxes that may be charged in the sending and receiving jurisdictions. Thus, the Board determined the statutory storefront notice would not present a complete picture to the consumer of all potential fees and costs for a remittance transfer.",
                                        "In the proposal, the Board considered two alternatives to the type of notice described in the statute that could more effectively communicate costs to a sender. The Board considered requiring the posting of transfer fee information for model send amounts, but believed that this alternative notice would have many of the same limitations as the statutory notice. The Board also considered requiring a notice that would reflect all the costs of a transfer. A notice with this alternative content could help consumers to obtain a better understanding of the total cost of a remittance transfer, but the length and complexity of such notices could limit their utility.",
                                        "The analysis conducted by the Board identified other limitations with both the statutory and alternative storefront disclosures. First, most consumers would be unable to apply the information provided by the statutory notice to their own transfers. The fees, exchange rate, and taxes for a remittance transfer can vary based upon the amount sent, transfer corridor (i.e., the sending location to the receiving location), speed of transfer (e.g., the next day, the same day, or in one hour), method of delivery (e.g., an electronic deposit into a bank account or a cash disbursement), and type of receiving entity (e.g., a bank or a money transmitter's payout partner). For example, some remittance transfer providers offer a discount on their exchange rate spread for large send amounts. Therefore, even if the consumer's transfer were identical to the model transfer posted in the storefront notice except for the send amount, the consumer still may be unable to determine the exchange rate that would apply to the consumer's transfer based on the storefront notice.",
                                        "Moreover, a consumer could be overwhelmed by the amount of data appearing in a long, complex storefront notice posted by these providers and, therefore, might not use it. A storefront notice for sending a specified amount to a single country could contain multiple rows of information to account for differences in pricing based on the transfer method, timing option, receipt location, and cost permutations described above. Many providers offer remittance transfers to multiple countries, and several locations within each country, which would multiply the number of data points on the notice.",
                                        "Finally, frequent fluctuations in exchange rates could result in disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time. Remittance transfer providers would have to update the storefront notice for each send location several times a week, or as frequently as several times a day, to account for the fluctuations in exchange rates. These rates could also be different at a single provider's different send locations. Remittance transfer providers would need to distribute the updated notices to each send location, and each send location would need to replace the outdated notice just as frequently. Non-exclusive send locations that offer the services of two or more money transmitters would have to post and update the storefront notices for each remittance transfer provider. As a result, a storefront notice could be unhelpful and even misleading to consumers, while creating unnecessary legal risks for remittance transfer providers.",
                                        "The analysis also identified potential effects that the storefront notice requirement would have on competition and costs to the consumer. The work involved in posting and updating storefront notices could cause some agents to stop offering remittance transfers. Further, credit unions and small banks that infrequently conduct transfers could find the burden and cost of producing storefront notices prohibitive and discontinue the service. Given the costs and risks associated with posting and updating the storefront notices contemplated by the statute, some providers could decide to exit the market, which could reduce competition among providers and increase costs for consumers.",
                                        "Because the Board did not propose a rule mandating the posting of storefront notices, it did not propose a rule mandating the posting of internet notices. Since the proposal did not require a storefront notice, there could be no \u201ccomparable\u201d internet notice. Moreover, the Board's study of model internet notices indicated that consumers using internet remittance transfer providers to request remittance transfers would be less likely to use a model transfer notice than those using providers at a physical location. Many internet providers currently disclose transaction-specific information prior to the consumer's payment for a transfer, and \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1), discussed above, makes this practice a regulatory requirement.",
                                        "Industry commenters supported the findings that the storefront notice and internet notice would not be useful to consumers. One consumer group commenter believed that the Bureau should require any storefront advertising to be in a storefront disclosure format prescribed by the Bureau. The commenter argued that the storefront disclosure should include the amount a sender pays to a remittance transfer provider and the amount to be received by a recipient for at least two sample amounts. The commenter suggested that disclosures could be based on the cost at a certain time, such as the previous business day, to alleviate the concerns about disclosures needing to be updated more frequently.",
                                        "The Bureau agrees with the Board's analysis, and believes that the storefront and internet disclosures described in EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) would not accomplish the statutory goals of facilitating the ability of consumers to compare prices for remittance transfers and to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The disclosures would not provide a complete disclosure of all of the costs of a remittance transfer. Even if all costs were provided in the disclosures, consumers would be unable to extrapolate from a storefront disclosure the cost of their particular transaction, because the cost could depend on other variables. The Bureau also recognizes the burden on remittance transfer providers could be significant and could lead some providers to no longer provide remittance services. The burden on providers would be substantial even if the disclosures were only required to be updated daily. Moreover, requiring less frequent updating would result in the disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time.",
                                        "Because the cost to providers could be substantial, and the benefit of the storefront and internet disclosures would be minimal, the final rule does not require the posting of model remittance transfer notices at a storefront or on the internet."

                "The statute provides two exceptions to the requirement to disclose the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The first exception is in EFTA section 919(a)(4). It provides that, subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received. Under the statute, a remittance transfer provider may use this exception only if: (i) It is an insured depository institution or insured credit union (collectively, an \u201cinsured institution\u201d as described in more detail below) conducting a transfer from an account that the sender holds with it; and (ii) the insured institution is unable to know, for reasons beyond its control, the amount of currency that will be made available to the designated recipient. See EFTA section 919(a)(4). This exception (the \u201ctemporary exception\u201d) expires five years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 21, 2015. If the Bureau determines that expiration of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries, the Bureau may extend the exception to not longer than ten years after enactment (i.e., to July 21, 2020). See EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B).",
                "The second exception is in EFTA section 919(c). It provides that if the Bureau determines that a recipient country does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, the Bureau may prescribe rules addressing the issue. EFTA section 919(c) further states that if rules are prescribed, they must include standards for the remittance transfer provider to provide: (i) A receipt that is consistent with EFTA sections 919(a) and (b); and (ii) a reasonably accurate estimate of the currency to be received. The second exception (the \u201cpermanent exception\u201d) does not have a sunset date.",

Proposed \u00a7 205.32 generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to disclose estimates if it cannot determine exact amounts for the reasons specified in the statute. The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 205.32 generally as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.32, with clarifications and revisions in response to comments received, as discussed in detail below. In addition, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32-1 to provide additional guidance on the circumstances when estimates may be provided. Specifically, new comment 32-1 states that estimates as permitted in \u00a7 1005.32(a) and (b) may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in \u00a7 1005.36(a)(1) and (2)."

For example, one commenter stated that restricting the use of estimates could discourage innovation and increase costs to offset risk. Consumer group commenters generally supported the proposed use of estimates but requested that the temporary exception not be extended. Some industry commenters, however, objected to permitting estimates to be disclosed because estimates could lead to inaccurate or misleading disclosures which would disservice consumers.",
                        "The Bureau believes permitting estimates, as provided by the temporary exception, is consistent with the statutory language and purpose of EFTA section 919(a)(4). The statute specifically provides that, subject to the Bureau's rules, an insured institution may use a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency received under certain circumstances. Section 1005.32(a)(1) implements the temporary exception generally as proposed, as discussed below.",
                        "EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. Nonetheless, proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)(1) also permitted disclosure of an estimate for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, the fees imposed by intermediaries in the transmittal route, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient to the extent those amounts are not known for reasons beyond the insured institution's control. In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board stated its belief that, by permitting an estimate of the amount that will be received, Congress must have intended to permit estimates of the components that determine that amount. The inability to determine the exact amount of one or more of these additional items is the reason why the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient must be estimated. Furthermore, the Board stated that permitting estimates of these additional items would help consumers to understand why the amount of currency to be received is displayed as an estimate. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau concurs with the Board's reasoning, and believes that to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the exchange rate, transfer amount, and other fees and taxes disclosures in \u00a7 1005.32(a)(1). To not exercise the Bureau's authority in this way would render the statutory exemption essentially meaningless, and the Bureau believes that result could not be intended by the statutory exemption for estimating the amount of currency received.",
                        "In the proposed rule, the Board also stated that EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses the use of an estimate of the amount of foreign currency that will be received by a designated recipient. However, the proposed rule permitted an estimate of the currency that will be received, whether it is in U.S. dollars or foreign currency. The Bureau understands that senders may send remittance transfers to be paid to the designated recipient in U.S. dollars. When an insured institution sends a remittance transfer via international wire transfer, fees are sometimes deducted by intermediary institutions in the transmittal route with which the sending institution has no correspondent relationship. Although the insured institution may not know the total amount of these fees in advance, it must disclose them to the sender under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The amount that will be received by the designated recipient, whether that currency is U.S. dollars or foreign currency, will be an estimate if fees imposed by intermediaries are disclosed as estimates. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the amount of currency that will be received, even if that currency is in U.S. dollars.",
                        "The proposed commentary to \u00a7 205.32(a)(1) provided further guidance on the temporary exception. Specifically, proposed comment 32(a)(1)-1 clarified that an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts \u201cfor reasons beyond its control\u201d when: (i) The exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(1)(iv) is set by a person with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship after the insured institution sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) fees required to be disclosed under proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(1)(vi) are imposed by intermediary institutions along the transmittal route and the insured institution has no correspondent relationship with those institutions.",
                        "One industry commenter requested clarification regarding instances when an insured institution has a correspondent relationship but may not control or know what exchange rate the correspondent will use. For example, a remittance transfer provider may send a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and a correspondent institution may be responsible for exchanging to the currency in which funds will be received. Similarly, other industry commenters noted that an insured institution may not know the taxes or fees imposed by a correspondent institution. Although the Bureau acknowledges that some insured institutions currently may not receive certain exchange rate, tax, or fee information from a correspondent institution, the Bureau believes that such information can be obtained through contractual arrangements in a correspondent relationship. The Bureau notes that the statutory exception is only available for circumstances beyond remittance transfer providers' control, and the Bureau believes that adjusting contractual arrangements with correspondent banks to provide for better information relay is within the control of remittance transfer providers. Accordingly, comment 32(a)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions and an example.",
                        "Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-2 provided examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the examples provided in the proposed comment. Comment 32(a)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.i. clarifies that an insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.ii. provides that an insured institution cannot determine the exact fees to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution, with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-2.iii. states that an insured institution cannot determine the exact taxes to disclose under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the insured institution cannot determine the applicable exchange rate or other fees, as described in proposed comments 32(a)(1)-2.i. and 32(a)(1)-2.ii., and the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees.",

In each case, the insured institution could determine the exact amount for the relevant disclosure. The proposed examples illustrated that if an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate, fees, and taxes required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and (vi), it can determine the exact amounts to be derived from calculations involving them.",
                        "The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed provision, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.i. explains that an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.ii. states that an insured institution can determine the exact fees required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has negotiated specific fees with a correspondent institution, and the correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution, which itself does not impose fees. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-3.iii. clarifies that an insured institution can determine the exact taxes required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees, and the insured institution can determine the exact amount of the applicable exchange rate and other fees. Similarly, the insured institution can determine these taxes if the recipient country imposes a specific sum tax that is not tied to the amount transferred.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)(2) provided that the temporary exception expires on July 20, 2015, consistent with the five-year term set forth in EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B). EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B) gives the Bureau authority to extend the application of the temporary exception to July 21, 2020, if it determines that termination of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries. The Bureau understands that this exception was intended to avoid an immediate disruption of remittance transfer services by insured institutions using international wire transfers. The exception gives these institutions time to reach agreements and modify systems to provide accurate disclosures.",
                        "Industry commenters argued that the temporary exception for insured institutions should be made permanent, or in the alternative, be extended to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is July 21, 2020. The OCC also noted the ability of the Bureau to extend the temporary exception for insured institutions to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and urged the Bureau to consider the impact of these standards on community banks. In contrast, consumer groups supported the five-year sunset of the temporary exception and requested that the Bureau indicate that the temporary exception will not be extended.",
                        "The Bureau notes that the sunset of the temporary exception is statutory. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is no basis at this time to assess whether allowing the exception to expire in accordance with the statute would have negative effects where the final rule is just now being issued, initial implementation is expected to take a year, and the market has not yet had a chance to respond to the regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Bureau declines to extend the temporary exception at this time. Finally, the Bureau notes that in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)(2) stated July 20, 2015 as the sunset date for the temporary exception provided in \u00a7 205.32(a)(1). The final rule includes a technical edit to clarify that the sunset date for the temporary exception is July 21, 2015 in order to avoid potential confusion and promote consistency among references to the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.32(a)(2), with a technical edit to reflect the change in date to July 21, 2015.",

Industry commenters generally requested clarification on the application of the temporary exception to uninsured institutions. In particular, these commenters requested that the temporary exception should also include uninsured depository institutions, such as certain U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. They also argued that uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks also process retail international wire transfers in the same manner as insured institutions, and would face similar compliance challenges as other insured institutions.",
                        "The Bureau believes that including uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks in the term \u201cinsured institution\u201d is consistent with the purposes of the statutory exception and will prevent disruption in remittance transfer services. The Bureau notes that section 3(c)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that for certain purposes, the term \u201cinsured depository institution\u201d includes any uninsured U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank or a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank. Therefore, the Bureau believes including uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the term \u201cinsured institution\u201d is consistent with the statutory exception and section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)(3) is adopted with clarification in renumbered \u00a7 1005.32(a)(3).",

However, as discussed above, the Bureau is clarifying that, for the purposes of this rule, fund transfers in connection with securities transactions are not remittance transfers. Therefore, the Bureau believes further clarification in the rule with respect to this comment is not necessary."

Like the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4), the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. For the reasons described above with respect to the temporary exception, proposed \u00a7 205.32(b) also permitted disclosure of estimates for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. For the reasons set forth above with regard to the temporary exception and to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt this proposed permanent exception in \u00a7 1005.32(b)."

Specifically, the Board interpreted the exception under \u00a7 205.32(b)(2) to apply to remittances sent via international ACH on terms negotiated by the government of the United States and the government of a recipient country where the exchange rate is set after the transfer is sent. Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 stated that the \u201cmethod by which transactions are made in the recipient country\u201d does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank after the provider sends the remittance transfer.",

These commenters argued that international wire transfers are a method by which transactions are made in a recipient country that does not allow the remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient and should thus qualify for the permanent exception. One industry commenter stated that the permanent exception is helpful for certain international ACH transactions; however, the benefit is limited by the number of recipient countries that participate in the Federal Reserve System's FedGlobal ACH program. Other industry commenters requested that all international ACH transfers be covered by the permanent exception and that the exception should not be limited to those that are sent on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government. These commenters noted that all cross-border ACH transfers, regardless of how the exchange rate is set, are subject to similar difficulties as certain international ACH transfers that qualify for the permanent exception. Consumer group commenters supported the proposal's application of the permanent exception based on the method to certain international ACH transfers.",
                                "In each case, the Bureau agrees with the Board's interpretation. The Bureau believes that extending the permanent exception to international wire transfers and all international ACH transactions would be inconsistent with the statutory language and purpose of the provision, which specifically refers to methods of transfer in a recipient country (emphasis added). The Bureau must give meaning to this phrase, and does not believe that the interpretation urged by commenters is dependent on a method of transfer in a particular country.",
                                "The Bureau does not believe that the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) applies to international wire transfers because wire transfers are not a method that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Rather, compliance challenges may arise due to the international wire transfer business model, which is based on a chain of correspondents and two-party contractual relationships.",
                                "In addition, the application of the permanent exception to international wire transfers and ACH transactions generally would make the temporary exception superfluous. As discussed above, the statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers, and therefore, covers open network transactions. Further, as described above with regard to the temporary exception, the statute specifically permits the use of estimates by depository institutions and credit unions for certain account-based transactions. If all open network transactions were included in the permanent exception, there would be no need for the temporary exception because nearly all, if not all, the types of transfers that qualify for the temporary exception would be covered by the permanent exception. The Bureau does not believe the temporary exception is superfluous. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the permanent exception to these transactions.",
                                "One commenter argued that the permanent exception for method of transfer should also include instances when the remittance transfer provider and the sender agree to have the exchange rate set at some point in the future (i.e., floating rate products). As with wire transfers, such an agreement is not a method by which a transaction is made that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Therefore, the Bureau also believes that this circumstance would not be eligible for the permanent exception. The Bureau notes, however, that the remittance transfer provider that is party to such an agreement may provide estimates of the exchange rate if the remittance transfer provider qualifies for the temporary exception in \u00a7 1005.32(a). For the reasons discussed above, proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(ii).

The Bureau notes that some comments received indicate that there may be confusion as to the application of the permanent exception provided in \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) to any transfer sent via international ACH. However, comment 32(b)-4.i. explains that a transfer would only qualify for the exception when sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, the provider cannot determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv).

In this case, transactions are made using a method negotiated between the United States and a private entity. Nonetheless, remittance transfers sent using such a method may qualify for the temporary exception in \u00a7 1005.32(a).

Thus, use of an approach other than one listed in the proposed rule is compliant with the regulation if the sender is not harmed by such use.",
                        "Industry commenters generally requested greater flexibility in estimating exchange rates and fees. For example, commenters recommended less prescriptive approaches, such as permitting remittance transfer providers to base estimates on reasonably available information, adopting a reasonably accurate standard, or adopting a safe harbor for good faith estimates within a specified tolerance. The Bureau generally concurs with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that providing a list of approaches for calculating estimates would be more helpful to remittance transfer providers and consumers than a less specific standard for calculating estimates. The Bureau believes that requiring estimates be provided based on an approach listed in the regulation will facilitate compliance with the final rule. However, in response to comments received, the Bureau is clarifying proposed \u00a7 205.32(c). The safe harbor in proposed \u00a7 205.32(c) was intended to provide greater flexibility and to facilitate compliance for remittance transfer providers that may base an estimate on an approach that is not listed in the rule. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposal, the provider would have been required to compare any estimate based on its own approach with an estimate based on a listed approach in order to determine whether the sender would be harmed by such use. The Bureau believes that this comparison would unnecessarily increase the burden of using an unlisted approach and render the safe harbor meaningless. Therefore, the Bureau revises proposed \u00a7 205.32(c) to state that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach not listed in the rule, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the rule so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed as required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that this clarification also ensures that the sender is not harmed because the amount of funds received by the designated recipient will be the same or greater than the estimated total amount received as required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 205.32(c) as \u00a7 1005.32(c) with amendment."

Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 clarified that if the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(2) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer will be the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, i.e., the current business day's exchange rate.

Industry commenters argued that the wholesale interbank exchange rate would not be the rate actually applied to a consumer's remittance transfer, so using the wholesale exchange rate as an estimate would be misleading to consumers. For instance, basing an estimate on only the wholesale rate could consistently overestimate the amount of currency received by a recipient because the wholesale rate does not account for any spread applied to the rate for a sender's remittance transfer to a particular country. One commenter noted that estimates of exchange rates may be based on information from foreign exchange dealers as well as rates available in the marketplace.",

Specifically, \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) provides that, in disclosing the exchange rate as required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), an estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale rate and, if applicable, the spread typically applied to such a rate by the remittance transfer provider or its correspondent to the wholesale rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency.

If a remittance transfer provider uses the most recent wholesale exchange rate as a basis for an estimate of an exchange rate, the exchange rate estimate must also reflect any spread that is typically applied to such a rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. For example, assume a remittance transfer provider (or its correspondent) typically applies a spread, such as a fixed percentage, to a wholesale rate in order to determine the exchange rate offered to a sender for remittance transfers for a particular currency. If the provider must estimate an exchange rate for another remittance transfer for the same currency, the remittance transfer provider must estimate the exchange rate by applying the same spread (i.e., fixed percentage) to the most recent publicly available wholesale rate.",

The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. One industry commenter, however, noted that for currency exchange rates not listed by a U.S. news service, remittance transfer providers could rely on the basis for estimates provided under proposed \u00a7 205.32(c)(1)(iii).

Based on these comments, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32(c)(1)-4 to provide guidance when an exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times within a day. Specifically, comment 32(c)(1)-4 clarifies that if the exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day for the purposes of determining the \u201cmost recent\u201d exchange rate.",

However, in some instances the exchange rate used for a transfer may be set by other institutions, such as a foreign ACH counterpart or an intermediary institution in a transmittal route that is not a correspondent institution. For example, the first intermediary institution in the transmittal route that is in the recipient country may set the exchange rate and conduct the currency exchange before transmitting the remittance transfer to the recipient institution, which then makes the funds available to the designated recipient. Therefore, upon further consideration, proposed \u00a7 205.32(c)(1)(iii), in renumbered \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), is revised to state that an estimate may be also based on the most recent exchange rate offered or used by the person in the transmittal route setting the exchange rate. The Bureau notes that \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), as revised, addresses circumstances in which the local currency is infrequently traded or when wholesale exchange rates would not have been publicly available."

Another commenter suggested that some small insured institutions may be unaware of the number of intermediary institutions involved in the transmittal route. Commenters also argued that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient information to be able to disclose any estimates, and that the requirement would impose operational burden on insured institutions, particularly on insured institutions that do not send international wire transfers frequently or are unable to obtain representations of intermediary institutions.",

The Bureau further believes that the rule provides sufficient flexibility to facilitate compliance and that representative transmittal routes are readily determinable. In addition, the Bureau notes that a remittance transfer provider may be required to estimate other fees as required by \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1)(vi) in other circumstances. For example, if a remittance transfer provider estimates the exchange rate under the \u00a7 1005.32(b) permanent exception, a provider may be required to estimate other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarification. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a new \u00a7 1005.32(c)(3)(i) to provide that for other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with \u00a7 1005.32(c)(1), prior to any rounding of the estimated exchange rate.

Some of these commenters suggested that requiring providers to assume responsibility for errors when the provider has not erred nor controlled the circumstances that caused the error would undermine the safety and soundness of these transfer systems and could lead some financial institutions to eliminate remittance transfer services. Other industry commenters predicted that the financial impact of losses experienced as a result of errors caused by another party could be significant enough for providers to exit the market.",
                                "The Bureau is amending certain error definitions in response to these comments, as discussed below. In general, under a number of financial consumer protection laws, the regulated entity has the responsibility to investigate errors asserted by consumers and generally assumes much of the liability when an error has occurred even where neither the regulated entity nor the consumer are at fault. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1693f and 1693g; 15 U.S.C. 1643; 12 CFR 1005.11; and 12 CFR 1026.13. Thus, consistent with other error resolution procedures in Federal financial consumer protection laws, the Bureau believes that where neither a sender nor a remittance transfer provider are necessarily at fault, a provider generally is in a better position than a sender to identify, and possibly recover from, the party at fault.",
                                "Furthermore, placing liability with the remittance transfer provider in these instances aligns the remittance transfer provider's incentives with those of the sender. Remittance transfer providers are likely better able to work with parties in the remittance transfer system or government entities to reduce errors to remittance transfers overall. Placing responsibility on providers increases the incentives of providers to develop such policies, procedures, and controls. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. The Bureau further notes that this is similar to the approach taken in defining \u201cerrors\u201d under \u00a7 1005.11 for EFTs where something may be considered an \u201cerror\u201d even if the financial institution did not cause the error."

The Bureau notes, however, that none of the other errors in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1) rely on the difference between what may be disclosed as an estimate and the actual amount. For example, suppose a remittance transfer is permitted to estimate disclosures under \u00a7 1005.32. If the remittance transfer provider fails to deliver any funds to the designated recipient, the sender should be able to assert an error even though the provider disclosed an estimate. As a result, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32 is adopted as renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A).",

This clarification prevents a remittance transfer provider from relying on the exception for estimates if it makes available to the designated recipient an amount that is completely unrelated to the amount calculated using the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes. For example, if the remittance transfer provider estimated the amount to be received pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32 as 1,200 pesos in the receipt or combined disclosure, and the amount calculated using the applicable actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes is 1,150 pesos, the provider cannot use the \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) exception to claim that there is no error if it made only 100 pesos available to the designated recipient.",

The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to provide this exception for an error involving an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient. For example, suppose a foreign government in the country where a remittance transfer is to be delivered imposes an emergency tax on the transfer that was not in effect nor could have been reasonably anticipated at the time the provider was required to give the sender the receipt or combined disclosure. The failure to make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, which did not reflect the emergency tax, should not constitute an error if the designated recipient received the disclosed amount of currency less the emergency tax.",
                                "As a result, new \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) provides that the failure to make the amount of currency stated in the receipt or combined disclosure is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Furthermore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(a)-4 to provide guidance on what types of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated qualify for the exception. The comment is similar to the comment adopted as comment 33(a)-6 below, which describes extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated for purposes of the error for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).",
                                "Proposed comment 33(a)-2 is adopted with a change to clarify that if a provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, and the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. The change is intended to be consistent with the Bureau's general approach to rounding exchange rates as described above in the supplementary information to comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2.

                                "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv) generally defined an \u201cerror\u201d to include a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33(a)-4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv). These circumstances included: (i) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non-delivery of the transfer; (ii) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account; (iii) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient; and (iv) the fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the provider's agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient.",
                                "Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in \u201cfriendly fraud\u201d where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick-up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error.",
                                "One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer provider's control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures.",
                                "As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under \u00a7 1005.2(m), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means. See comment 2(m)-3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT (for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules (e.g., payment card network rules, ACH system rules). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity (e.g., a merchant) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient.",
                                "Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer provider's incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender.",
                                "One industry commenter suggested that a sender be required to inform the remittance transfer provider if the confirmation number or receipt is lost or stolen. For some remittance transfer providers, a designated recipient is required to give the confirmation number, which is generally printed on the receipt, in order to obtain access to the funds in a remittance transfer. The commenter suggested that this approach would be similar to the approach taken with respect to a lost or stolen access device in \u00a7 1005.6(b) with respect to unauthorized EFTs, where a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device to the account-holder financial institution.",
                                "The Bureau notes, however, the risk for a lost or stolen confirmation number is not the same as for a lost or stolen access device for EFTs. A lost or stolen access device could potentially be used to initiate an EFT by a person who is not the account holder immediately without an accomplice and without identification matching the name associated with the access device. By contrast, where a confirmation number given to the sender is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person who gains access to the number would not be able to take advantage of it unless he or she were located or had an accomplice in the recipient country. Furthermore, because access to funds sent by a remittance transfer provider is often limited to those with identification matching the designated recipient on the receipt, an unauthorized person who gains access to a lost or stolen confirmation number may be deterred from taking advantage of it. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on whether he or she reports a confirmation number or receipt as lost or stolen.",
                                "Moreover, under \u00a7 1005.6(b), a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device because the speed with which a consumer reports the lost or stolen access device may be critical to preventing further unauthorized EFTs and further losses, and the possibility of increased liability provides incentives for a consumer to report quickly. In contrast, a lost or stolen confirmation number would not result in losses other than the specific remittance transfer in question. Therefore, the Bureau also does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on how quickly a sender reports a lost or stolen confirmation number.",

The proposed comment also provided that the exception for circumstances beyond a provider's control covered government actions or other restrictions that occur after the transfer has been sent but that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or the garnishment or attachment of funds.",

Several industry commenters recommended that the exception should be more broadly interpreted to exclude errors caused by acts of a third party beyond a remittance transfer provider's control. Consumer group commenters believed the approach in the proposed rule was a reasonable limitation and recommended that the commentary specifically state that mistakes by a recipient institution do not fall under the exception to the error to deliver funds by the date of delivery. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the final rule limit the circumstances even further to only include acts of war or terrorism or natural disaster.",

Even if the error is caused by a third party beyond the remittance transfer provider's control, the Bureau believes that the remittance transfer provider is often in a better position to identify and recover the loss from the third party than a sender, especially when there are multiple intermediary institutions involved in a transfer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that with respect to third-party errors, the circumstances in proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) should include only a narrow category of third-party errors caused by uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer.",

Several industry commenters and the OCC noted that for fraud screening, BSA, or OFAC purposes, a remittance transfer provider may have further communications with the sender to ensure the legitimacy or the legality of a remittance transfer. This, in turn, may cause delays in making the funds available to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to exclude these situations from the definition of \u201cerror\u201d in order to encourage remittance transfer providers to continue to engage in activities that benefit the safety of the transfer system as a whole.

Therefore, the Bureau believes it is not necessary to state that an inquiry involving a transfer of $15 or less is not an error, and is not adopting proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(2)(i). A Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that for certain assertions of error that exceed the $15 threshold, providers may still not have the ability to investigate the assertion because they are less than the minimum amount traceable in a foreign country. In order to ensure that senders are protected with respect to errors related to remittance transfers other than truly de minimis amounts, however, the Bureau is not inclined to create another threshold amount above the $15 coverage threshold for which an inquiry is not an error. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(2)(ii) or (iii). These provisions are adopted as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.",

Comment 33(a)-7 clarifies new \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) by providing that the exception is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. The comment also includes an illustrative example. The example explains that if a sender requests a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.",

In such cases, the Bureau believes that this type of customer service should be preserved. The Bureau, however, is concerned that remittance transfer providers may try to provide the remittance transfer to the designated recipient in a different currency simply because the provider or its agent do not have sufficient amounts of the sender-requested currency on hand. Therefore, the Bureau believes that this exception should only be available if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change.",

Under one example, a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). Similarly, if the remittance transfer provider relies on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the change in the amount of currency the designated recipient actually receives due to the taxes actually imposed does not constitute an error pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iv)."

                                "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(b) set forth the timing and content requirements for a notice of error provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(1)(i) stated that a sender must provide a notice of error orally or in writing to the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the date of availability of the remittance transfer stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(1)(ii), such notice of error must enable the remittance transfer provider to identify: the sender's name and telephone number or address; the recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(1)(iii) stated that the notice must also indicate why the sender believes the error exists and include to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except in the case of requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(v).",
                                "Several industry commenters suggested that the time period for senders to assert an error is too long. Some industry commenters recommended that the time period be shortened to 60 days, similar to the time period that consumers have to assert errors for EFTs. See \u00a7 1005.11(b)(3). Other industry commenters suggested 30 days. The Bureau notes that the 180-day time period for senders to assert an error is expressly stated in the statute. Given the international nature of remittance transfers, the additional time a sender may need to communicate with persons abroad, and the lack of information about problems associated with this time period, the Bureau does not believe that using its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to change this time period is currently warranted.",
                                "Industry commenters also requested that the sender be required to assert an error in writing at a centralized address. The Bureau believes that requiring senders to assert an error in writing would have a chilling effect on the error resolution process, especially given that some senders may not feel comfortable writing in English. Although in some cases, a sender may have the ability to assert the error in a foreign language and be assured a response in that language, that ability may depend on the foreign languages used at the office of the remittance transfer provider where the error is asserted to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers under \u00a7 1005.31(g), as discussed above. Moreover, the current error resolution process for EFTs does not require a consumer to assert an error in writing.\n          Therefore, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1).",
                                "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(2) provided that when a notice of error was based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error would be timely if it were received by the provider no later than 60 days after the provider sends the requested documentation, information, or clarification. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed 60-day time frame for the sender to provide a new notice of error following the sender's receipt of documentation, information, or clarification from the remittance transfer provider is consistent with the 60-day time frame established for similar circumstances under the general error resolution provisions in Regulation E, \u00a7 1005.11(b)(3).",
                                "The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning that under these circumstances, 60 days, rather than the 180-day error resolution time frame generally applicable to remittance transfers, provides sufficient time for a sender to review the additional information provided by the remittance transfer provider and determine whether an error occurred in connection with a transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. However, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to clarify that a sender always has the original 180 days after the disclosed date of availability to assert an error. Consequently, the Bureau is amending proposed \u00a7 205.33(b)(2), renumbered as \u00a7 1005.33(b)(2), to provide that when a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification requested.",
                                "The Board proposed commentary to clarify proposed \u00a7 205.33(b). Proposed comment 33(b)-1 clarified that the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender of the transfer. Thus, a notice of error provided by the designated recipient would not trigger the remittance transfer provider's error resolution obligations. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this interpretation is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), which establishes error resolution obligations for a remittance transfer provider only when a notice is received from the sender.\n          Proposed comment 33(b)-1 also clarified that the error resolution provisions do not apply when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment, which the Bureau adopts as proposed.",
                                "The Board proposed comment 33(b)-2 to provide that a notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. As explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender could provide in the notice of error the confirmation number or code given to the sender for the pick-up of a remittance transfer to identify the particular transfer in their tracking systems and records, or any other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the remittance transfer, if such number or code is sufficient to enable the provider to identify the transfer.",
                                "One industry commenter requested that, for an account-based remittance transfer, the final rule require senders to include the account number in the notice of error. The Bureau notes that under comment 11(b)(1)-1 for EFTs, consumers are not required to provide their account numbers and need only provide sufficient information to enable the financial institution to identify the account. Similarly, the Bureau believes that a sender need not provide the account number, but must provide enough information such that the remittance transfer provider can identify the account and the transfer in question. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-2 with this clarification, and also makes other clarifying changes to comment 33(b)-2 to make the comment consistent with \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1).",
                                "Proposed comment 33(b)-3 provided that a remittance transfer provider may request, or the sender may provide, an email address of the sender or the designated recipient, as applicable, instead of a physical address if the email address would be sufficient to enable the provider to identify the remittance transfer to which the notice applies. Proposed comment 33(b)-4 provided that if the sender fails to provide a timely notice of error within 180 days from the stated date of delivery, the remittance transfer provider would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements set forth in the rule. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed comment 33(b)-4 is similar to comment 11(b)(1)-7 for EFTs. The Bureau did not receive any comments on these proposed comments. Therefore, the Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-3 substantially as proposed.",
                                "However, given that a sender may provide a second notice of error based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender requested pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(b)(2), as discussed above, the Bureau is revising comment 33(b)-4 to include the time periods relevant to \u00a7 1005.33(b)(2). Consequently, comment 33(b)-4 provides that, if applicable, a remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.",
                                "The Board proposed comment 33(b)-5 to provide that a notice of error from a sender received by a remittance transfer provider's agent is deemed to be received by the provider for purposes of the 180-day time frame for reporting errors under \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(i). Some industry commenters suggested that senders should only be permitted to assert an error at a centralized address or telephone number. These commenters noted that because remittance transfers are not the primary business for most or all of the agents of a remittance transfer provider, relying on an agent to properly forward disputes and relevant supporting documents to the remittance transfer provider would impose unnecessary costs on agents. Commenters also argued that introducing agents into the error resolution process would increase the likelihood that disputes would not be handled and resolved in a timely way.",
                                "As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender that has a problem or issue with a particular remittance transfer may contact the agent location that the sender used to send the transfer to resolve the problem or issue, rather than notifying the provider directly. The Bureau agrees with the Board that because in many cases, for transfers sent through money transmitters, it will be the agent with whom the sender has a direct relationship, and not the provider, it is appropriate to treat a notice of error given to the agent as notice to the provider. This approach also ensures that a sender does not lose his or her error resolution rights merely because the sender was unaware of a need to directly notify the provider. This is consistent with the approach the Bureau is taking with respect to a sender asserting his or her right to cancel, as discussed in further detail below in comment 34(a)-4. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the comment does not require the agent to perform the error resolution procedures. Remittance transfer providers may require their agents to pass on any error notice they receive to the remittance transfer providers, who can then fulfill the requirements of \u00a7 1005.33. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(b)-5 substantially as proposed.",
                                "Finally, proposed comment 33(b)-6 cross-referenced the disclosure requirements in \u00a7 205.31 to reiterate that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt under \u00a7 205.31(b)(2) or combined disclosure under \u00a7 205.31(b)(3), as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of error resolution rights that is substantially similar to the model error resolution and cancellation notice set forth in Appendix A of this regulation (Model Form A-36). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-6 substantially as proposed."

Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire \u201cexceptions\u201d (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.",
                                "The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. See \u00a7 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.",
                                "To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, \u00a7 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.",
                                "EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under \u00a7 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.",
                                "Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue."

Proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), respectively, for an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. See \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.",
                                "However, as discussed above with respect to proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.",
                                "Therefore, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.",
                                "The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.",
                                "The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.",
                                "The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-2 to clarify \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2). The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.",
                                "Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. See comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.",
                                "For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.",
                                "Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).",
                                "New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.",
                                "In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide \u201csuch other remedy\u201d as the Board determines appropriate \u201cfor the protection of senders.\u201d Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.",
                                "Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.",
                                "Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed \u00a7 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed \u00a7 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).",
                                "The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.",
                                "Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.",
                                "Moreover, consistent with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.",
                                "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.",
                                "Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.",
                                "However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.",
                                "Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.",
                                "Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.",
                                "In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. See comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.",
                                "Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. See comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. See \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.",
                                "Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of \u201camount appropriate to resolve the error.\u201d The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.",
                                "Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.",
                                "The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.",
                                "Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.",
                                "Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.",
                                "Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.",
                                "The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) and the remedy in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the \u201camount appropriate to resolve the error\u201d would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) or (2) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.",
                                "Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.",

This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10."

The Bureau notes that EFTA section 916 was not amended to include the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers set forth in EFTA section 919(d). As such, under EFTA section 916, a court could find that there is civil liability even for an error that has been resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures in \u00a7 1005.33.

In the absence of direct knowledge that a particular EFT was used to fund a remittance transfer, the account-holding institution would face significant compliance risk if the error resolution requirements under proposed \u00a7 205.33 were deemed to apply to the error.",

The comment provides examples to illustrate when certain error resolution procedures apply to a remittance transfer provider that is also the account-holding institution from which the transfer is funded. In the first example, a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under \u00a7 1005.33, such as an omission of an EFT from a periodic statement. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. In the second example, a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under \u00a7 1005.11, such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.",

Proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) provided that, in such a case, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, would apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements under proposed \u00a7 205.33. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) also stated that if the sender instead provides a notice of error asserting an incorrect payment amount involving the use of a credit card to the remittance transfer provider, then the error resolution provisions of proposed \u00a7 205.33 would apply to the remittance transfer provider.",
                        "A creditor of a credit card or other credit account may also act as a remittance transfer provider in certain circumstances, such as when a cardholder sends funds from his or her credit card through a service offered by the creditor to a recipient in a foreign country. In this case, an error could potentially be asserted under either Regulation Z or the error resolution provisions applicable to remittance transfers in the case of an incorrect extension of credit in connection with the transfer. The Board proposed that under these circumstances, the error resolution provisions under Regulation Z \u00a7 1026.13 would apply to the alleged error, but solicited comment on the proposed approach.",
                        "One commenter suggested that if a remittance transfer provider is serving multiple roles, such as a creditor that is also a remittance transfer provider, the remittance transfer provider should have the ability to choose which error resolution procedure to follow. The Bureau does not believe that remittance transfer providers should be permitted to choose the error resolution procedure to apply because providers and senders would benefit from the application of consistent procedures in similar situations.",
                        "The Bureau agrees with the Board that it is reasonable to apply the Regulation Z error resolution provisions under circumstances where the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor because Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d)(1) permits a consumer to withhold disputed amounts while an error is being investigated. However, the Bureau believes that the additional time afforded to a sender to assert an error under \u00a7 1005.33 may also be of value. Therefore, for a remittance transfer provider that is also the creditor, the Bureau is requiring that the time period to assert an error under \u00a7 1005.33(b) should apply instead of the time period under 12 CFR 1026.13(b). This will also ensure that the error resolution notice required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) is consistent. Otherwise, disclosing to a sender that the time period to assert an error may in some instances be 60 days from the periodic statement reflecting the error and in other instances may be 180 days from the disclosed date of availability on the remittance transfer receipt could be confusing.",
                        "The Bureau also believes further clarification is warranted for errors other than incorrect extensions of credit in connection with the remittance transfer. For example, an error involving an incorrect amount of currency received under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) may be asserted as an error involving goods or services that have not been delivered as agreed under \u00a7 1026.13(a)(3). Accordingly, the Bureau is adding these references to the final rule to resolve any potential conflicts. The Bureau adopts \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(f)(2) with these revisions and amendments to clarify that the provision applies to all credit accounts rather than only credit card accounts.",
                        "In addition, the Bureau notes that in certain circumstances, a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims or defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1). These rights are independent of other billing error rights a cardholder may have. See comment 12(c)-1 to 12 CFR 1026.12(c). Therefore, the Bureau is adopting a new comment 33(f)-2 to clarify that to the extent a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer under 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), nothing in \u00a7 1005.33 limits a sender's right in this regard.",
                        "The Board also proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) to provide guidance where an alleged error involves an unauthorized EFT or unauthorized use of a credit card to send a remittance transfer, such as when a stolen debit or credit card is used to send funds to a foreign country. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) clarified that the consumer would have rights under Regulation E \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT or Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card. However, since the consumer holding the asset account or the credit card account is not the sender of the remittance transfer, proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) stated that the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers would not apply. See comment 33(b)-1. The Bureau agrees with the Board's proposal, and \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(f)(3) with an amendment to clarify application of the provision to credit accounts generally as opposed to only credit card accounts.",
                        "Some industry commenters suggested that the reasoning the Board used in applying Regulation E \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT and Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card, should be used in applying UCC Article 4A provisions to an unauthorized wire transfer. As discussed above in the supplementary information to \u00a7 1005.30(e), UCC Article 4A-108 provides that Article 4A does not apply \u201cto a funds transfer, any part of which is governed by the [EFTA]\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed above, the Bureau may only preempt State law to the extent that there is an inconsistency. Since the Bureau does not believe there is an inconsistency between the EFTA and UCC Article 4A-108, UCC Article 4A does not apply to wire transfers that are remittance transfers under \u00a7 1005.30(e). Therefore, the Bureau declines to implement commenters' suggestion with respect to unauthorized wire transfers.",
                        "Finally, the Board noted that in certain cases a consumer may be able to assert error resolution rights in connection with a remittance transfer with both the remittance transfer provider as well as the account-holding institution or credit card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 33(f)-2 addressed this situation by providing that if a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or the sender's account-holding institution or creditor, and then subsequently asserts the same error with the other party, the other party would have no further responsibilities to investigate the error. The proposed comment also clarified that an account-holding institution or creditor may reverse amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if the consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same error and provided an example to illustrate this concept.",
                        "One industry commenter noted that the provisions in \u00a7 1005.33(f) could provide a consumer with potentially different error resolution procedures depending on who the consumer decides to contact. This may be the case if the remittance transfer provider is not also the account-holding institution or creditor. However, proposed comment 33(f)-2 explains that the second party has no error resolution obligations if the sender already received credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer. This comment makes clear that a consumer may not receive a windfall by successfully asserting an error with both the provider and the account-holding institution and/or credit card issuer or creditor.",
                        "Another industry commenter suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to delay providing a remedy until expiration of the card issuer's chargeback right under network rules to prevent duplicate recoveries when remittances are funded by a debit card or a credit card. The Bureau believes that the delay would be disadvantageous for senders in getting a speedy resolution to an error and that proposed comment 33(f)-2 is a better method for dealing with the possibility of duplicate recoveries. The Bureau adopts this comment, renumbered as comment 33(f)-3, substantially as proposed.",
                        "Lastly, the Bureau received comment from an industry commenter questioning which error resolution provisions apply when a sender has multiple funding sources for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender could fund a remittance transfer partly by a balance in the sender's account held by the remittance transfer provider and partly by a credit card or an ACH transfer from the sender's checking account. In such cases, the Bureau notes that which error resolution procedure will apply depends on the error that is asserted. For example, if the error asserted is the incorrect extension of credit in connection with the remittance transfer, then \u00a7 1005.33(f)(2) provides that \u00a7 1026.13 applies to the creditor while \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor, only \u00a7 1026.13 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card.",
                        "Similarly, if the error asserted is an incorrect EFT from a sender's account, then \u00a7 1005.33(f)(1) provides that \u00a7 1005.11 applies to the account-holding institution while \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the account-holding institution, only \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. The Bureau believes the regulation and commentary as adopted provide sufficient guidance in this regard, and additional clarification is not necessary."

EFTA section 919(d)(2) specifically provides that such standards must include appropriate standards regarding recordkeeping, including retention of certain error-resolution related documentation. The Board proposed \u00a7 205.33(g) to implement these error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements.",
                        "Specifically, proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with respect to the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers. The proposed rule also stated that remittance transfer providers must take steps to ensure that whenever a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this approach is similar to one taken by the Federal banking agencies in other contexts. See, e.g., 12 CFR 1022.90(e) (requiring that an identity theft red flags program exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service-provider arrangements).",

The Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers must develop written policies and procedures in order to demonstrate compliance to the appropriate regulator. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe the requirement to maintain written policies and procedures that the remittance transfer provider must follow imposes any additional burden.",
                        "The Bureau is making one change to proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1).

The Bureau believes that this provision is no longer necessary in light of the decision under \u00a7 1005.35, discussed below, to provide that a remittance transfer provider is liable for any violation of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1), as revised, is adopted in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(g)(1).",
                        "Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) a remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures concerning error resolution would be required to include provisions regarding the retention of documentation related to an error investigation. Such provisions would be required to ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error, which is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(2).",
                        "Proposed comment 33(g)-1 clarified that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13, which apply to any person subject to the EFTA. Accordingly, remittance transfer providers would be required to retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. Similar to comment 13-1, proposed comment 33(g)-1 provided that the record retention requirements do not require a remittance transfer provider to maintain records of individual disclosures of remittance transfers that it has provided to each sender. Instead, a provider need only retain records to ensure that it can comply with a sender's request for documentation or other information relating to a particular remittance transfer, including a request for supporting documentation to enable the sender to determine whether an error exists with respect to that transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) or proposed comment 33(g)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(g)(2), but with an amendment to make clear that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13.

In the proposal, the Board recognized that remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer generally cannot be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. See, e.g., UCC Article 4A-211 (providing that a payment order cannot be cancelled or amended once it has been accepted unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank). The Board stated that it believed that under such circumstances, a bank or credit union making transfers by ACH or wire transfer would likely wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period had passed, which could delay the receipt of the funds in the foreign country. The Board stated that one business day would provide a reasonable time frame for a sender to evaluate whether to cancel a remittance transfer after providing payment for the transfer, but requested comment regarding whether the proposed minimum time period should be longer or shorter than proposed.",

One industry commenter believed a cancellation right was unnecessary for remittance transfers because fees incurred by the sender for a remittance transfer were minimal. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that a cancellation right would give senders less incentive to provide accurate information. One industry commenter believed senders could use the cancellation right to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates. The industry commenter believed remittance transfer providers would increase exchange rates to compensate for the risk of loss.",

Some industry commenters believed that the delay in processing would make it more difficult to determine an exchange rate. A member of Congress urged the Bureau to take into consideration senders' expectation for timely execution of remittance transfers in determining the appropriate cancellation period. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed a sender would want to remit funds as quickly as possible, and that the proposed cancellation right could cause senders to make payments using remittance mechanisms that are not subject to Regulation E.",

These commenters suggested that a study could help the Bureau determine that decreasing the cancellation period could adequately protect senders. Many industry commenters believed that if the Bureau required a cancellation period, the period should be shorter than one business day. The commenters suggested a variety of shorter cancellation periods that could be more appropriate. Some industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to the same day or an hour. Several industry commenters believed the right to cancel should end when the remittance transfer provider executes the payment instruction. Several industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to 30 minutes, noting that this time period would be consistent with Texas law.",
                        "Some industry commenters suggested that institutions sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer should be exempt from the cancellation rules. Other industry commenters suggested that a sender should have the right to opt out of the cancellation right to have the transfer sent immediately. Another industry commenter suggested that the provider should only be required to cancel if the provider has a reasonable opportunity to act upon the request. One industry commenter believed a right to refund remittance transfers that are unclaimed was a more appropriate cancellation policy. An industry commenter believed the provider should not be required to honor cancellation requests that are made for fraudulent purposes.",
                        "Other industry commenters believed the cancellation rules should be disclosure-based. One industry commenter believed that instead of a cancellation right, the provider should disclose that once a sender signs the remittance transaction agreement, it cannot be cancelled and that a failure to carry out a sender's cancellation request once a remittance agreement has been signed is not an error. Another industry commenter believed that if a provider had a cancellation policy, that the Bureau should require that it be properly disclosed.",
                        "The Bureau believes that a cancellation right could be helpful to senders of remittance transfers. The Bureau also believes, however, that providers sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer likely will delay transactions for the length of the cancellation period because such transfers are often difficult to retract once they are sent. A cancellation period of one business day thus could prevent a sender from sending a remittance transfer quickly. In addition, a long cancellation period could create an unfair competitive advantage for closed network money transmitters, who are less likely to delay sending a remittance transfer until the end of the cancellation period. Therefore, the Bureau believes a cancellation period shorter than one business day is appropriate.",
                        "The final rule requires a 30-minute cancellation period.\n        A 30-minute cancellation period provides the sender the opportunity to review both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt to ensure that the transfer was sent as the sender intended. However, the 30-minute cancellation period should not substantially delay transactions for senders who want to send funds quickly. The Bureau notes that 30 minutes is the minimum time that a provider must allow senders to cancel transactions, but providers may choose to permit senders to cancel transactions after the 30 minute period has passed. Moreover, even after the cancellation period has passed, senders may still assert their rights under \u00a7 1005.33 and obtain a refund or other remedy for transactions where an error occurred.",
                        "As discussed above, the final rule sets forth new cancellation requirements in a new \u00a7 1005.36 with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau believes that when a sender schedules a remittance transfer more than three days in advance of when the remittance transfer is made, a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to a sender. In those circumstances, the Bureau believes a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after scheduling the transfer to be made, given the potentially significant delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. Circumstances could change in the intervening period that would negate the purpose of the transfer. At the same time, allowing the sender to cancel certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance for up to 30 minutes after the transfer is made could be burdensome to both senders and providers. A sender may not know the precise time of day that the transfer is scheduled, and such a rule would extend the period of uncertainty for providers, who may delay a transfer until the cancellation period has expired. Consequently, the 30-minute cancellation period described in \u00a7 1005.34(a) does not apply to remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and a remittance transfer provider must instead comply with the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(c).",
                        "Section 1005.34(a) of the final rule provides that, except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(c), a remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if the following two conditions are met.",
                        "First, under proposed \u00a7 205.34(a)(1), a valid request to cancel a remittance transfer must enable the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled. Proposed comment 34(a)-1 clarified that the request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the transfer. The proposed comment also permitted the provider to request, or the sender to provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the provider can identify the transfer to which the cancellation request applies.",
                        "Second, proposed \u00a7 205.34(a)(2) provided that a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer is effective so long as the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into an account held by the recipient.\n        Proposed comment 34(a)-2 reiterated that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer in the receipt or combined notice, as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment clarified that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer.",
                        "The Bureau did not receive comment on the two conditions on the right to cancel. The final rule adopts the two conditions as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, the Bureau adopts comments 34(a)-1 and 34(a)-2 substantially as proposed.",
                        "The Bureau is also adding comment 34(a)-3 to explain how a remittance transfer provider could comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The comment states that a provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. The comment clarifies that a provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.",
                        "One industry commenter believed that the Bureau should require a sender to contact the remittance transfer provider directly in order to cancel a transaction. The commenter believed that agents should not be required to handle cancellation requests, noting that under certain State laws, the agent does not have a right to the funds paid for a remittance transfer and therefore could not make a refund.",
                        "The Bureau believes that a sender's cancellation request should be valid if the sender contacts the agent. Many participants in consumer testing indicated that they would contact an agent first if they encountered a problem with their remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that requiring a sender to contact a remittance transfer provider by, for example, calling the telephone number listed on the receipt could frustrate the sender's ability to cancel within the 30-minute cancellation period. Consequently, the Bureau clarifies in comment 34(a)-4 that a cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.34(a) when received by the agent. The Bureau understands, however, that an agent may not be able to provide a sender with the refund for legal or operational reasons, and, as discussed below, the final rule does not require an agent to provide a refund if the agent is unable to do so.",
                        "Finally, the Bureau is adding a comment to clarify when a sender makes a payment for a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when the 30-minute cancellation period has passed. Comment 34(a)-5 clarifies that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 205.34(b) established the time frames and refund requirements applicable to remittance transfer cancellation requests. The proposed rule stated that a remittance transfer provider must refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees imposed in connection with the requested transfer, within three business days of receiving the sender's valid cancellation request.",
                        "Many industry commenters objected to the requirement in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to refund the total amount of funds to the sender. Industry commenters believed that requiring a refund of the total amount of funds raised significant safety and soundness concerns for institutions sending wire transfers because some remittance transfer providers would be unable to recover the funds from subsequent institutions in a transfer chain. One money transmitter commenter stated that once a transfer is booked at an agent location, the provider is obligated to pay the agent its portion of the transfer fees for the transaction. If a sender cancels the transaction after settlement, the provider would be required to negotiate the return of the fee from the agent or bear the total loss of the fee. Similarly, the commenter noted that it acted as an agent of international billers and is obligated to the billers for the funds when it sends data to the biller. Several industry commenters believed requiring a remittance transfer provider to refund all fees could increase costs for senders, since providers may increase fees to account for losses due to refund. A money transmitter commenter also argued that refunding a third party fee or tax could be impermissible under local law.",
                        "Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau permit a remittance transfer provider to charge reasonable fees, even if the sender cancels the transaction. Some of the commenters noted that this was consistent with a bank's ability to charge fees in connection with a stop payment order on a check to cover the bank's costs. An industry trade association believed providers should be permitted to charge a $45 fee to stop the transaction. Another industry commenter suggested that if the exchange rate changes between the time the order is placed and the refund is requested such that the amount of local currency originally promised would be equivalent to less U.S. dollars, the refund of the principal should be at the new exchange rate.",
                        "Some commenters believed a remittance transfer provider should not be required to provide a refund in certain circumstances. One industry commenter believed a provider should not be required to refund fees charged by intermediaries. Another industry commenter suggested that a provider should not have to refund the portion of any fees that are not attributable to costs incurred by them prior to receiving a cancellation request. A trade association believed a provider should not be required to refund fees when the provider has not made any errors.",
                        "The Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a provider to refund the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau believes senders could be discouraged from exercising their cancellation rights if they could not recover the cost of the remittance transfer. Although the Bureau recognizes that a provider may not be able to recover some fees or taxes charged for a transfer, the Bureau believes that the shorter cancellation period adopted in the final rule helps address these concerns. Under the final rule, a provider can mitigate some of the risk of losing fees or taxes charged for a transfer by sending a transfer after the 30-minute cancellation period ends. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring the total amount of funds provided by the sender to be refunded in the final rule in \u00a7 1005.34(b) with the additional clarification that refunding the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer requires a provider to refund taxes on the remittance transfer. However, as noted by one industry commenter, for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Consequently, the requirement in \u00a7 1005.34(b) to refund taxes is only to the extent such refund is not prohibited by law. In the final rule, \u00a7 1005.34(b) provides that a remittance transfer provider shall refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.",
                        "Proposed comment 34(b)-1 addressed the permissible ways in which a provider could provide a refund. The proposed comment clarified that a remittance transfer provider may, at the provider's discretion, issue a refund in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially tendered by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment.",
                        "The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 34(b)-1. However, as discussed above regarding comment 33(c)-6, the Bureau is amending comment 34(b)-1 with respect to refunds if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. Specifically, comment 34(b)-1 states that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.",
                        "The Bureau is also finalizing comment 34(b)-2, which addresses costs that must be refunded upon a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with amendments clarifying that all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer would include taxes that are assessed by a State or other governmental body, to the extent not prohibited by law. Therefore, the final comment states that if a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.",
                        "Finally, industry commenters suggested amendments to the requirement in the proposal to provide a refund within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer. One industry commenter believed the refund rule should not require the refund to be delivered to the sender within three business days. The commenter cited examples of when it could be difficult to deliver the funds to the sender in three days, such as when the provider mails a refund check and the check takes several days to be delivered to the sender; when the refund is available at an agent location, but the sender takes several days to pick-up the refund; and when the provider issues a chargeback to the sender's credit or debit card account, but the credit takes several days to appear due to card processing systems. The Bureau notes that the requirement to refund funds to a sender does not require a provider to ensure that a refund is delivered to a sender within three business days after receiving the sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer."

EFTA section 919(f)(1) generally makes remittance transfer providers liable for any violation of EFTA section 919 by an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with such provider, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. EFTA section 919(f)(2) requires the Bureau to prescribe rules to implement appropriate standards or conditions of liability of a remittance transfer provider, including one that acts through its agent or authorized delegate.",
                "The Board proposed two alternatives to implement EFTA section 919(f) with respect to acts of agents. Under the first alternative (proposed Alternative A), a remittance transfer provider would be strictly liable for violations of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Under the second alternative (proposed Alternative B), a remittance transfer provider would be liable under the EFTA for violations by an agent acting for the provider, unless the provider establishes and maintains policies and procedures for agent compliance, including appropriate oversight measures, and the provider corrects any violation, to the extent appropriate.",
                "Consumer groups, State regulators, and a Federal Reserve Bank supported proposed Alternative A. These commenters stated that Alternative A would provide the greatest incentives for remittance transfer providers to avoid errors and to oversee and audit their agents. Some argued that proposed Alternative A would be consistent with many State laws, and that adopting proposed Alternative B could disrupt efforts to hold providers to stricter liability standards under State law.",
                "In contrast, industry commenters supported the liability standard set forth in proposed Alternative B. These commenters argued that proposed Alternative B would more appropriately address the unique position of agents in the market, while providing protection for consumers by making them whole for the cost of the remittance transfer. These commenters also stated that proposed Alternative B would create an incentive for providers to take an active role in developing compliance policies and procedures and engaging in agent oversight. These commenters also expressed concern about the liability risks associated with proposed Alternative A for the misconduct or a single agent or isolated violations, and that proposed Alternative A could discourage the use of agents.",
                "Based on comments received and the Bureau's further analysis, the final rule adopts proposed Alternative A in renumbered \u00a7 1005.35. The Bureau believes that the approach taken in proposed Alternative A is more consistent with the approach generally taken in other Bureau regulations, including Regulation E. For example, under Regulation E's payroll card rules, a financial institution is required to provide initial payroll card disclosures to a payroll account holder. If, by contractual agreement with the institution, a third-party service provider or the employer agrees to deliver these disclosures on the institution's behalf and fails to do so, the issuing financial institution is nonetheless liable for the violation.\n      Similarly, if an agent at a retail establishment fails to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider would be liable. The Bureau also believes that proposed Alternative A provides a greater incentive for providers to monitor their agents' activities and to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight than proposed Alternative B.",
                "One commenter suggested that proposed Alternative A could exculpate an agent from responsibility from its own conduct. However, nothing in the rule shields agents from liability, nor does it prevent providers from requiring specific agent conduct in their contracts or negotiating other contractual liability or indemnification clauses.",
                "With respect to commenters' concerns about liability risk, EFTA section 919(f)(2) states that enforcement agencies may consider, in any action or other proceeding against a remittance transfer provider, the extent to which the provider had established and maintained policies or procedures for compliance, including policies, procedures, or other appropriate oversight measures designed to assure compliance by an agent or authorized delegate acting for such provider. Thus, enforcement agencies are permitted to tailor any remedies in light of single agent non-compliance or isolated violations.",
                "Several commenters requested further guidance on what it means for an agent to act for a provider. As discussed in the proposal, some agents have a non-exclusive arrangement with several remittance transfer providers, so that a sender may choose from among the remittance transfer providers at that agent location. If a sender chooses to use Provider A to send funds at the agent location, then Provider B would not be liable for the agent's actions in connection with that transaction, because the agent would be acting for Provider A. As noted above regarding the definition of \u201cagent\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(a), the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to defer to State or other applicable law with respect to the relationship between an agent and Provider A.",
                "The final rule also adopts proposed Alternative A's comment 35-1 substantially as proposed. Comment 35-1 explains that remittance transfer providers remain fully responsible for complying with the requirements of this subpart, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in \u00a7 1005.31 and remedying any errors as set forth in \u00a7 1005.33. This is the case even if a remittance transfer provider performs its functions through an agent, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient."

As noted above, most industry commenters argued that these transfers should be excluded from the final rule. These commenters argued that the provider would not be in a position to know, at the time disclosures are required, the applicable exchange rate for transfers that are scheduled to be sent at a later date.",
                "For the reasons discussed above in the supplementary information to \u00a7 1005.30(e), the final rule does not exclude online bill payments from the definition of \u201cremittance transfer,\u201d nor does it exclude certain other remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Thus, the final rule generally requires that disclosures be provided in accordance with the timing and accuracy rules set forth in \u00a7 1005.31, both with respect to the required pre-payment disclosure and the required receipt. Estimates may be disclosed, to the extent permitted by \u00a7 1005.32.",
                "However, the Bureau believes that preauthorized remittance transfers, whether for bill payments or for other reasons, raise issues relating to the practical aspects of compliance, and potential consumer confusion issues. As discussed above, \u00a7 1005.31(e) links the timing requirements for providing pre-payment disclosures and receipts to senders to the time when the transfer is requested and payment is made by the sender. Similarly, the disclosure accuracy rule in \u00a7 1005.31(f) relates to when the sender's payment is made. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. See comments 31(e)-2 and 34(a)-5. Accordingly, if all preauthorized remittance transfers were subject to \u00a7 1005.31, providers would have to provide both pre-payment disclosures and receipts at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers are requested and authorized by the sender. Moreover, these disclosures would need to be accurate for the first and all subsequent transfers scheduled in the future (except to the extent estimates are permitted by \u00a7 1005.32).",
                "The Bureau believes that in some circumstances, it is impracticable for providers to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent transfers at the time preauthorized remittance transfers are authorized. For example, while a provider may be able to know or to hedge for a specified exchange rate with respect to the first transfer, the provider or the institution involved in the remittance transfer that sets the exchange rate may be reluctant to set a specified exchange rate applicable to all subsequent transfers that are scheduled to be made into the future. This reluctance could arise due to the risk associated with participating in foreign exchange markets, and the manners in which providers and their partners manage such risk. Many wholesale exchange rates are set largely through currency markets in which rates can fluctuate frequently.\n      As a result, whenever there are time lags in between the time when the retail rate applied to a transfer is set, the time when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and the time when funds are delivered, a provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency.",
                "Providers and/or their partners generally use a variety of pricing, business processes, or hedging techniques to manage or minimize this exchange rate risk. For some, and perhaps many providers (or their partners), the task of managing or minimizing exchange risk may become more complicated or more costly if the amount of time between when the rate is set for a customer and when the transfer is sent increases. Setting the retail rate that applies to a transfer far in advance of when that transfer is sent may require the provider or other parties involved in processing the remittance transfer to use additional or more sophisticated risk management tools.",
                "Some preauthorized remittance transfers may be set up to vary in amount (for example, based on the amount of a utilities bill). In such cases, while the remittance transfer provider may know the amount to be transferred in the first payment, the provider may not know, at the time the sender authorizes the preauthorized remittance transfer, the amounts that will be transferred in subsequent months. Moreover, even if the scheduled amounts to be transferred were fixed, and a provider were permitted to disclose an estimated exchange rate for future payments, providing estimated exchange rates at the time of the initial request for transfers beyond the first transfer may not be useful to senders\u2014and could even be misleading\u2014because currency fluctuations over several months could cause the actual rate applied to particular transfers to vary substantially. The Bureau recognizes that the market for preauthorized remittance transfers is still developing. Consequently, the Bureau is concerned that if providers were required to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers at the time those transfers are authorized, in many cases providers would not be able to offer preauthorized remittance transfer products, which could limit consumer access to a potentially valuable product.",
                "The Bureau also believes that the right to cancel a remittance transfer no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment as provided in \u00a7 1005.34(a) is not appropriate when applied to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. When a sender schedules a remittance transfer many days\u2014or even months\u2014in advance of when the transfer is to be made, a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after requesting the transfer, given the delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. In such circumstances, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers can accommodate a longer cancellation period without the risk that a sender's cancellation would delay the remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau believes that a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to senders.",
                "Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new \u00a7 1005.36, which sets forth disclosure requirements specifically applicable to preauthorized remittance transfers, as well as specific cancellation requirements for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(a) and (b) address specific requirements for the timing and accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(c) addresses the cancellation requirements applicable to any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Because \u00a7 1005.36 only addresses timing, accuracy, and cancellation requirements, the other requirements of subpart B, such as content and formatting requirements and the foreign language requirements, continue to apply to remittance transfers subject to \u00a7 1005.36. See comment 36-1.",

If the general timing rule in \u00a7 1005.31(e) applied, the provider would be required to provide a pre-payment disclosure at the time the scheduled payments are authorized. By requiring a pre-payment disclosure at this alternative time for each subsequent transfer, senders will receive information about their transfers in closer proximity to the scheduled transfer date, and the provider should be in a better position to make the required disclosures. This approach also reminds senders about the pending transfer, which will enable them to confirm that sufficient funds are available for the transfer. In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on a safe harbor with respect to the reasonable time requirement.",

As with pre-payment disclosures, the Bureau does not believe a receipt given at the time payment for the transfer is authorized would be as useful to senders as a receipt received closer in time to the actual transfer that contains more relevant information about the particular scheduled transfer. The final rule requires the receipt to be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. However, if the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.

The Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel a transaction no later than 30 minutes after payment is authorized would not be appropriate for certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Such a rule would permit cancellation only for a short time after the transfers are authorized, even though the remittance transfer may not occur for many days, weeks, or months. For example, if on March 1 a sender scheduled a remittance transfer for March 23, under the general cancellation rule, the sender would be required to cancel 30 minutes after the transfer was authorized on March 1, despite the fact that the transfer is not being made until March 23. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a different cancellation period in these circumstances because payment is authorized well before the transfer is to be made.",
                        "Consequently, the Bureau is adopting a special cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.36(c) that it believes is more appropriate for these types of transfers. Section 1005.36(c) states that, for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.",
                        "The Bureau believes that this time period is more beneficial to senders because it generally provides them more time to decide whether to go through with a scheduled transfer. Senders will have the opportunity to change their minds about sending a transfer if, for example, circumstances change between when the transfer is authorized and when the transfer is to be made. At the same time, the Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel at least three days before a transfer is made gives providers sufficient time to process any cancellation requests before a transfer is made. Many financial institutions that permit senders to schedule remittance transfers at least three business days before the date of the transfer are already subject to the stop payment provisions in Regulation E for preauthorized transfers that are EFTs, which require consumers to notify the institution at least three business days before the scheduled date of a preauthorized EFT. See \u00a7 1005.10(c).",
                        "The cancellation provisions in both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.34(a) and 1005.36(c) permit a sender to cancel a remittance transfer after the transfer has been authorized. Under both provisions, a cancellation period may expire before the transfer itself is made. As noted above, the Bureau expects financial institutions making transfers by ACH or wire transfer may decide to wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period has passed because these types of remittance transfers generally cannot easily be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. For the same reason, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a sender to cancel before a transfer is made in \u00a7 1005.36(c).",
                        "Under \u00a7 1005.36(c), a transfer must be cancelled only if the request to cancel is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer, so that a provider has sufficient time to prevent the transfer from taking place on the scheduled date. Therefore, under the final rule, only transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(c). Remittance transfers that are scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.34(a). For example, if a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3, the sender may cancel up to 30 minutes after scheduling the payment on March 1. Thus, in every case, a sender has an opportunity to cancel a remittance transfer.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of \u00a7 1005.36(c). Comment 36(c)-1 clarifies that a remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.",
                        "Comment 36(c)-1 also clarifies three circumstances where the provisions of \u00a7 1005.36(c) do not apply, such that a provider should instead comply with the 30-minute cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.34. For example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3. In this instance, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer is scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(c) also does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer. In this example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer requires further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.",
                        "The other example in comment 36(c)-1 demonstrates situations where \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time and not because a sender schedules the transfer at least three business days before the date of the transfer. For example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds are not deducted from the sender's account until March 5.",
                        "Comment 36(c)-2 clarifies how a remittance transfer provider should treat requests to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers in a manner consistent with the stop payment provisions of Regulation E. See \u00a7 1005.10(c) and comment 10(c)-2. The comment clarifies that for preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.",
                        "Finally, comment 36(c)-3 clarifies that a financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under \u00a7 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under \u00a7 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under \u00a7 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of \u00a7 1005.36 exclusively apply. The Bureau notes that in these circumstances, a provider would not be permitted to require the sender to give written confirmation of a cancellation within 14 days of an oral notification, as is permitted for stop payment orders in \u00a7 1005.10(c)(2). The Bureau believes that a sender should be able to orally cancel any remittance transfer, including a remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, without the additional burden of providing written confirmation of the cancellation.",
                        "In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the cancellation period for a remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer."

                "The Board proposed in Appendix A twelve model forms that a remittance transfer provider could use in connection with remittance transfers. The disclosures were proposed as model forms pursuant to EFTA section 904(a), rather than model clauses pursuant to EFTA section 904(b), in order to clearly demonstrate the general form and specific format requirements of proposed \u00a7 205.31(a) and (c). Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32 were developed in consumer testing and reflect a format in which the flow and organization of information effectively communicates the remittance disclosures to most consumers. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-41 were intended to demonstrate several formats a remittance transfer provider may use to comply with the disclosure requirements of proposed \u00a7 205.31.",
                "The Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A regarding the use of model forms and added instruction 4 to Appendix A to describe how a remittance transfer provider may properly use and alter the model forms. Specifically, the Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A to include references to remittance transfer providers and remittance transfers and updated the numbering of the liability provisions of the EFTA as sections 916 and 917. The proposed instruction therefore clarified that the use of the proposed model forms in making disclosures would protect a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the EFTA if they accurately reflected the provider's remittance transfer services. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed instruction 2, and it is adopted substantially as proposed, with an addition to reference \u00a7 1005.36 that was added in the final rule.",
                "The Bureau also did not receive any comments on proposed instruction 4 to Appendix A, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The instruction includes one change to address the Bureau's role in reviewing and approving disclosure forms. The instruction also contains modifications to address the addition of \u00a7 1005.36 in the final rule. Accordingly, instruction 4 to Appendix A states that the Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms for remittance transfer providers, but that the appendix contains 12 model forms for use in connection with remittance transfers. The instruction explains that Model Forms A-30 through A-32 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for a remittance transfer exchanged into local currency. Model Forms A-33 through A-35 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for U.S. dollar-to-U.S. dollar remittance transfers. These forms also demonstrate disclosure of the required content, in accordance with the grouping and proximity requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(c)(1) and (2), in both a register receipt format and an 8.5 inch by 11 inch format. Model Form A-36 provides long form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(4), and Model Form A-37 provides short form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) and (vi).",
                "Instruction 4 to Appendix A also explains that a remittance transfer provider may use the language and formatting provided in Forms A-38 through A-41 for disclosures that are required to be provided in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g). It also clarifies that the model forms may contain certain information that is not required by subpart B, such as a confirmation code and the sender's name and contact information. This information is included on the model forms to demonstrate one way of displaying this information in compliance with \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4). Any additional information must be presented consistent with a remittance transfer provider's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.",
                "Instruction 4 to Appendix A further clarifies that use of the model forms is optional. A remittance transfer provider may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making modifications to the language of the forms, without modifying the substance of the disclosures. The instruction clarifies that rearrangement or modification of the format of the model forms is permissible, as long as it is consistent with the form, grouping, proximity, and other requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(a) and (c). Providers making revisions that do not comply with this section will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of Model Forms A-30 to A-41.",
                "Instruction 4 to Appendix A also provides examples of permissible changes a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor. For example, a remittance transfer provider may substitute the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms\u2014such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information\u2014with information applicable to the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also eliminate disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as permitted under \u00a7 1005.31(b), or provide the required disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats. A remittance transfer provider may correct or update telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time. This example applies to all telephone numbers and addresses on a model form, including the contact information of the provider, the State agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The instruction clarifies that adding the term \u201cEstimated\u201d or a substantially similar term and in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, as required under \u00a7 1005.31(d), is a permissible change to the model forms. A provider may provide the required disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g), without losing the benefit of the safe harbor.",
                "Instruction 4 to Appendix A includes an additional example of a permissible change a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor to reflect the addition of \u00a7 1005.36 in the final rule. The instruction clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may substitute cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.36(c). For example, for disclosures provided for a preauthorized remittance transfer, a provider could replace the statement that a sender can cancel the remittance transfer within 30 minutes with a statement that a sender may cancel up to three business days before the date of each transfer. Finally, instruction 4 to Appendix A also clarifies that adding language to a form that is not segregated from the required disclosures is impermissible, other than as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4).",
                "Although the Bureau did not receive comments on the instructions to Model Forms A-30 through A-41, the Bureau did receive suggested changes to the terminology used in and the formatting of the model forms. For example, consumer group commenters believed that the amount of the cost of the transaction expressed as \u201cTotal\u201d in the proposal should be labeled in bold as \u201cTotal cost to you of this transfer\u201d and that \u201cTotal to recipient\u201d should be labeled in bold as \u201cTotal amount recipient should receive.\u201d The commenters also believed the term \u201cTotal Amount\u201d was too generic and instead should be \u201cAmount Transferred.\u201d An industry commenter believed that fees and taxes charged by entities other than the remittance transfer provided should be labeled as \u201cReceive\u201d or \u201cPayout\u201d fees and taxes, rather than \u201cOther\u201d fees and taxes.",
                "The Bureau believes that the proposed terms sufficiently describe the amounts disclosed on the model forms. The proposed terms were used in consumer testing, and nearly all participants understood the amounts that were disclosed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that requiring bolding or similar font requirements could pose compliance difficulties for remittance transfer providers that print the disclosures on a register or other printing device that does not permit such font changes, and participants in consumer testing did not have difficulty finding this information on the forms. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the terms and format as proposed.",
                "Consumer group commenters asserted that the content of the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in Model Form A-36 was misleading and not consumer friendly. The commenters provided edits to the disclosure that the commenter believed would be more helpful to a sender. The long form error resolution and cancellation disclosure is based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. See 31 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3. The Bureau believes that any changes to this model form should be made in conjunction with the corresponding changes to existing Regulation E model forms and that such changes should be subject to consumer testing. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting the content of Model Form A-36 as proposed.",
                "Other commenters suggested substantive changes that, if adopted, would result in changes to the model forms. For example, some industry commenters suggested that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose fees and taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider and that the model forms should instead indicate generally that other fees and charges may apply. Similarly, industry commenters suggested the exchange rate and funds availability date should be permitted to be estimated and, therefore, the model forms should state that these disclosures are subject to change. As discussed above, the Bureau is not adopting these substantive changes in the final rule. Consequently, the Bureau is not adopting the corresponding changes to the model forms.",
                "Finally, a consumer advocate suggested that a fraud warning should be added to the model forms. Such a warning is not required in the statute, and the Bureau believes that the disclosures should be limited to information relating to cost, error resolution, and cancellation. Adding more information and warnings to forms could overwhelm a sender and result in the sender not reading any of the information on the form. Therefore, the Bureau is not adding such a fraud warning to the model disclosures.",
                "The Bureau is, however, making two changes to the model forms that reflect changes from the proposal to the final rule, as discussed above. First, the Bureau is requiring that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. See comment 31(b)(1)-1. As such, the model forms have been amended to demonstrate how a remittance transfer provider would disclose fees separately from taxes. Second, the final rule provides that a sender may cancel a transaction within thirty minutes of making payment, rather than within one business day, as proposed, and the model forms have been amended to reflect this change.",
                "The Bureau is making additional changes to Model Form A-37 in the final rule. The Bureau is removing sample phone number, Web site, and remittance transfer company name that was included in the proposed form. Unlike the model pre-payment disclosures, receipts, and combined disclosures, sample information is not necessary to demonstrate how the short form error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be completed. Thus, in the final rule, Model Form A-37 includes brackets indicating where this information should be entered by a provider. The forward slash used in the proposal to indicate that funds may be picked up or deposited is also replaced with the word \u201cor.\u201d The Bureau is also amending the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights.",
                "The Bureau is also making minor technical changes in some of the model forms in the final rule for clarity. Plus signs are added to some forms to indicate where fees and taxes will be added to a transfer amount to better demonstrate the calculation of the total amount paid by the sender.\n      The internet address for the sample State regulatory agency is also amended on some forms with the suffix \u201c.gov\u201d rather than \u201c.com.\u201d\n      The toll-free telephone numbers for the Bureau have also been added to some forms.",
                "As discussed above, Model Forms A-38 through A-41 may be used when disclosures are required to be disclosed in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(g). The Board proposed model disclosures in Spanish to facilitate compliance with this foreign language requirement and requested comment on the disclosures. One commenter submitted spelling, grammar and verb tense revisions to the Spanish language disclosures. The commenter believed the Spanish language disclosures, as proposed, did not adequately communicate the intent of the language used in the English disclosures.",
                "Certain commenter-suggested revisions have been made in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 to correct inaccuracies in the proposed Spanish language disclosures. However, in other instances, the suggested revisions have not been made. Although the proposed language and the commenter-suggested revisions reflected stylistic variations, both contained accurate translations of the English language model forms. Therefore, the technical corrections are included in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 in the final rule. The Bureau also made stylistic changes to the Spanish language model forms that it believes better tracks the language in the English language disclosures."

However, several other industry commenters recommended that the effective date of the final rule be set 18 to 24 months from the date that the final rule is issued. In suggesting this time period, money transmitter commenters stated that they would need time to change hardware printers and software. Agents of remittance transfer providers would also need time to integrate software from the remittance transfer provider with their point of sale systems. Industry commenters also requested time to deplete their existing form stock, develop and implement proper training programs, and amend contracts with agent locations worldwide.",

See comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.",
        "76":"Due to a scrivener's error, \u00a7 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term \u201cOther Transfer Fees,\u201d \u201cOther Transfer Taxes,\u201d or \u201cOther Transfer Fees and Taxes,\u201d or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term \u201cOther Fees and Taxes.\u201d The terms set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.",
        "88":"Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. See 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.",
        "89":"As noted above, this cancellation language may be amended to the extent \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies.",
        "73":"The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. See 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).",
        "84":"As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.",
        "67":"The term \u201cState\u201d is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).",
        "82":"See also EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient \u201cshall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act\u201d).",
        "83":"The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. See TX Admin. Code \u00a7 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under \u00a7 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.",
        "80":"See 76 FR 29923.",
        "81":"See \u00a7 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. See \u00a7 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).",
        "85":"See also \u00a7 1005.30(a), which defines the term \u201cagent\u201d for purposes of the rule.",
        "87":"Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.",
        "79":"A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.",
        "78":"As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis."
