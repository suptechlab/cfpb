Because the definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d) of Regulation E applies only to financial institutions and includes inapt commentary, the Board proposed an alternative definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d applicable to remittance transfer providers. The proposed rule stated that \u201cbusiness day\u201d means any day on which a remittance transfer provider accepts funds for sending remittance transfers.",

In particular, financial institution commenters expressed concern that the date on which an institution \u201caccepts funds\u201d is unclear, because it could be interpreted either as the date on which funds are deposited into an account, or when the institution accepts a sender's order to transfer funds. Other commenters suggested replacing the proposed definition with a definition closer to the definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d) Regulation E. Upon further review, and for greater consistency among definitions, the Bureau is adopting a revised \u201cbusiness day\u201d definition in renumbered \u00a7 1005.30(b) as explained in related commentary that more closely tracks the general definition of \u201cbusiness day\u201d in \u00a7 1005.2(d), but that is tailored to the particular aspects of remittance transfers.",

Similar to proposed comment 30(b)-1, final comment 30(b)-1 clarifies that with respect to subpart B, a business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given under any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. However, comment 30(b)-1 states that a remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.",

For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard for subpart B for purposes of determining the number of days for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.",
                "Comment 30(b)-3 clarifies that a provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day. Finally, comment 30(b)-4 states that if a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the \u201csubstantially all business functions\u201d standard."

In particular, \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) creates a new exception to the definition of error in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that applies when a sender provides an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, and the conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h) are met.  Based on comments received regarding these proposed changes, and, in particular, concerning the specific mistakes by a sender that might result in an error under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it would be useful to provide further clarity on how the designated recipient is determined for purposes of determining whether an error has occurred or the new exception under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) applies.  In particular, the Bureau believes it necessary to address situations in which the transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient named by the sender at the time of the transfer.  Therefore, the Bureau is clarifying in comment 30(c)-1 that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii)."

Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a de minimis exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (i.e., 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).",
                        "The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term \u201cnormal course of business\u201d covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.",

For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).\n          See 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17).

Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing \u201cnormal course of business.\u201d Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.",

The statutory definition of \u201csender,\u201d and thus the definition in \u00a7 1005.30(g), does not turn on a consumer's residency; rather, the definition only requires that there be a consumer in a State requesting a remittance transfer. As with the definition of \u201cdesignated recipient,\u201d the Bureau believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account as a proxy for the location of the sender will create a bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule and ease compliance burden. Thus, as discussed above, under the final rule, for remittance transfers from an account, providers must look to the location of the account to determine whether there is a sender, and not the residency of the consumer requesting the transfer. Accordingly, final comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that the provider should make its determination notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3."

                "As discussed in detail below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1005.31, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and to include such fees in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient.  In order to differentiate between fees that must be disclosed and included in the calculation of the amount to be received and those that are no longer required to be disclosed and included in such calculation, the Bureau is adopting definitions under \u00a7 1005.30(h) for covered third-party fees, required to be calculated and disclosed under subpart B of Regulation E, and non-covered third-party fees, which are not required to be calculated and disclosed.  Section 1005.30(h)(1) defines the term \u201ccovered third-party fees\u201d to mean any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, except for non-covered third-party fees as described in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2).  Section 1005.30(h)(2) defines the term \u201cnon-covered third-party fees\u201d to mean any fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, except if the institution acts as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  The rationale underlying the distinctions made in these definitions is discussed further below in the discussion of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).",
                "The 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to 30(h) to explain the scope of these fees.  Drawing from applicable examples of fees imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that were in comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii in the 2012 Final Rule, as well as proposed comments 31(b)(1)-iii and -iv which would have provided additional clarification on how to disclose recipient institution fees, comment 30(h)-1 explains that fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer.",
                "Comment 30(h)-1 additionally provides examples of fees that are or are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  Comment 30(h)-1 further states that account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Comment 30(h)-1 additionally clarifies that fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. Comment 30(h)-1 also clarifies that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself.",
                "In addition, the 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to explain the difference between covered and non-covered third-party fees.  Comment 30(h)-2.i explains that under \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider including fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account where such institution acts as an agent of the provider for the remittance transfer.  As noted above, the rationale for this distinction is discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Comment 30(h)-2.ii provides examples of covered third-party fees including fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer and fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.",
                "With respect to non-covered third-party fees, comment 30(h)-3 explains that a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, unless the institution is acting as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  It further provides as an example that a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer could be a non-covered third-party fee provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the provider.  In addition, comment 30(h)-3 explains that designated recipient's account in \u00a7 1005.30(h)(2) refers only to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution.  It does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.  The rationale for this interpretation is also discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi)."

In the 2012 Final Rule under \u00a7 1005.31, the Bureau set forth the disclosure requirements for providers, including that providers disclose fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider.  Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(4)(A), the Bureau adopted an exception in \u00a7 1005.32(a) to provide that for certain disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received.",
                "As noted in the December Proposal, after the Bureau issued the February Final Rule, industry participants continued to express concerns previously raised in response to the Board's proposed rule to implement EFTA section 919.  The concerns regarded the feasibility of disclosing fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution.",
                "For the subset of transfers sent over the open network, industry participants stated that where a designated recipient's institution charges that recipient fees for receiving a transfer into an account, the remittance transfer provider would not typically know whether the recipient had agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient had agreed to pay.  Some industry participants also requested guidance on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.",
                "Separately, after the release of the February 2012 Rule, industry expressed concern about the disclosure of foreign taxes.  Industry participants argued first that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes, i.e., taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, and other local governments than it is to research and disclose those taxes imposed by a country's central government because there are substantially more jurisdictions that could impose these subnational taxes.  Second, industry participants suggested that the guidance in the 2012 Final Rule under comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2, which would allow remittance transfer providers to rely on senders' representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider is insufficient where variables that influence the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.",
                "With respect to both recipient institution fees and foreign taxes, industry stated that, to make the appropriate calculations and disclosures, remittance transfer providers might need to ask numerous questions of senders that senders might not understand or might not be able to answer.  With respect to fees, industry also stated that the calculations required to determine and disclose fees might vary with respect to each recipient institution because each of these institutions might have unique fee schedules that applied to particular accounts or different ways of imposing fees on remittance transfers.",
                "In response to these comments, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide additional flexibility and guidance regarding the calculation and disclosure of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account and taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.  The Bureau also proposed to eliminate the requirement to disclose regional, provincial, state, and other local foreign taxes and to include this amount in the disclosed amount received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau sought comment on whether these proposed changes achieved the goals stated in the December Proposal, or whether the existing rules or another alternative were preferable.",
                "The majority of comments on the proposed changes regarding recipient institution fee and tax disclosures came from industry participants, including large banks, community banks, credit unions, non-depository institutions, and trade associations.  These commenters stated that they appreciated the Bureau's attempts to facilitate compliance, particularly with respect to the proposal to eliminate the required disclosure of subnational taxes.  However, many industry commenters argued that the proposed changes did not go far enough to ease compliance burden.  These industry commenters asserted that the proposed flexibility would not effectively mitigate the difficulty of researching the information needed to provide the recipient institution fee and foreign tax disclosures to senders.  Further, these industry commenters also expressed concern that the proposed estimation methods could increase consumer confusion due to discrepancies in the estimated amounts disclosed.  Moreover, industry commenters expressed concern that, under the estimation methods described in the December Proposal, the sender would usually receive a disclosure that showed the highest possible fee or tax that could apply.  As a result of this proposed highest estimation method, commenters stated that the disclosure could result in senders increasing the amount of money transferred more than was necessary to insure that a recipient received the expected amount.",
                "Some consumer groups also expressed skepticism about the proposed estimation methods for a different reason: they believed that any additional estimation, beyond that permitted in the 2012 Final Rule, would be detrimental to senders because they would not know the precise amount of the transfer that would be received.  In contrast, other consumer groups supported the December Proposal and stated that it struck the proper balance of facilitating compliance, while also providing meaningful information to senders.",
                "The Bureau has carefully weighed these concerns and, for the reasons explained in detail below, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to include certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  For the same reasons, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose these amounts under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  However, as noted above, the Bureau believes that a majority of remittance transfers are sent through closed networks whereby the recipient picks up the transfer from an agent.  In these cases, all fees imposed on the remittance transfer would continue to be required to be disclosed. See \u00a7 1005.30(h)(1).",
                "For those minority of transfers where there may be non-covered third-party fees, the 2013 Final Rule requires that remittance transfer providers include, as applicable, a disclaimer on the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, or combined disclosure, indicating that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank. See \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  Similarly, if there may be taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the 2013 Final Rule requires that providers include a disclaimer indicating that the recipient may receive less due to foreign taxes.  As part of these disclaimers, providers may choose to disclose an exact or estimated amount of these fees or taxes. See \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3).",
                "As described in detail below, the 2013 Final Rule's Appendix and Model Forms have been amended to include samples of the new disclosures and disclaimers.  The Bureau is also making conforming edits in several other provisions in \u00a7 1005.31 to reflect the changes in the required disclosures.  These changes are described below."

                        "As is explained in detail below, as part of the changes adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, the Bureau is adding two optional disclosures. First, the Bureau is making optional the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. See \u00a7\u20091005.33(b)(1)(viii). Second, the Bureau is creating an exception to the definition of error for certain mistakes made by senders. See \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D). If a provider wants to take advantage of this exception, it must provide a notice before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer consistent with \u00a7\u20091005.33(h)(3). While these two disclosures are optional, the Bureau believes it is important to ensure that they are made in a manner that is clear and conspicuous. Thus, the Bureau is amending \u00a7\u20091005.31(a)(1) to state that disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E or permitted by \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) or \u00a7\u20091005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous.

Since the Board's initial proposal, commenters have argued that because a tax is imposed by a government, and not by the provider, this provision may be confusing.

                        "Since the Board first proposed to amend Regulation E to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's remittance transfer provisions, industry participants and representatives have argued that particularly for remittance transfers that take place over an open network, the requirement to disclose third-party fees is unduly burdensome, if not impossible, given the potential number of institutions involved in any one transfer and the fact that remittance transfer providers typically have no direct relationships with recipient institutions. In issuing the February Final Rule, the Bureau recognized the challenges for providers in disclosing fees imposed by third parties, but determined that the disclosure of third-party fees would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer consistent with the purposes of the EFTA.",
                        "Consequently, \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule required providers to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the provider (including fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution) and required that such fees be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). In view of Congress' recognition that these determinations would be difficult in the context of open network transactions by financial institutions, see EFTA section 919(a)(4), \u00a7\u20091005.32(a) permitted insured institutions to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii) for an interim period when such transfers are sent from a sender's account with the institution and the remittance transfer cannot determine the exact amounts for reasons beyond its control.",
                        "As noted above, after the Bureau published the February Final Rule, industry participants and representatives continued to express concern through comment letters and other fora that, where a designated recipient's institution charges the recipient fees for receiving a transfer in an account, the remittance transfer provider would not reasonably know, or be able to estimate, the amount of fees that might apply because fees might vary based on agreements between the recipient and the recipient institution. Relatedly, industry participants and representatives requested clarification on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, the account type, the quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.",
                        "In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide clarification relating to which recipient institution fees remittance transfer providers were required to disclose and additional flexibility and guidance on how recipient institution fees could be disclosed. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have provided additional examples to distinguish between fees that are specifically related to the remittance transfer and therefore required to be disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), including fees that are imposed by a recipient's institution for receiving a wire transfer, and other types of recipient institution fees that are not specifically related to a remittance transfer, such as a monthly maintenance fee, and therefore not required to be disclosed. For example, the proposed comment would have noted that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. Moreover, similar to the treatment of taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau proposed to add comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-4 to clarify that a provider could rely on a sender's representation regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account where the provider did not have specific knowledge regarding such variables.",
                        "Additionally, the December Proposal proposed to allow all remittance transfer providers, not just insured institutions covered by the temporary exception, the flexibility to estimate on a permanent basis certain fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account. Specially, where a provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(4)(i) would have permitted a provider to disclose the highest possible recipient institution fees that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable, as determined based on either the recipient institution's fee schedules or information ascertained from prior transfers to that same institution.",
                        "The December Proposal additionally provided in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(4)(ii) and its accompanying commentary that, if the remittance transfer provider could not obtain such fee schedules or did not have such information, the provider could rely on other reasonable sources of information, including fee schedules published by competitor institutions, surveys of financial institution fees, or information provided by the recipient institution's regulator or central bank as long as the provider disclosed the highest fees identified through the relied-upon source. The Bureau sought comment on all aspects of this proposal.",
                        "Although most industry commenters stated that they supported the Bureau's efforts to provide additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine applicable recipient institution fees, many industry commenters argued that the December Proposal would not significantly reduce the burden of disclosing recipient institution fees that are not already known. Describing providers' efforts to come into compliance with the 2012 Final Rule, industry commenters stated that efforts to obtain fee information had largely been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining information from recipient institutions with whom providers had no direct relationship, particularly in cases in which fees were governed by contracts between recipient institutions and recipients, i.e., those institutions' customers. In additional outreach by the Bureau, one large bank provider and correspondent reported that it had attempted to survey recipient institutions with which it had regular contact, but that the vast majority of institutions had either not provided the requested fee information or failed to respond altogether. In comment letters, as well as outreach both before and after the publication of the December Proposal, industry participants stated that they had difficulty explaining to foreign institutions what was being requested and why the foreign institutions should provide that information. Industry participants further stated that recipient institutions declined to provide the requested fee information, citing proprietary, competitive, and privacy concerns associated with releasing information about their fee schedules and their contractual relationships with their customers.",
                        "Some industry participants stated that as a result of the difficulty in obtaining fee information from individual institutions, even with the flexibility that the December Proposal would have allowed, they anticipated that the challenges associated with obtaining fee schedules or conducting fee surveys might force them to limit services to countries where fee information was more readily obtainable or where the transfer volume was significant enough to warrant additional efforts to obtain fee information. Though the pertinent comment letters focused on the December Proposal, the arguments echoed concerns that industry participants had previously expressed prior to the 2012 Final Rule with regard to any requirement to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider. Industry commenters further opined more generally, as they had prior to the 2012 Final Rule, that a significant number of providers might choose to exit the market altogether, even if the Bureau were to adopt the December Proposal, due to the difficulty of disclosing recipient institution fees.",
                        "In addition, several industry commenters stated that compared to the 2012 Final Rule, the proposed estimation methodologies would not improve and instead could diminish the quality of the disclosures received by senders or senders' ability to comparison shop. With respect to the Bureau's proposal to add commentary clarifying that remittance transfer providers could rely in certain circumstances on senders' representations regarding the variables that affect the amount of fees to be imposed by a recipient's financial institution (see proposed \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(4)), several industry commenters argued that if the sender knew the fees that applied to the recipient's account, then it is likely the sender was getting such information from the recipient, and in such cases the disclosure of recipient institution fees would not provide additional transparency to the sender. By contrast, to the extent that the sender had not received information on the variables that affect fees from the designated recipient, industry commenters argued that relying on a sender's representation would be unlikely to provide reliable information. Industry commenters repeated industry's longstanding assertion that recipients are in the best position to know what fees their institutions impose on receiving transfers, and suggested that the Bureau reconsider its decision to mandate disclosure of such fees or provide a database of fees upon which providers could rely.",
                        "Many industry commenters also expressed concern with respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers to disclose an estimate of the highest possible recipient institution fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable (see proposed \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(4)), as determined based on either fee schedules made available by the recipient institution or information ascertained from prior transfers to the same recipient institution. Commenters stated that if each provider employed its own methodology based on its own research, the highest possible fee estimates would vary, sometimes widely, across institutions. Commenters argued that this could cause consumer confusion and undermine comparison shopping, as senders would have little insight into which estimation model was accurate. Although certain limited estimation is permitted under the 2012 Final Rule for some transfers sent by insured institutions, see \u00a7\u20091005.32(a) and (b), commenters argued that using the additional estimation methodologies permitted under the December Proposal would lead to greater degrees of inaccuracy because of the requirement to disclose the highest estimate possible with respect to certain recipient institution fees where such fees might be unlikely apply. Furthermore, the proposed estimation methodology would have differed from the bases for estimates described in existing \u00a7\u20091005.32(c), which permit a provider to base an estimate on an approach not listed in subpart B of Regulation E so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the provider disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii).",
                        "Commenters also suggested that under either the 2012 Final Rule or the December Proposal, smaller institutions would be at a disadvantage, compared to their larger competitors, because they would have fewer resources to collect and maintain extensive data sets regarding account fees for every location to which they did or could send a remittance transfer. Several industry commenters further opined that remittance transfer providers that could provide lower estimates could have a competitive advantage over providers that provided higher (but potentially more accurate) estimates because the providers with lower estimates would appear to be providing designated recipients with more funds, even though the actual fee imposed by the recipient institution for the same designated recipient should generally be the same for transfers sent by the same sender to the same recipient institution.",
                        "Finally, some industry commenters argued there was a significant risk that if the highest possible fee a recipient institution could impose on receiving a remittance transfer was disclosed, a sender might unnecessarily overfund a remittance transfer to ensure that the designated recipient received a certain amount. For example, a commenter explained, that a sender might want to send a remittance transfer to a merchant to pay for a purchase. The merchant, per its agreement with the receiving institution, might be charged an incoming wire transfer fee. Although the merchant would not expect the sender to pay this fee, as the merchant had incorporated such cost into its overhead, the sender might believe that he or she is responsible for covering this fee and might increase the amount transferred by the amount of the disclosed fee.",
                        "Because of the limitations they perceived with estimates disclosed under the Bureau's methodology described in the December Proposal, the majority of industry commenters requested that the Bureau eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees altogether. Several of these industry commenters argued, as commenters had argued as part of the 2012 rulemakings, that section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not expressly require disclosure of recipient institution fees and urged the Bureau to eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees. A few commenters went further and suggested that the Bureau should eliminate the required disclosure of intermediary fees as well. Alternatively, industry commenters suggested that the Bureau delay the implementation date for the disclosure of recipient institution fees until resources for ascertaining such fees could be developed, although such commenters did not indicate that such resources were being developed or that they would soon be available.",
                        "Consumer group commenters were divided in their reactions to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees. Although some consumer group commenters favored the Bureau's approach in providing increased flexibility and guidance with respect to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, other consumer group commenters believed that the methods of estimation proposed by the Bureau would prove to be problematic for senders and suggested either that the allowance for such estimation be made temporary or that the required disclosure of recipient institution fees be eliminated.",
                        "Among consumer group commenters who favored the disclosure of recipient institution fees, some opined that recipient institution fee information could become readily available given current technology, and they encouraged the Bureau to, at the very least, make any additional estimate provisions temporary in nature. This would, these commenters argued, provide strong incentives to industry to create databases with the necessary information for compliance. In addition, one comment letter argued that permitting \u201cestimated\u201d price disclosures essentially permits a continuation of the status quo that Congress intended to change by adopting section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The commenter further suggested that although a permanent exemption from any disclosure requirements would be premature, a delay in requiring disclosure of recipient institution fees may be needed to provide enough time and the proper incentives for some providers to update their information systems in order to capture this information.",
                        "By contrast, other consumer group commenters maintained that it was appropriate to eliminate the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees given the difficulty remittance transfer providers (or their partners) face in determining these fees. These commenters argued that, given the inaccuracies inherent in estimating the applicable fees to be applied, senders would be better served by an alternative generic disclosure noting that recipient institutions may charge account fees, rather than requiring the specific disclosure of such fees.",
                        "In light of information received through comment letters, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper both to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to disclose recipient institution fees for transfers into an account, except where the recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider.",
                        "As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these fees, helping to decide how much money to send, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution. As described in the February Final Rule, in recent years, a number of concerns with regard to the clarity and reliability of information provided to consumers sending remittance transfers have been identified. Congressional hearings prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act focused on the need for standardized and reliable pre-payment disclosures, suggesting that disclosure of the amount of money to be received by the designated recipient is particularly critical. Research suggests that consumers place a high value on reliability to ensure that the promised amount is made available to recipients. See 77 FR 6199 (and sources cited therein).",
                        "Despite the public interest in the disclosure of recipient interest fees, however, the Bureau believes that requiring disclosure of such fees in cases in which the recipient institution is not an agent of the provider would at this time either require a substantial delay in implementation of the overall Dodd-Frank Act regime for remittance transfers or produce a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors. The Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, the Bureau has constructed the exception to relieve the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees absent an agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution.",
                        "The Bureau believes that, in practice, this adjustment of the 2012 Final Rule will affect a minority of remittance transfers. While information on the volume of open-network transfers is limited, the Bureau believes that closed network transfers sent through agents\u2014i.e., transfers for which remittance transfer providers must continue to disclose all third-party fees in accordance with the 2012 Final Rule\u2014account for the majority of remittance transfers.",
                        "For the minority of transfers where the exception applies because there is no agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution, the Bureau has concluded that finalizing the proposed exception in \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(4) (which would have permitted estimates in certain circumstances) would have significant risks and disadvantages to senders of remittance transfers. First, despite the greater flexibility that the December Proposal would have provided concerning estimation methodologies, the Bureau is concerned that many remittance transfer providers still would have curtailed services particularly outside of heavily used corridors. Second, the Bureau is concerned that the resulting estimates would have varied so widely that their use to consumers in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited.",
                        "The Bureau believes that given current limitations, it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to warn consumers where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided. The Bureau also believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, and will continue dialogue with interested stakeholders about how best to make progress toward this goal.",
                        "The Bureau's conclusion rests in large part on its understanding of the open network systems for sending remittance transfers. As described above, these networks allow remittance transfer providers to send to accounts at banks worldwide. However, providers have limited authority or ability to monitor or control the recipient institutions in such networks. Although the Bureau had expected that industry's implementation efforts would result in the development of the compilation of reliable and current information concerning fees imposed by many recipient institutions for most corridors, the process has been slower and harder than expected and the lack of comprehensive information could lead providers to limit their offerings. Given the current environment, the Bureau believes that estimating, or in some cases, determining the actual recipient institution fees for transfers to accounts consistent with the 2012 Final Rule would be difficult or impracticable given the myriad institutions to which such remittance transfers may be sent and the myriad fee schedules that may apply across these institutions.",
                        "Even under the Bureau's proposal to provide additional flexibility for remittance transfer providers in estimating certain recipient institution Start Printed Page 30673fees for transfers to accounts, the comment letters and the Bureau's outreach suggest that the burden of obtaining and maintaining applicable fee information sufficient to provide the permitted estimates in all cases would still be substantial. The Bureau is concerned that even if it adopted the December Proposal, the requirements to disclose recipient institution fees might cause a number of providers to raise their prices, significantly reduce their offerings, or exit the market due to the requirements related to the disclosure of recipient institution fees. If any price increase were similar to the size of a recipient institution fee, that alone might offset the benefit of improved information about the size of such fees. Furthermore, as the Bureau stated in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that the loss of market participants would be detrimental to senders by decreasing market competition and the convenient availability of remittance transfer services.",
                        "Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that the estimate methodologies proposed in the December Proposal would have produced disclosures that varied so widely that their use to senders in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited. In many cases, the December Proposal would have required the remittance transfer provider to over-estimate recipient institution fees, by disclosing the highest possible fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable. To the extent providers used differing methodologies upon which to base their estimates, the disclosed fees could vary significantly across institutions, making it difficult for senders to decide how much money to transmit.",
                        "In addition, because these fees would be separately disclosed and included within the total to recipient on the disclosure forms, differences in amounts disclosed among remittance transfer providers could lead senders to mistakenly focus on discrepancies within these fees when comparison shopping, even though the actual fee would likely be the same regardless of the provider so long as the sender transmitted the same amount to the same designated recipient at the same institution using the same transfer method. While the Bureau believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, the Bureau has concluded that given current limitations it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to alert senders where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided. By providing the disclaimer, senders themselves can investigate such fees. In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii), providers may be incentivized to seek such information to better compete with providers providing more detailed price information. The Bureau believes this amendment to the disclosure requirements will best preserve senders' access to competitive remittance transfer markets, while facilitating continued information-gathering about such fees both by senders and providers.",
                        "Alternatively, the Bureau considered further delaying implementation of the section 1073 protections, to allow remittance transfer providers to continue to seek more reliable fee information in order to reduce implementation burdens and make fee-related disclosures more accurate and thus more useful for senders. However, the Bureau believes that it is critical to provide senders timely access to the important new consumer protection benefits of the 2012 Final Rule including rights to cancellation and error resolution.",
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau has tailored its amendments to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), and as discussed below, \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii), to focus on the third-party fees that the Bureau believes are most difficult for remittance transfer providers to disclose. Based on the Bureau's outreach, it appears that providers sending transfers through open network systems have had considerably more success in obtaining information needed to estimate or disclose accurately fees imposed by intermediary institutions, as compared to recipient institutions that maintain ongoing customer relationships with individual designated recipients. Some providers (or business partners) have changed or contemplated changing the methods they use to send transfers between bank accounts, in order to avoid the imposition of any intermediary fees. In addition, some providers have worked with correspondents to understand such intermediary fees. Thus, the Bureau is not eliminating the requirement to disclose pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) intermediary bank fees or to include such amount in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii).",
                        "Similarly, although the Bureau is making an adjustment for recipient institution fees that it believes industry cannot reasonably disclose, it is not adjusting the required disclosures for transfers that a recipient picks up at a paying agent. As noted above, the additional guidance included in the December Proposal targeted situations in which providers did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account. By contrast, where the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes the provider should have access to or be able to contract concerning the disclosure of any fees imposed by such institution. Consequently, the Bureau is maintaining the provider's obligation under the 2012 Final Rule to disclose a designated recipient institution's fees where such recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider in the remittance transfer. Through a provider's contractual arrangements with its agents, the Bureau believes that such information should be readily available to or obtainable by a provider or that the provider can control such fees, based on the terms of the contract between the provider and such agent.",
                        "For similar reasons, the Bureau is maintaining the requirement to disclose fees assessed for remittance transfers to credit cards, prepaid cards, or virtual accounts held by an Internet-based or mobile phone company that is not a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution. See comment 30(h)-3. In the December Proposal, the Bureau did not specifically propose to allow estimation of these amounts. Although a few comment letters suggested that the proposed estimates exception should be expanded to cover more than depository institution accounts, such as general purpose reloadable (or prepaid) cards, mobile phones, or mobile or electronic wallets, no commenters suggested that obtaining this information would be as burdensome as the disclosure of depository institution fees. Indeed, upon further outreach, industry participants largely confirmed that currently the majority of such transactions currently take place within a single network whereby such fees are a matter of contract. The Bureau believes that the systems for offering such transfers are still nascent and that currently most of these transfers are provided through systems in which remittance transfer providers have contractual arrangements with the recipient institutions, or the providers and the recipient institutions operate within one single network. The Bureau further believes that these arrangements Start Printed Page 30674will likely permit providers to exercise some control over, or learn about, fees charged by recipient institutions. As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers, and any associated networks, can design systems so that any associated fees with respect to such transfers are transparent to providers and senders alike.",
                        "The Bureau does not believe that the same sort of evolution can happen as quickly or easily in existing open network systems, and in particular for the interbank wire transfer system. These systems use communication and settlement protocols that have been developed over decades (or longer) and assume that participating institutions will exercise little control over each other.[6] Furthermore, these systems depend on the participation of many foreign entities that have no duty or incentive to comply with subpart B of Regulation E. Consequently, for purposes of determining the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account under \u00a7\u20091005.30(h)(2), the Bureau includes transfers into an asset account, regardless of whether or not it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. See comment 30(h)-3. The Bureau believes that these institutions are likely subject to legacy systems that cannot easily be modified to capture fee information.",
                        "In light of these conclusions, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau is exercising its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to maintain in \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) the remittance transfer provider's obligation to disclose covered third-party fees and that such fees be included in the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), discussed further below. The Bureau believes that providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of such fees, and separately disclosing these fees, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer.",
                        "Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the required disclosure of non-covered third-party fees, the Bureau is also not adopting the suggestion of several industry and consumer group commenters that to facilitate compliance, the Bureau help develop and maintain a database of recipient institution fees that could be accessed by remittance transfer providers. The Bureau continues to believe that because providers are engaged in the business of sending remittance transfers and likely will develop relationships with recipient institutions over time, providers are in a better position than the Bureau is to determine applicable fee information. The Bureau will continue to monitor implementation of this rule and market developments, including whether better information about recipient institution fees becomes more readily available over time. The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of actual fees over time."

                        "Commenters' arguments regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes have largely paralleled their arguments regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees. Notably, since the Board's proposal, industry has argued that the requirement to disclose foreign taxes is unduly burdensome given the number of jurisdictions that may impose taxes and the challenges of determining whether or how various tax exceptions or exclusions may apply. Although the Bureau recognized the challenges for remittance transfer providers in disclosing foreign taxes, the Bureau also believed that this disclosure would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer, which the Bureau believed was consistent with the purposes of the EFTA. Consequently, \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule generally would have required that providers disclose foreign taxes and take such taxes into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). This disclosure of taxes would have included foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, as well as taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, or other local governments.",
                        "After the Bureau published the 2012 Final Rule, industry continued to express concern about the ability of remittance transfer providers to disclose these foreign taxes in two respects. First, industry argued that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes than to research and disclose only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, with little commensurate benefit to consumers. Second, industry suggested that the existing guidance on the disclosure of foreign taxes is insufficient where variables that influence the applicability of foreign taxes are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.",
                        "In light of these comments, in its December Proposal, the Bureau proposed two revisions to the 2012 Final Rule regarding foreign tax disclosures. First, the proposal would have revised \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) to state that only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government on the remittance transfer need to be disclosed. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-3 would have further clarified that regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes do not need to be disclosed, although the remittance transfer provider could choose to disclose them. In the event that the subnational taxes were not disclosed, the proposal would have required that a provider state that a disclosure is \u201cEstimated.\u201d Consistent with this amendment, regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes would not have needed to be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii).",
                        "Second, the December Proposal also would have provided additional flexibility regarding the determination of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government. Under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), if a remittance transfer provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of these taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider could disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable. Where a provider relied on this estimation method, the proposal would have required that a provider state that related disclosures are \u201cEstimated.\u201d",
                        "The Bureau sought comment on both aspects of these proposed changes, including whether the proposed revisions would facilitate compliance and how the revisions would impact senders. Similar to comments about the proposed revisions to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, the Bureau received numerous comments from industry and consumer groups on its proposed elimination of the subnational tax disclosure and also its proposed methods for the estimation of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government.",
                        "With respect to the proposed change related to the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes and to include such taxes in the calculation of the amount to be received, there was uniform support from industry commenters. Nearly all industry commenters expressed concern that it was infeasible to attempt to research all potential jurisdictions that might impose a subnational tax. Further, industry commenters noted that there would be an ongoing and potentially significant cost required to maintain information related to all subnational tax laws throughout the world given the number of potential jurisdictions that could impose a tax. Additionally, in terms of the feasibility of the disclosure of subnational taxes, one money transmitter also stated that it would be difficult for it to disclose subnational taxes given that its customers were not required, when sending a transfer, to specify a sub-region within a country where the transfer would be picked up.",
                        "Another money transmitter also stated that, in its experience, it believed that subnational taxes were rare. Although this commenter did not cite any examples of tax practice in specific jurisdictions, this commenter argued that many localities wanted to encourage the inflow of transfers, and therefore, would be unlikely to impose subnational taxes. This commenter and others stated that the cost to determine, in every case, whether subnational taxes applied, a cost that might be passed on to all senders, would outweigh the benefits given that it appeared that such taxes rarely applied in practice.",
                        "In contrast to the uniform support by industry commenters for the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer group commenters were divided regarding their views about the proposed elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes. Some consumer group commenters opposed the proposed change and stated that full disclosure of the exact amount of foreign taxes was critical in order for senders to be aware of exactly how much money would be received. They stated that elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes would harm senders because they would not know with certainty how much money would ultimately be received. Other consumer group commenters, however, stated that the burden of researching and disclosing subnational taxes outweighed the relative benefit to senders. These consumer group commenters noted that some remittance transfer providers could withdraw from the market or increase prices if required to research and disclose subnational taxes.",
                        "With respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers increased flexibility to estimate the taxes imposed by a country's central government, many industry commenters expressed concern that the December Proposal did not sufficiently ease the burden of researching foreign taxes. These industry commenters raised several concerns with respect to the proposed estimated disclosure of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government. Some industry participants commented that they did not have the capability to research the relevant tax laws in the first place because they did not have foreign contacts, or, alternatively, that they did not have the resources to expend to determine the applicable foreign tax laws. Thus, they asserted that an ability to estimate would not facilitate compliance since such estimation would require an underlying knowledge of the foreign tax laws.",
                        "Industry commenters, particularly smaller banks and credit unions, also noted that remittance transfer providers were reluctant to rely on information from third-party service providers (such as larger correspondent institutions) because they would have no means to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the third-parties. Further, even where the tax information was accurate, some industry commenters stated that there could be a high cost associated with relying on a third-party provider to obtain that foreign tax information. Similar to industry comments about the disclosure of subnational taxes, commenters stated that these costs not only included the upfront costs of acquiring the tax information but also ongoing costs required to maintain and update tax information. For example, commenters expressed concern that, even if a provider (or a third-party selling the tax information) determined that a particular country did not tax remittance transfers, the provider would need to continue to monitor that country's tax law to know whether any new tax laws were enacted in the future.",
                        "Industry commenters (as well as some consumer group commenters) stated that some of the burden resulting from the disclosure of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government could be solved if the Bureau itself developed a tax database that was made available to remittance transfer providers. Industry commenters noted that a Bureau-provided database would eliminate the cost and potential inaccuracy that could result from each provider's individual attempts to determine the applicable foreign taxes.",
                        "Along similar lines, the Bureau learned through outreach that at least one trade association is developing a database containing information about foreign taxes imposed on remittance transfers by a country's central government. The trade association informed the Bureau that, by working with a third-party, it thought it could eventually determine the relevant tax laws for most countries. The trade association, however, stated that there were several challenges associated with determining and disclosing the applicable tax under the proposed estimation method. According to the trade association and other commenters, one concern was that many foreign taxes have exceptions and exclusions that are not imposed uniformly on all transfers. The trade association noted that, even if a database listed applicable tax laws, it might be difficult for remittance transfer providers, particularly smaller providers, to apply these exceptions and incorporate the exceptions into computer programs or onto forms to arrive at an accurate tax disclosure. Some industry commenters also noted that, if a provider did not apply an exception, that provider might appear to be imposing a higher tax than another provider that applied the exception, even if the tax is the same. Thus, these commenters stated that a sender might misidentify the cheapest provider.",
                        "Relatedly, several other industry commenters expressed concern that a tax law might be misinterpreted or misunderstood by the remittance transfer provider because of the challenges of interpreting foreign laws. As a result, several industry commenters and a trade association stated that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for providers that use some reasonable processes to acquire the tax information. Other commenters stated that they would favor a safe harbor whereby, if the provider relied on some reasonable source of information in obtaining tax information, that provider would not be liable if the disclosed tax was incorrect.",
                        "Industry commenters also echoed similar comments to those made with respect to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the recipient institution fee disclosures, stating that the estimated tax disclosure would be of limited benefit to senders because they believed that in many instances the same tax likely would apply to all transfers to a particular country. As a result, a disclosure of the foreign tax would not improve a sender's ability to comparison shop among remittance transfer providers. In addition, other commenters noted that because the Bureau's proposed estimation method required a disclosure of the highest possible foreign tax that could be imposed with respect to any unknown variable, a sender might transfer more money than was required to compensate for the high estimated tax that the sender believed would be deducted. The commenters noted, for example, that if a sender was transferring funds to a foreign merchant, the higher disclosed tax could harm the sender who inadvertently provided more money than was necessary to pay for a good or service.",
                        "In contrast to industry commenters and as with respect to the Bureau's proposal to eliminate the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer groups were divided with respect to their comments about the proposed change to allow estimation to be used in the determination of the foreign country tax disclosure. Some consumer groups stated that the estimation of foreign taxes would harm senders because they would not know exactly how much money would be received. In contrast, other consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposed estimation method for those taxes imposed by a country's central government. These consumer groups stated that the Bureau's proposed estimation method would facilitate compliance, and thereby encourage providers to stay in the market or prevent providers from increasing prices.",
                        "Similar to its reasoning with respect to the elimination of the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, as a result of comments received, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper both to further the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers include taxes collected by a person other than the provider\u2014including both subnational taxes and taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, in the calculation of the amount to be disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). Consistent with this revision, the Bureau is also eliminating the requirement to disclose taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi) since such taxes are no longer necessary to clarify the calculation of the amount to be received under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). Under the 2013 Final Rule, a provider continues to be required to disclose any taxes collected by the provider, as described under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(ii), but providers are no longer required to disclose taxes collected by other persons.",
                        "As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these taxes on the total amount transferred, deciding how much money to transfer, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution. Yet, while this foreign tax information is important for consumers, the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of taxes collected by a person other than the provider could at this time produce increased costs for all transactions or result in a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors. Similar to its decision about eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, the Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, the Bureau has concluded that in the current environment, this amendment to the tax disclosure requirements will best preserve access to competitive prices for remittance transfers for a wide range of countries.",
                        "As with fees, one key factor in the Bureau's decision was a concern that the required tax disclosure might limit the availability of remittance services to certain countries or result in an increased cost for many transfers. With respect to cost increases, under the 2012 Final Rule and the December Proposal, most remittance transfer providers would have needed to conduct research to determine (or purchase information regarding) the relevant foreign tax laws, potentially for many countries. These providers would also need to expend resources to update this information on a regular basis. Although one industry association has been undertaken to develop a database of applicable central government taxes, that association acknowledged several challenges both in developing the database and with how individual providers would make use of the data contained in it. For example, validation and continuous updating of the information collected remains a substantial concern. As described above, the Bureau is concerned that many providers would pass the costs associated with these efforts on to senders in the form of increased prices that would affect remittance transfers across the board, even to countries in which no such taxes are actually imposed. The Bureau also remains concerned that the cost of maintaining the required tax information could cause providers to exit the market, or limit their offerings\u2014even if the requirement was limited to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government. Some providers, for example, might curtail their services and limit transfers only to the highest traffic corridors in order to minimize their necessary foreign tax law research. Because some providers might restrict their services to certain corridors with less volume, a sender might have limited ability to send transfers to those regions.",
                        "As a result, while the Bureau generally believes that senders can benefit from transparency regarding the foreign tax disclosure, in the present market, the cost of obtaining the necessary tax information may exceed the benefit of this information to many senders. As with recipient institution fees, the Bureau also recognizes that in many instances the benefit of the disclosure may be minimized because the actual foreign tax imposed is likely to be uniform across all remittance transfers to a particular person in a particular country (and, therefore, the same tax would apply).[7]",
                        "In addition, as with the estimation of recipient institution fees, the disclosure of the highest tax estimates based on any unknown variable, as required in the December Proposal, could result in consumer confusion where providers disclosed different tax estimates. Even if third-party providers developed common databases of information, there is still a risk of inconsistent disclosures depending on providers' knowledge of potentially relevant variables, practices, and interpretations of foreign tax law. The Bureau believes that using the general disclaimer and moving any voluntarily provided estimates or actual numbers lower on the form will help to reduce the risk that senders mistakenly choose providers based on discrepancies in tax estimates. Further, rather than adopting a systematic rule that tends to overestimate tax rates, the Bureau believes that senders may prefer to apply different approaches to different types of transfers, for instance by being more conservative about the risk of overfunding a transfer to a business as compared to a family member.",
                        "The Bureau also does not believe that it is appropriate or feasible to create a safe harbor for remittance transfer providers that rely on a third-party database or some other third-party source for tax information. At this time, the Bureau is not aware of any data source whose accuracy it can guarantee, absent extensive monitoring. The Bureau is not currently positioned to evaluate the accuracy of each database that might be created nor can it determine whether providers are reasonably researching, interpreting, or applying the applicable foreign tax laws. Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that currently it is positioned to create a database itself. In addition, even if a database existed, as noted above, it would still be necessary to determine how the particular tax laws and exceptions or exclusions applied, and the Bureau believes that providers are better positioned to learn over time how foreign tax laws apply to individual transfers.",
                        "Overall, given the current burden of researching the foreign taxes and the potential risks of sender confusion, increased cost, and reduced transfer services, the Bureau believes that the best result at this time is to eliminate the obligation to disclose taxes collected by parties other than the remittance transfer provider and to eliminate the requirement to include this amount in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau, however, notes that its decision is based on the current feasibility and cost associated with determining or estimating such taxes imposed on a remittance transfer, as well as the potential impact on market structure and pricing practices. The Bureau intends to monitor whether the development and availability of information regarding taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider becomes more feasible in the future. The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of foreign taxes over time."

As adopted by the 2012 Final Rule, this disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received including any recipient institution fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. As stated above, the Bureau is exercising its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the amount received, consistent with the narrowed scope of \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi).

The Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient is necessary and proper to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA because the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of such amounts within the amount disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii) might hamper senders' ability to make informed comparisons across similar providers.",

Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes. These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.",
                        "Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer. Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language. The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by \u00a7\u20091005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Although new \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.",
                        "New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes. Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable. For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees. In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.",
                        "New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii). The comment also notes that \u00a7\u20091005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information.

In addition, as stated above, to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount received, disclosed on the receipt provided to the sender under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(2)(i), consistent with the narrowed scope of \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau also believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require providers to include disclaimers stating, as applicable, that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is amending the cross-reference in \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(2)(i) to require that such disclaimers be provided on the receipt. These changes would also be reflected on a combined disclosure. See \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(3)."

The 2012 Final Rule incorporates this requirement and sets forth grouping, proximity, prominence, size, and segregation requirements to ensure that it is satisfied. In particular, \u00a7\u20091005.31(c)(1) requires that information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement is to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, will be reduced by fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. As previously discussed, under the 2013 Final Rule the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is no longer required under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), or included in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii), but instead is subject to new \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii). Consequently, the 2013 Final Rule amends \u00a7\u20091005.31(c)(1) to group the new \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) disclosure requirement with the information required by \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii). The Bureau believes that this grouping will ensure that the sender will understand that the total amount received by the designated recipient will be affected by these additional fees and taxes as applicable. In addition, the Bureau clarifies that although disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by \u00a7\u20091005.31(a)(5) generally need not comply with the grouping requirements, information required or permitted by \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be grouped with \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that it is important that the new disclaimers\u2014which advise of potential additional fees and taxes\u2014be grouped with the disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient in order to maximize the likelihood that senders will see the disclaimers and read them in conjunction with the disclosures under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii).

The purpose of this proximity requirement is to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.

Section 1005.32, as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, includes only three specific exceptions to this requirement.  First, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(4), \u00a7 1005.32(a) of the 2012 Final Rule provides a temporary exception for certain transfers by insured institutions.  Second, consistent with EFTA section 919(c), \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1) provides a permanent exception for transfers to certain countries.  Third, the 2012 Final Rule also includes an exception under \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2) for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer.  Thus, a remittance transfer provider is permitted to estimate exchange rates, fees, and taxes that are required by \u00a7 1005.31 to be disclosed to the extent permitted in \u00a7 1005.32(a) and (b).  The December Proposal would have created additional exceptions to permit estimation with respect to certain recipient institution fees under proposed \u00a7 1005.32(b)(4) and national foreign taxes under proposed \u00a7 1005.32(b)(3).

Such an error may result from a sender's provision of an incorrect account or routing number to a remittance transfer provider.  Industry expressed concern after the February Final Rule was published about the remedies available when a sender provides an incorrect account number to the provider.  Providers have stated that in some cases, as a result of such errors, remittance transfers may be deposited into the wrong account and, despite reasonable efforts by the provider, cannot be recovered.  Under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule, a provider is obligated to resend to the designated recipient or refund to the sender the total amount of the remittance transfer regardless of whether it can recover the funds.  Industry has noted that this problem is of particular concern with respect to transfers of large sums, particularly for smaller institutions that might have more difficulty bearing the loss of the entire transfer amount.  In addition, providers have expressed concern that the remedy provisions of the 2012 Final Rule create a potential for fraud, despite an exception that excludes transfers with fraudulent intent from the definition of error. See \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).",
                "In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal the Bureau proposed a new exception to the definition of error in \u00a7 1005.33.  The exception set forth in proposed \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided the provider met certain specified conditions.  The Bureau also proposed several other changes to the error resolution procedures in \u00a7 1005.33 to address questions of how remittance transfer providers should provide remedies to senders for errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.",
                "Based on comments received, the Bureau is adopting the proposed exception and is further revising these procedures as detailed below.  The Bureau is also adopting conforming changes to the error resolution procedures to reflect revisions to the disclosure requirements concerning non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as well as making several technical, non-substantive changes."

The commentary to \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii) explains that this category includes situations in which the designated recipient may receive an incorrect amount of currency. See comment 33(a)-2. Insofar as the Bureau is amending \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii) to exclude from the disclosed total to be received by the designated recipient non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the Bureau has adjusted the definition of error under \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii) to reflect that change. Thus, as adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii) states that an error includes the failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vii) and stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer. Relatedly, the Bureau is adding a new exception, in \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii)(C), which states that no error under \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii) occurs if the difference results from the application of non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and the provider provided the disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii). The Bureau is also making conforming edits to \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) to allow for the addition of \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii)(C).",

In the 2013 Final Rule, the examples in comment 33(a)-3.ii are revised to reflect the changes discussed above regarding the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Comment 33(a)-3.ii, as revised, discusses as an example a situation in which the remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt stating an amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, which does not reflect the additional foreign taxes that will be collected in Colombia on the transfer but includes the disclaimer required by \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii). The comment explains that because the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt due solely to the additional foreign taxes that the provider was not required to disclose, no error has occurred. Comment 33(a)-3.iii, as revised, addresses a situation where the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider does not reflect additional fees that are imposed by the receiving agent in Colombia on the transfer. Because the designated recipient in this example will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed in the receipt due to the additional covered third-party fees, an error under \u00a7\u20091005.33(a)(1)(iii) has occurred.",
                        "The Bureau is also adding new comment 33(a)-3.vi, which provides an example of a situation where a sender requests that his bank send US$120 to a designated recipient's account at an institution in a foreign country. The foreign institution is not an agent of the provider. Only US$100 is deposited into the designated recipient's account because the recipient institution imposed a US$20 incoming wire fee and deducted the fee from the amount deposited into the designated recipient's account. Because this fee is a non-covered third-party fee that the remittance transfer provider is not required to disclose under \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(vi), no error has occurred if the provider provided the disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.31(b)(1)(viii).",

See \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term \u201cerror\u201d under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. See comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.",
                "As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.",
                "In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed \u00a7 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.",
                "The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.

They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.",
                        "Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.",
                        "Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule\u2014\u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)\u2014is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.",
                        "Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.",
                        "Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.",
                        "In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.",
                        "Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically \u00a7 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for \u201cincorrect\u201d electronic fund transfers.\n          These commenters noted that insofar as \u00a7 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an \u201cincorrect electronic fund transfer\u201d by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as \u00a7 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.",
                        "Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.",
                        "Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.",
                        "As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.",
                        "Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.",
                        "The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal\u2014such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market\u2014actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.",
                        "With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. See also \u00a7 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below."

                        "In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.",
                        "Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.",
                        "As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.\n          Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.",
                        "In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (i.e., if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.",
                        "Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.",
                        "After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. See \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2).",
                        "Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.",
                        "Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.",
                        "The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. See \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. See \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. See \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. See \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the \u201clatest date on which funds will be available\u201d).",
                        "Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.",
                        "With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (e.g., mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (e.g., an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.",
                        "The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under \u00a7 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is \u201cany person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.\u201d  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). See comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to \u201cJane Doe\u201d at a foreign bank, the provider discloses \u201cJane Doe\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to \u201cJohn Doe\u201d but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because \u201cJane Doe\u201d was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.",
                        "In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named \u201cJane Doe\u201d had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named \u201cJane Doe\u201d had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.",
                        "Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.",
                        "The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.",
                        "Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.",
                        "Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.",
                        "As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring."

Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire \u201cexceptions\u201d (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.",
                        "The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. See \u00a7 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.",
                        "To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, \u00a7 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.",
                        "EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under \u00a7 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.",
                        "Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue."

                        "The Board proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2) to establish the procedures and remedies for correcting an error. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), respectively, for an error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. See \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.",
                        "However, as discussed above with respect to proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.",
                        "Therefore, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.",
                        "The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.",
                        "The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.",

The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.",
                        "Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. See comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.",
                        "For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.",
                        "Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).",
                        "New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.",
                        "In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide \u201csuch other remedy\u201d as the Board determines appropriate \u201cfor the protection of senders.\u201d Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.",
                        "Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.",
                        "Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed \u00a7 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed \u00a7 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed \u00a7 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).",
                        "The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.",
                        "Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.",
                        "Moreover, consistent with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.",
                        "Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as \u00a7 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.",
                        "However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.",
                        "Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.",
                        "Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.",
                        "In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. See comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.",
                        "Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. See comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. See \u00a7 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.",
                        "Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of \u201camount appropriate to resolve the error.\u201d The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.",
                        "Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.",
                        "The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.",
                        "Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.",
                        "Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.",
                        "Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.",
                        "The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) and the remedy in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the \u201camount appropriate to resolve the error\u201d would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) or (2) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.",
                        "Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.",
                        "Finally, under proposed comment 33(c)-6, a remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without further investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender to be in error. This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10."

Such explanation would have to respond to the sender's specific complaint and note the sender's right to request the documents that the provider relied on in making its determination.

Furthermore, proposed comment 33(e)-1 explained that the remittance transfer provider would have no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error.

                "The Board proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(1) to implement the provision in EFTA section 919(e)(1) regarding the applicability of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions to EFTs. The proposed rule provided that if an alleged error in connection with a remittance transfer involved an incorrect EFT to a sender's account and the account was also held by the remittance transfer provider, then the requirements of proposed \u00a7 205.33, and its applicable time frames and procedures, governed the error resolution process. If the notice of error was asserted with an account-holding institution that was not the same entity as the remittance transfer provider, however, proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(1) provided that the error resolution procedures under \u00a7 205.11 (currently \u00a7 1005.11), and not those under \u00a7 205.33, would apply to the account-holding institution's investigation of the alleged error.",

But, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an account-holding institution would likely be unable to identify a particular EFT as a remittance transfer unless it was also the remittance transfer provider. In the absence of direct knowledge that a particular EFT was used to fund a remittance transfer, the account-holding institution would face significant compliance risk if the error resolution requirements under proposed \u00a7 205.33 were deemed to apply to the error.",
                "The Bureau agrees with the Board that such an outcome would be undesirable. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(1) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(f)(1) to permit an account-holding institution to comply with the error resolution requirements of \u00a7 1005.11 when the institution is not also the remittance transfer provider for the transaction in question. In such a case, the sender will also have independent error resolution rights against the remittance transfer provider itself under \u00a7 1005.33.",
                "Some industry commenters thought the proposed guidance was confusing and would apply more than one error resolution procedure to a remittance transfer provider. Although certain remittance transfer providers may have multiple error resolution obligations, these provisions are meant to resolve conflicts and provide greater certainty about which error resolution provisions apply in certain situations. Therefore, the Bureau is revising comment 33(f)-1 to provide such clarification.",
                "Revised comment 33(f)-1 provides that a financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.11 and 1005.33. The comment provides examples to illustrate when certain error resolution procedures apply to a remittance transfer provider that is also the account-holding institution from which the transfer is funded. In the first example, a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under \u00a7 1005.33, such as an omission of an EFT from a periodic statement. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. In the second example, a sender asserts an error under \u00a7 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under \u00a7 1005.11, such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of \u00a7 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.",
                "Proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) addressed the scenario where the consumer provides a notice of error to the creditor that issued the credit card with respect to an alleged error involving an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a remittance transfer, such as when a consumer provides a credit card to pay for a remittance transfer. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) provided that, in such a case, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, would apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements under proposed \u00a7 205.33. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) also stated that if the sender instead provides a notice of error asserting an incorrect payment amount involving the use of a credit card to the remittance transfer provider, then the error resolution provisions of proposed \u00a7 205.33 would apply to the remittance transfer provider.",
                "A creditor of a credit card or other credit account may also act as a remittance transfer provider in certain circumstances, such as when a cardholder sends funds from his or her credit card through a service offered by the creditor to a recipient in a foreign country. In this case, an error could potentially be asserted under either Regulation Z or the error resolution provisions applicable to remittance transfers in the case of an incorrect extension of credit in connection with the transfer. The Board proposed that under these circumstances, the error resolution provisions under Regulation Z \u00a7 1026.13 would apply to the alleged error, but solicited comment on the proposed approach.",
                "One commenter suggested that if a remittance transfer provider is serving multiple roles, such as a creditor that is also a remittance transfer provider, the remittance transfer provider should have the ability to choose which error resolution procedure to follow. The Bureau does not believe that remittance transfer providers should be permitted to choose the error resolution procedure to apply because providers and senders would benefit from the application of consistent procedures in similar situations.",
                "The Bureau agrees with the Board that it is reasonable to apply the Regulation Z error resolution provisions under circumstances where the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor because Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d)(1) permits a consumer to withhold disputed amounts while an error is being investigated. However, the Bureau believes that the additional time afforded to a sender to assert an error under \u00a7 1005.33 may also be of value. Therefore, for a remittance transfer provider that is also the creditor, the Bureau is requiring that the time period to assert an error under \u00a7 1005.33(b) should apply instead of the time period under 12 CFR 1026.13(b). This will also ensure that the error resolution notice required under \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) is consistent. Otherwise, disclosing to a sender that the time period to assert an error may in some instances be 60 days from the periodic statement reflecting the error and in other instances may be 180 days from the disclosed date of availability on the remittance transfer receipt could be confusing.",
                "The Bureau also believes further clarification is warranted for errors other than incorrect extensions of credit in connection with the remittance transfer. For example, an error involving an incorrect amount of currency received under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) may be asserted as an error involving goods or services that have not been delivered as agreed under \u00a7 1026.13(a)(3). Accordingly, the Bureau is adding these references to the final rule to resolve any potential conflicts. The Bureau adopts \u00a7 205.33(f)(2) in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(f)(2) with these revisions and amendments to clarify that the provision applies to all credit accounts rather than only credit card accounts.",
                "In addition, the Bureau notes that in certain circumstances, a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims or defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1). These rights are independent of other billing error rights a cardholder may have. See comment 12(c)-1 to 12 CFR 1026.12(c). Therefore, the Bureau is adopting a new comment 33(f)-2 to clarify that to the extent a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer under 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), nothing in \u00a7 1005.33 limits a sender's right in this regard.",
                "The Board also proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) to provide guidance where an alleged error involves an unauthorized EFT or unauthorized use of a credit card to send a remittance transfer, such as when a stolen debit or credit card is used to send funds to a foreign country. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) clarified that the consumer would have rights under Regulation E \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT or Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card. However, since the consumer holding the asset account or the credit card account is not the sender of the remittance transfer, proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) stated that the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers would not apply. See comment 33(b)-1. The Bureau agrees with the Board's proposal, and \u00a7 205.33(f)(3) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(f)(3) with an amendment to clarify application of the provision to credit accounts generally as opposed to only credit card accounts.",
                "Some industry commenters suggested that the reasoning the Board used in applying Regulation E \u00a7\u00a7 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT and Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card, should be used in applying UCC Article 4A provisions to an unauthorized wire transfer. As discussed above in the supplementary information to \u00a7 1005.30(e), UCC Article 4A-108 provides that Article 4A does not apply \u201cto a funds transfer, any part of which is governed by the [EFTA]\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed above, the Bureau may only preempt State law to the extent that there is an inconsistency. Since the Bureau does not believe there is an inconsistency between the EFTA and UCC Article 4A-108, UCC Article 4A does not apply to wire transfers that are remittance transfers under \u00a7 1005.30(e). Therefore, the Bureau declines to implement commenters' suggestion with respect to unauthorized wire transfers.",
                "Finally, the Board noted that in certain cases a consumer may be able to assert error resolution rights in connection with a remittance transfer with both the remittance transfer provider as well as the account-holding institution or credit card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 33(f)-2 addressed this situation by providing that if a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or the sender's account-holding institution or creditor, and then subsequently asserts the same error with the other party, the other party would have no further responsibilities to investigate the error. The proposed comment also clarified that an account-holding institution or creditor may reverse amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if the consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same error and provided an example to illustrate this concept.",
                "One industry commenter noted that the provisions in \u00a7 1005.33(f) could provide a consumer with potentially different error resolution procedures depending on who the consumer decides to contact. This may be the case if the remittance transfer provider is not also the account-holding institution or creditor. However, proposed comment 33(f)-2 explains that the second party has no error resolution obligations if the sender already received credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer. This comment makes clear that a consumer may not receive a windfall by successfully asserting an error with both the provider and the account-holding institution and/or credit card issuer or creditor.",
                "Another industry commenter suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to delay providing a remedy until expiration of the card issuer's chargeback right under network rules to prevent duplicate recoveries when remittances are funded by a debit card or a credit card. The Bureau believes that the delay would be disadvantageous for senders in getting a speedy resolution to an error and that proposed comment 33(f)-2 is a better method for dealing with the possibility of duplicate recoveries. The Bureau adopts this comment, renumbered as comment 33(f)-3, substantially as proposed.",
                "Lastly, the Bureau received comment from an industry commenter questioning which error resolution provisions apply when a sender has multiple funding sources for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender could fund a remittance transfer partly by a balance in the sender's account held by the remittance transfer provider and partly by a credit card or an ACH transfer from the sender's checking account. In such cases, the Bureau notes that which error resolution procedure will apply depends on the error that is asserted. For example, if the error asserted is the incorrect extension of credit in connection with the remittance transfer, then \u00a7 1005.33(f)(2) provides that \u00a7 1026.13 applies to the creditor while \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor, only \u00a7 1026.13 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card.",
                "Similarly, if the error asserted is an incorrect EFT from a sender's account, then \u00a7 1005.33(f)(1) provides that \u00a7 1005.11 applies to the account-holding institution while \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the account-holding institution, only \u00a7 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. The Bureau believes the regulation and commentary as adopted provide sufficient guidance in this regard, and additional clarification is not necessary."

                "Pursuant to EFTA section 919(d)(2), the Bureau must establish clear and appropriate standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers, to protect senders from such errors. EFTA section 919(d)(2) specifically provides that such standards must include appropriate standards regarding recordkeeping, including retention of certain error-resolution related documentation. The Board proposed \u00a7 205.33(g) to implement these error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements.",
                "Specifically, proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with respect to the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers. The proposed rule also stated that remittance transfer providers must take steps to ensure that whenever a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this approach is similar to one taken by the Federal banking agencies in other contexts. See, e.g., 12 CFR 1022.90(e) (requiring that an identity theft red flags program exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service-provider arrangements).",
                "One industry commenter suggested that the failure to maintain written policies and procedures should not be an independent cause of action. The Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers must develop written policies and procedures in order to demonstrate compliance to the appropriate regulator. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe the requirement to maintain written policies and procedures that the remittance transfer provider must follow imposes any additional burden.",
                "The Bureau is making one change to proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1). Specifically, the Bureau is deleting the provision in proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1) that requires remittance transfer providers to take steps to ensure that when a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. The Bureau believes that this provision is no longer necessary in light of the decision under \u00a7 1005.35, discussed below, to provide that a remittance transfer provider is liable for any violation of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(1), as revised, is adopted in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(g)(1).",
                "Under proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) a remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures concerning error resolution would be required to include provisions regarding the retention of documentation related to an error investigation. Such provisions would be required to ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error, which is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(2).",
                "Proposed comment 33(g)-1 clarified that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13, which apply to any person subject to the EFTA. Accordingly, remittance transfer providers would be required to retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. Similar to comment 13-1, proposed comment 33(g)-1 provided that the record retention requirements do not require a remittance transfer provider to maintain records of individual disclosures of remittance transfers that it has provided to each sender. Instead, a provider need only retain records to ensure that it can comply with a sender's request for documentation or other information relating to a particular remittance transfer, including a request for supporting documentation to enable the sender to determine whether an error exists with respect to that transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) or proposed comment 33(g)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(2) substantially as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.33(g)(2), but with an amendment to make clear that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under \u00a7 1005.13. The Bureau also adopts comment 33(g)-1 with amendments to conform the comment to comment 13-1 and to the changes in \u00a7 1005.33(g)(2)."

Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1005.33(h)(1) through (4) would have provided four conditions, including:  That the provider be able to demonstrate that the sender did in fact provide an incorrect account number, that the provider gave the sender notice that if the sender provided an incorrect account number that the transfer could be lost, that the incorrect account number resulted a deposit of the transfer into the wrong account, and that the provider used reasonable efforts to attempt to retrieve the mis-deposited funds.",
                "In response to proposed \u00a7 1005.33(h), many industry commenters sought more specificity in the conditions, especially with respect to the form of notice required to inform senders that the transfer amount could be lost, what would satisfy as a reasonable effort to retrieve lost funds, and the timeframe in which such efforts would be deemed prompt.  Other industry participants, however, supported the generality in the proposed conditions because the commenters believed that the conditions provided flexibility and accommodated existing practice.  In addition, some industry commenters expressed concern with the proposed condition that funds actually be mis-deposited into the wrong account for the proposed exception to apply.  These commenters argued that often it is difficult for remittance transfer providers to know whether funds have in fact been mis-deposited.  The Bureau has considered these comments and is finalizing the rule with five conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h)(1) through (5), each of which is discussed below.",
                "Generally speaking, the Bureau believes that the conditions set forth in \u00a7 1005.33(h) are consistent with industry best practices today and will provide further incentive to continue improving safeguards against mis-deposit over time.  Where a remittance transfer is deposited into the wrong account today, the Bureau believes that many, if not most, providers already attempt to recover the principal amount of the transfer.  However, because providers have reported that they often do not have direct relationships with receiving institutions, and that in some instances those institutions may be unresponsive to requests for assistance, providers may face difficulties in recovering funds from the wrong account.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances, to reverse these transactions requires the accountholder to authorize a debit from the account and, thus, the lack of this authority may prohibit a recipient institution from debiting the account in the amount of the incorrect deposit absent an authorization.  Relatedly, a provider in the United States may be able to do little to assist the foreign institution in its attempt to persuade its accountholder to provide debit authorization due to the lack of privity between the provider and the recipient institution or the accountholder.",
                "Thus, the 2013 Final Rule strikes an appropriate balance by limiting the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to circumstances of actual mis-deposits and by requiring reasonable verification methods, without holding remittance transfer providers responsible for circumstances beyond their control."

However, and as noted above, the Bureau is expanding the exception to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to include senders' mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, as well as mistakes regarding account numbers.",
                "In response to the Bureau's request for comment on sender mistakes generally, some industry commenters acknowledged that, in some instances, institution identifier information provided by senders may be at least partially verifiable.  Foremost among these are BICs (sometimes referred to as SWIFT codes) and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters noted, however, that verification is neither ubiquitous nor perfect.  Several consumer group commenters argued, on the other hand, that the Bureau should not expand the exception to mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers because remittance transfer providers should be able to verify such identifiers.",
                "As a result of the Bureau's inclusion of recipient institution identifiers in the exception to the definition of error under \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2), which provides that for any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.",
                "As adopted, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) will permit remittance transfer providers to rely on the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) only in situations where no reasonable verification is possible or where reasonably available means were applied but were unable to prevent a mis-deposit that occurred because the sender provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier.  The exception does not apply to account number mistakes insofar as the Bureau continues to believe that no reasonable means to verify that an account number matches the name of the designated recipient disclosed to the sender exists today for most transfers. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether expansion of the condition is appropriate.  Furthermore, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) requires that the verification occur prior to or when the provider is sending the transfer because if the verification occurs later it may be too late to prevent a mis-deposit.",
                "The Bureau is adopting new comment 33(h)-1, which explains that the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies only when a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.  Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Comment 33(h)-1 explains that providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h).  Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in \u00a7 1005.33(h).  However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.",
                "The Bureau is adopting this provision because upon further consideration, it concludes that if remittance transfer providers want to avail themselves of the exception to \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, they must take reasonable steps to limit the occurrence of these mistakes.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances providers can and currently do verify the accuracy of some identifiers, and that in many other instances verification is not feasible.  For example, many providers require, and senders provide, BICs to identify recipient institutions.  Providers, or their third-party partners, typically have access to a directory in which they can match the BIC with the institution name (and possibly location), and the Bureau believes many providers (or their business partners) perform such verifications today.  The Bureau also recognizes, however, that some providers may not conduct such verification.  In other instances, precise verification that the sender has identified the proper institution may be challenging, particularly if a recipient institution has no BIC code or other type of identifier for which there is an internationally accessible directory, or if a sender has not given all the information about the recipient institution that may be reflected in a numerical identifier, such as the branch location.\n        The Bureau believes the requirement appropriately requires verification where such mechanisms are reasonable available.",
                "Finally, the Bureau notes that it intends to monitor the availability of other means to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and it may propose to revise \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (h)(2) and the related commentary if such means become reasonably available."

Those commenters who preferred the flexibility of the proposed notice provisions argued that remittance transfer providers may already provide this sort of notice in a number of different forms.

                "This provision reflects three changes from the December Proposal:  (1) Mention of recipient institution identifiers in light of the expanded scope of \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D); (2) clarification that the notice must be provided before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer; (3) clarification that this notice may be given orally if provided along with a prepayment disclosure provided orally in accordance with \u00a7 1005.31(a)(2).\n        The Bureau believes that the requirement that the notice be provided before authorization of the transfer is generally in accordance with how most providers currently provide notice today and thus should not be a significant change from existing practice. The 2013 Final Rule does not specify the form of such notice but the Bureau intends to monitor how providers implement this condition to determine whether additional specificity is appropriate.",
                "The Bureau notes that, pursuant to the revisions to \u00a7 1005.31(a)(1) discussed above, the notice provided pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(h)(3), like all disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, in \u00a7 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. See also comment 33(a)(1)-1.  In addition, insofar as the Bureau has also amended the foreign language requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g) to apply to all disclosures permitted by the 2013 Final Rule, the notice permitted by \u00a7 1005.33(h)(3) must be disclosed in accordance with the foreign language disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1005.33(g)(1).",
                "As explained in the December Proposal, the Bureau's goal is to ensure that senders are informed of the risks of a mistake.  Given that many remittance transfer providers are already providing notices of this risk through various means, the Bureau wants to ensure that the practice is adopted across the remainder of the industry while minimizing the need to change existing notices if they were already sufficient for the purposes of proposed \u00a7 1005.33(h)(2).  While the Bureau understands that providing model language might make compliance easier for some providers, the Bureau believes that there are sufficient models available in providers' existing materials that it is inappropriate to delay adoption of this condition while the Bureau designs and tests appropriate model language."

Other consumer group commenters disagreed, however, asserting that, in their opinion, remittance transfer providers typically can retrieve funds that have been misrouted unless the funds are deposited into the wrong customer's account.  These consumer group commenters opined that so long as the funds remain in an institution's control, there is generally no concern that those funds will disappear.",

To the extent that commenters' concerns related to the delay of funds rather than their disappearance, as noted above, the Bureau declines to expand the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to cover delayed transfers rather than actual mis-deposited transfers."

Two other commenters\u2014a trade association and credit union\u2014asked that the Bureau provide more explanation regarding the timeframe to meet the promptness requirement and the number of attempts to recover the funds required.

The Bureau does not believe clarification on this point is necessary, insofar as nothing in the 2013 Final Rule states that a provider is required to advance funds that the recipient institution cannot retrieve from a customer if the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies.

The Bureau continues to believe\u2014as it explained in the December Proposal\u2014that it is not appropriate to mandate specific methods that a remittance transfer provider must use to attempt to recover funds.

Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Under \u00a7 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law.  The two examples in proposed comments 33(h)-1.i and .ii are finalized as proposed as comments 33(h)-2.i. and .ii.",

The Bureau received comments from industry that it should clarify when exactly reasonable efforts are considered to be prompt and also that it should create a safe harbor time period in which efforts would be deemed prompt.  The Bureau continues to believe that whether a particular provider's efforts are prompt depends on the facts and circumstances, for instance when the fact of an error is first identified.  In general, the Bureau believes a provider acts promptly where it acts before the date that the funds are expected to be made available to the recipient, but a provider may not have notice that there is a problem with the transfer that early.  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted proposed comment 33(h)-2 as comment 33(h)-3 and is expanding its discussion.  The comment adopts the proposed language explaining that \u00a7 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient and that whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances.  The comment also provides an example stating that where a sender informs the provider that he or she had provided a mistaken account number before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the provider has acted promptly if it attempts to contact the institution that received the incorrect remittance transfer before the disclosed date of availability."

In the proposal, the Board recognized that remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer generally cannot be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. See, e.g., UCC Article 4A-211 (providing that a payment order cannot be cancelled or amended once it has been accepted unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank). The Board stated that it believed that under such circumstances, a bank or credit union making transfers by ACH or wire transfer would likely wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period had passed, which could delay the receipt of the funds in the foreign country. The Board stated that one business day would provide a reasonable time frame for a sender to evaluate whether to cancel a remittance transfer after providing payment for the transfer, but requested comment regarding whether the proposed minimum time period should be longer or shorter than proposed.",
                "Many industry commenters objected to the proposed cancellation right. One industry commenter believed a cancellation right was unnecessary for remittance transfers because fees incurred by the sender for a remittance transfer were minimal. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that a cancellation right would give senders less incentive to provide accurate information. One industry commenter believed senders could use the cancellation right to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates. The industry commenter believed remittance transfer providers would increase exchange rates to compensate for the risk of loss.",
                "Industry and trade group commenters agreed with the Board that the proposed cancellation period would delay processing routine remittance transfers because remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer would likely be held until the cancellation period passed. Some industry commenters believed that the delay in processing would make it more difficult to determine an exchange rate. A member of Congress urged the Bureau to take into consideration senders' expectation for timely execution of remittance transfers in determining the appropriate cancellation period. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed a sender would want to remit funds as quickly as possible, and that the proposed cancellation right could cause senders to make payments using remittance mechanisms that are not subject to Regulation E.",
                "Consumer group commenters believed that the Bureau should require a one business day cancellation period, but suggested that the Bureau study when cancellations typically occur. These commenters suggested that a study could help the Bureau determine that decreasing the cancellation period could adequately protect senders. Many industry commenters believed that if the Bureau required a cancellation period, the period should be shorter than one business day. The commenters suggested a variety of shorter cancellation periods that could be more appropriate. Some industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to the same day or an hour. Several industry commenters believed the right to cancel should end when the remittance transfer provider executes the payment instruction. Several industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to 30 minutes, noting that this time period would be consistent with Texas law.",
                "Some industry commenters suggested that institutions sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer should be exempt from the cancellation rules. Other industry commenters suggested that a sender should have the right to opt out of the cancellation right to have the transfer sent immediately. Another industry commenter suggested that the provider should only be required to cancel if the provider has a reasonable opportunity to act upon the request. One industry commenter believed a right to refund remittance transfers that are unclaimed was a more appropriate cancellation policy. An industry commenter believed the provider should not be required to honor cancellation requests that are made for fraudulent purposes.",
                "Other industry commenters believed the cancellation rules should be disclosure-based. One industry commenter believed that instead of a cancellation right, the provider should disclose that once a sender signs the remittance transaction agreement, it cannot be cancelled and that a failure to carry out a sender's cancellation request once a remittance agreement has been signed is not an error. Another industry commenter believed that if a provider had a cancellation policy, that the Bureau should require that it be properly disclosed.",
                "The Bureau believes that a cancellation right could be helpful to senders of remittance transfers. The Bureau also believes, however, that providers sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer likely will delay transactions for the length of the cancellation period because such transfers are often difficult to retract once they are sent. A cancellation period of one business day thus could prevent a sender from sending a remittance transfer quickly. In addition, a long cancellation period could create an unfair competitive advantage for closed network money transmitters, who are less likely to delay sending a remittance transfer until the end of the cancellation period. Therefore, the Bureau believes a cancellation period shorter than one business day is appropriate.",
                "The final rule requires a 30-minute cancellation period.\n        A 30-minute cancellation period provides the sender the opportunity to review both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt to ensure that the transfer was sent as the sender intended. However, the 30-minute cancellation period should not substantially delay transactions for senders who want to send funds quickly. The Bureau notes that 30 minutes is the minimum time that a provider must allow senders to cancel transactions, but providers may choose to permit senders to cancel transactions after the 30 minute period has passed. Moreover, even after the cancellation period has passed, senders may still assert their rights under \u00a7 1005.33 and obtain a refund or other remedy for transactions where an error occurred.",
                "As discussed above, the final rule sets forth new cancellation requirements in a new \u00a7 1005.36 with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau believes that when a sender schedules a remittance transfer more than three days in advance of when the remittance transfer is made, a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to a sender. In those circumstances, the Bureau believes a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after scheduling the transfer to be made, given the potentially significant delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. Circumstances could change in the intervening period that would negate the purpose of the transfer. At the same time, allowing the sender to cancel certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance for up to 30 minutes after the transfer is made could be burdensome to both senders and providers. A sender may not know the precise time of day that the transfer is scheduled, and such a rule would extend the period of uncertainty for providers, who may delay a transfer until the cancellation period has expired. Consequently, the 30-minute cancellation period described in \u00a7 1005.34(a) does not apply to remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and a remittance transfer provider must instead comply with the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(c).",
                "Section 1005.34(a) of the final rule provides that, except as provided in \u00a7 1005.36(c), a remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if the following two conditions are met.",
                "First, under proposed \u00a7 205.34(a)(1), a valid request to cancel a remittance transfer must enable the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled. Proposed comment 34(a)-1 clarified that the request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the transfer. The proposed comment also permitted the provider to request, or the sender to provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the provider can identify the transfer to which the cancellation request applies.",
                "Second, proposed \u00a7 205.34(a)(2) provided that a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer is effective so long as the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into an account held by the recipient.\n        Proposed comment 34(a)-2 reiterated that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer in the receipt or combined notice, as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment clarified that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer.",
                "The Bureau did not receive comment on the two conditions on the right to cancel. The final rule adopts the two conditions as proposed in renumbered \u00a7 1005.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, the Bureau adopts comments 34(a)-1 and 34(a)-2 substantially as proposed.",
                "The Bureau is also adding comment 34(a)-3 to explain how a remittance transfer provider could comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of \u00a7 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The comment states that a provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. The comment clarifies that a provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.",
                "One industry commenter believed that the Bureau should require a sender to contact the remittance transfer provider directly in order to cancel a transaction. The commenter believed that agents should not be required to handle cancellation requests, noting that under certain State laws, the agent does not have a right to the funds paid for a remittance transfer and therefore could not make a refund.",
                "The Bureau believes that a sender's cancellation request should be valid if the sender contacts the agent. Many participants in consumer testing indicated that they would contact an agent first if they encountered a problem with their remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that requiring a sender to contact a remittance transfer provider by, for example, calling the telephone number listed on the receipt could frustrate the sender's ability to cancel within the 30-minute cancellation period. Consequently, the Bureau clarifies in comment 34(a)-4 that a cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under \u00a7 1005.34(a) when received by the agent. The Bureau understands, however, that an agent may not be able to provide a sender with the refund for legal or operational reasons, and, as discussed below, the final rule does not require an agent to provide a refund if the agent is unable to do so.",
                "Finally, the Bureau is adding a comment to clarify when a sender makes a payment for a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when the 30-minute cancellation period has passed. Comment 34(a)-5 clarifies that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized."

The proposed rule stated that a remittance transfer provider must refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees imposed in connection with the requested transfer, within three business days of receiving the sender's valid cancellation request.",
                "Many industry commenters objected to the requirement in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to refund the total amount of funds to the sender. Industry commenters believed that requiring a refund of the total amount of funds raised significant safety and soundness concerns for institutions sending wire transfers because some remittance transfer providers would be unable to recover the funds from subsequent institutions in a transfer chain. One money transmitter commenter stated that once a transfer is booked at an agent location, the provider is obligated to pay the agent its portion of the transfer fees for the transaction. If a sender cancels the transaction after settlement, the provider would be required to negotiate the return of the fee from the agent or bear the total loss of the fee. Similarly, the commenter noted that it acted as an agent of international billers and is obligated to the billers for the funds when it sends data to the biller. Several industry commenters believed requiring a remittance transfer provider to refund all fees could increase costs for senders, since providers may increase fees to account for losses due to refund. A money transmitter commenter also argued that refunding a third party fee or tax could be impermissible under local law.",
                "Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau permit a remittance transfer provider to charge reasonable fees, even if the sender cancels the transaction. Some of the commenters noted that this was consistent with a bank's ability to charge fees in connection with a stop payment order on a check to cover the bank's costs. An industry trade association believed providers should be permitted to charge a $45 fee to stop the transaction. Another industry commenter suggested that if the exchange rate changes between the time the order is placed and the refund is requested such that the amount of local currency originally promised would be equivalent to less U.S. dollars, the refund of the principal should be at the new exchange rate.",
                "Some commenters believed a remittance transfer provider should not be required to provide a refund in certain circumstances. One industry commenter believed a provider should not be required to refund fees charged by intermediaries. Another industry commenter suggested that a provider should not have to refund the portion of any fees that are not attributable to costs incurred by them prior to receiving a cancellation request. A trade association believed a provider should not be required to refund fees when the provider has not made any errors.",
                "The Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a provider to refund the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau believes senders could be discouraged from exercising their cancellation rights if they could not recover the cost of the remittance transfer. Although the Bureau recognizes that a provider may not be able to recover some fees or taxes charged for a transfer, the Bureau believes that the shorter cancellation period adopted in the final rule helps address these concerns. Under the final rule, a provider can mitigate some of the risk of losing fees or taxes charged for a transfer by sending a transfer after the 30-minute cancellation period ends. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring the total amount of funds provided by the sender to be refunded in the final rule in \u00a7 1005.34(b) with the additional clarification that refunding the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer requires a provider to refund taxes on the remittance transfer. However, as noted by one industry commenter, for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Consequently, the requirement in \u00a7 1005.34(b) to refund taxes is only to the extent such refund is not prohibited by law. In the final rule, \u00a7 1005.34(b) provides that a remittance transfer provider shall refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.",
                "Proposed comment 34(b)-1 addressed the permissible ways in which a provider could provide a refund. The proposed comment clarified that a remittance transfer provider may, at the provider's discretion, issue a refund in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially tendered by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment.",
                "The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 34(b)-1. However, as discussed above regarding comment 33(c)-6, the Bureau is amending comment 34(b)-1 with respect to refunds if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. Specifically, comment 34(b)-1 states that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.",
                "The Bureau is also finalizing comment 34(b)-2, which addresses costs that must be refunded upon a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with amendments clarifying that all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer would include taxes that are assessed by a State or other governmental body, to the extent not prohibited by law. Therefore, the final comment states that if a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.",
                "Finally, industry commenters suggested amendments to the requirement in the proposal to provide a refund within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer. One industry commenter believed the refund rule should not require the refund to be delivered to the sender within three business days. The commenter cited examples of when it could be difficult to deliver the funds to the sender in three days, such as when the provider mails a refund check and the check takes several days to be delivered to the sender; when the refund is available at an agent location, but the sender takes several days to pick-up the refund; and when the provider issues a chargeback to the sender's credit or debit card account, but the credit takes several days to appear due to card processing systems. The Bureau notes that the requirement to refund funds to a sender does not require a provider to ensure that a refund is delivered to a sender within three business days after receiving the sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer."

EFTA section 919(f)(1) generally makes remittance transfer providers liable for any violation of EFTA section 919 by an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with such provider, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. EFTA section 919(f)(2) requires the Bureau to prescribe rules to implement appropriate standards or conditions of liability of a remittance transfer provider, including one that acts through its agent or authorized delegate.",
                "The Board proposed two alternatives to implement EFTA section 919(f) with respect to acts of agents. Under the first alternative (proposed Alternative A), a remittance transfer provider would be strictly liable for violations of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Under the second alternative (proposed Alternative B), a remittance transfer provider would be liable under the EFTA for violations by an agent acting for the provider, unless the provider establishes and maintains policies and procedures for agent compliance, including appropriate oversight measures, and the provider corrects any violation, to the extent appropriate.",
                "Consumer groups, State regulators, and a Federal Reserve Bank supported proposed Alternative A. These commenters stated that Alternative A would provide the greatest incentives for remittance transfer providers to avoid errors and to oversee and audit their agents. Some argued that proposed Alternative A would be consistent with many State laws, and that adopting proposed Alternative B could disrupt efforts to hold providers to stricter liability standards under State law.",
                "In contrast, industry commenters supported the liability standard set forth in proposed Alternative B. These commenters argued that proposed Alternative B would more appropriately address the unique position of agents in the market, while providing protection for consumers by making them whole for the cost of the remittance transfer. These commenters also stated that proposed Alternative B would create an incentive for providers to take an active role in developing compliance policies and procedures and engaging in agent oversight. These commenters also expressed concern about the liability risks associated with proposed Alternative A for the misconduct or a single agent or isolated violations, and that proposed Alternative A could discourage the use of agents.",
                "Based on comments received and the Bureau's further analysis, the final rule adopts proposed Alternative A in renumbered \u00a7 1005.35. The Bureau believes that the approach taken in proposed Alternative A is more consistent with the approach generally taken in other Bureau regulations, including Regulation E. For example, under Regulation E's payroll card rules, a financial institution is required to provide initial payroll card disclosures to a payroll account holder. If, by contractual agreement with the institution, a third-party service provider or the employer agrees to deliver these disclosures on the institution's behalf and fails to do so, the issuing financial institution is nonetheless liable for the violation.\n        Similarly, if an agent at a retail establishment fails to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider would be liable. The Bureau also believes that proposed Alternative A provides a greater incentive for providers to monitor their agents' activities and to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight than proposed Alternative B.",
                "One commenter suggested that proposed Alternative A could exculpate an agent from responsibility from its own conduct. However, nothing in the rule shields agents from liability, nor does it prevent providers from requiring specific agent conduct in their contracts or negotiating other contractual liability or indemnification clauses.",
                "With respect to commenters' concerns about liability risk, EFTA section 919(f)(2) states that enforcement agencies may consider, in any action or other proceeding against a remittance transfer provider, the extent to which the provider had established and maintained policies or procedures for compliance, including policies, procedures, or other appropriate oversight measures designed to assure compliance by an agent or authorized delegate acting for such provider. Thus, enforcement agencies are permitted to tailor any remedies in light of single agent non-compliance or isolated violations.",
                "Several commenters requested further guidance on what it means for an agent to act for a provider. As discussed in the proposal, some agents have a non-exclusive arrangement with several remittance transfer providers, so that a sender may choose from among the remittance transfer providers at that agent location. If a sender chooses to use Provider A to send funds at the agent location, then Provider B would not be liable for the agent's actions in connection with that transaction, because the agent would be acting for Provider A. As noted above regarding the definition of \u201cagent\u201d under \u00a7 1005.30(a), the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to defer to State or other applicable law with respect to the relationship between an agent and Provider A.",
                "The final rule also adopts proposed Alternative A's comment 35-1 substantially as proposed. Comment 35-1 explains that remittance transfer providers remain fully responsible for complying with the requirements of this subpart, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in \u00a7 1005.31 and remedying any errors as set forth in \u00a7 1005.33. This is the case even if a remittance transfer provider performs its functions through an agent, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient."

If the general timing rule in \u00a7 1005.31(e) applied, the provider would be required to provide a pre-payment disclosure at the time the scheduled payments are authorized. By requiring a pre-payment disclosure at this alternative time for each subsequent transfer, senders will receive information about their transfers in closer proximity to the scheduled transfer date, and the provider should be in a better position to make the required disclosures. This approach also reminds senders about the pending transfer, which will enable them to confirm that sufficient funds are available for the transfer. In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on a safe harbor with respect to the reasonable time requirement.",
                "In addition, under \u00a7 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), the provider must provide the receipt described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(2) for each subsequent transfer. As with pre-payment disclosures, the Bureau does not believe a receipt given at the time payment for the transfer is authorized would be as useful to senders as a receipt received closer in time to the actual transfer that contains more relevant information about the particular scheduled transfer. The final rule requires the receipt to be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. However, if the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) closely tracks the receipt timing rule for receipts in transactions conducted entirely by telephone under \u00a7 1005.31(e)(2).",

Thus, except as permitted by \u00a7 1005.32, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt provided for the first scheduled transfer must be accurate when payment is made; that is, at the time the transfer is authorized.",

                "As discussed above, the Bureau believes that it would be problematic to apply the general rule about accuracy in \u00a7 1005.31(f) to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. For example, some preauthorized remittance transfers are set up to vary in amount, so the provider cannot predict, at the time such transfers are authorized, the amount to be transferred in subsequent months. Therefore, the provider could not provide an accurate pre-payment disclosure and receipt at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers, and payment for the transfers, are authorized. The accuracy requirement in \u00a7 1005.31(f) also would present a challenge to determining an applicable exchange rate for subsequent transfers, in that the provider may not know the exchange rate that will apply to subsequent transfers at the time of authorization. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the Act and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt special requirements for accurate disclosures about subsequent scheduled transfers in \u00a7 1005.36(b). In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the use of estimates for certain disclosures with respect to the first scheduled transfer."

                "Under \u00a7 1005.34(a), senders are permitted to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel the remittance transfer is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if certain conditions are met. As noted above, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. The Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel a transaction no later than 30 minutes after payment is authorized would not be appropriate for certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Such a rule would permit cancellation only for a short time after the transfers are authorized, even though the remittance transfer may not occur for many days, weeks, or months. For example, if on March 1 a sender scheduled a remittance transfer for March 23, under the general cancellation rule, the sender would be required to cancel 30 minutes after the transfer was authorized on March 1, despite the fact that the transfer is not being made until March 23. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a different cancellation period in these circumstances because payment is authorized well before the transfer is to be made.",
                "Consequently, the Bureau is adopting a special cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.36(c) that it believes is more appropriate for these types of transfers. Section 1005.36(c) states that, for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.",
                "The Bureau believes that this time period is more beneficial to senders because it generally provides them more time to decide whether to go through with a scheduled transfer. Senders will have the opportunity to change their minds about sending a transfer if, for example, circumstances change between when the transfer is authorized and when the transfer is to be made. At the same time, the Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel at least three days before a transfer is made gives providers sufficient time to process any cancellation requests before a transfer is made. Many financial institutions that permit senders to schedule remittance transfers at least three business days before the date of the transfer are already subject to the stop payment provisions in Regulation E for preauthorized transfers that are EFTs, which require consumers to notify the institution at least three business days before the scheduled date of a preauthorized EFT. See \u00a7 1005.10(c).",
                "The cancellation provisions in both \u00a7\u00a7 1005.34(a) and 1005.36(c) permit a sender to cancel a remittance transfer after the transfer has been authorized. Under both provisions, a cancellation period may expire before the transfer itself is made. As noted above, the Bureau expects financial institutions making transfers by ACH or wire transfer may decide to wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period has passed because these types of remittance transfers generally cannot easily be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. For the same reason, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a sender to cancel before a transfer is made in \u00a7 1005.36(c).",
                "Under \u00a7 1005.36(c), a transfer must be cancelled only if the request to cancel is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer, so that a provider has sufficient time to prevent the transfer from taking place on the scheduled date. Therefore, under the final rule, only transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.36(c). Remittance transfers that are scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in \u00a7 1005.34(a). For example, if a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3, the sender may cancel up to 30 minutes after scheduling the payment on March 1. Thus, in every case, a sender has an opportunity to cancel a remittance transfer.",
                "The Bureau is adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of \u00a7 1005.36(c). Comment 36(c)-1 clarifies that a remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.",
                "Comment 36(c)-1 also clarifies three circumstances where the provisions of \u00a7 1005.36(c) do not apply, such that a provider should instead comply with the 30-minute cancellation rule in \u00a7 1005.34. For example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3. In this instance, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer is scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(c) also does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer. In this example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer requires further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.",
                "The other example in comment 36(c)-1 demonstrates situations where \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply because a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time and not because a sender schedules the transfer at least three business days before the date of the transfer. For example, \u00a7 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds are not deducted from the sender's account until March 5.",
                "Comment 36(c)-2 clarifies how a remittance transfer provider should treat requests to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers in a manner consistent with the stop payment provisions of Regulation E. See \u00a7 1005.10(c) and comment 10(c)-2. The comment clarifies that for preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.",
                "Finally, comment 36(c)-3 clarifies that a financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under \u00a7 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under \u00a7 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under \u00a7 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under \u00a7 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of \u00a7 1005.36 exclusively apply. The Bureau notes that in these circumstances, a provider would not be permitted to require the sender to give written confirmation of a cancellation within 14 days of an oral notification, as is permitted for stop payment orders in \u00a7 1005.10(c)(2). The Bureau believes that a sender should be able to orally cancel any remittance transfer, including a remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, without the additional burden of providing written confirmation of the cancellation.",

For example, a remittance transfer provider may substitute the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms\u2014such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information\u2014with information applicable to the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also eliminate disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as permitted under \u00a7 1005.31(b), or provide the required disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats. A remittance transfer provider may correct or update telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time. This example applies to all telephone numbers and addresses on a model form, including the contact information of the provider, the State agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The instruction clarifies that adding the term \u201cEstimated\u201d or a substantially similar term and in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, as required under \u00a7 1005.31(d), is a permissible change to the model forms. A provider may provide the required disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.31(g), without losing the benefit of the safe harbor.",
                "Instruction 4 to Appendix A includes an additional example of a permissible change a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor to reflect the addition of \u00a7 1005.36 in the final rule. The instruction clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may substitute cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1005.36(c). For example, for disclosures provided for a preauthorized remittance transfer, a provider could replace the statement that a sender can cancel the remittance transfer within 30 minutes with a statement that a sender may cancel up to three business days before the date of each transfer. Finally, instruction 4 to Appendix A also clarifies that adding language to a form that is not segregated from the required disclosures is impermissible, other than as permitted by \u00a7 1005.31(c)(4).",
                "Although the Bureau did not receive comments on the instructions to Model Forms A-30 through A-41, the Bureau did receive suggested changes to the terminology used in and the formatting of the model forms. For example, consumer group commenters believed that the amount of the cost of the transaction expressed as \u201cTotal\u201d in the proposal should be labeled in bold as \u201cTotal cost to you of this transfer\u201d and that \u201cTotal to recipient\u201d should be labeled in bold as \u201cTotal amount recipient should receive.\u201d The commenters also believed the term \u201cTotal Amount\u201d was too generic and instead should be \u201cAmount Transferred.\u201d An industry commenter believed that fees and taxes charged by entities other than the remittance transfer provided should be labeled as \u201cReceive\u201d or \u201cPayout\u201d fees and taxes, rather than \u201cOther\u201d fees and taxes.",
                "The Bureau believes that the proposed terms sufficiently describe the amounts disclosed on the model forms. The proposed terms were used in consumer testing, and nearly all participants understood the amounts that were disclosed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that requiring bolding or similar font requirements could pose compliance difficulties for remittance transfer providers that print the disclosures on a register or other printing device that does not permit such font changes, and participants in consumer testing did not have difficulty finding this information on the forms. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the terms and format as proposed.",
                "Consumer group commenters asserted that the content of the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in Model Form A-36 was misleading and not consumer friendly. The commenters provided edits to the disclosure that the commenter believed would be more helpful to a sender. The long form error resolution and cancellation disclosure is based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. See 31 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3. The Bureau believes that any changes to this model form should be made in conjunction with the corresponding changes to existing Regulation E model forms and that such changes should be subject to consumer testing. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting the content of Model Form A-36 as proposed.",
                "Other commenters suggested substantive changes that, if adopted, would result in changes to the model forms. For example, some industry commenters suggested that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose fees and taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider and that the model forms should instead indicate generally that other fees and charges may apply. Similarly, industry commenters suggested the exchange rate and funds availability date should be permitted to be estimated and, therefore, the model forms should state that these disclosures are subject to change. As discussed above, the Bureau is not adopting these substantive changes in the final rule. Consequently, the Bureau is not adopting the corresponding changes to the model forms.",
                "Finally, a consumer advocate suggested that a fraud warning should be added to the model forms. Such a warning is not required in the statute, and the Bureau believes that the disclosures should be limited to information relating to cost, error resolution, and cancellation. Adding more information and warnings to forms could overwhelm a sender and result in the sender not reading any of the information on the form. Therefore, the Bureau is not adding such a fraud warning to the model disclosures.",
                "The Bureau is, however, making two changes to the model forms that reflect changes from the proposal to the final rule, as discussed above. First, the Bureau is requiring that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. See comment 31(b)(1)-1. As such, the model forms have been amended to demonstrate how a remittance transfer provider would disclose fees separately from taxes. Second, the final rule provides that a sender may cancel a transaction within thirty minutes of making payment, rather than within one business day, as proposed, and the model forms have been amended to reflect this change.",
                "The Bureau is making additional changes to Model Form A-37 in the final rule. The Bureau is removing sample phone number, Web site, and remittance transfer company name that was included in the proposed form. Unlike the model pre-payment disclosures, receipts, and combined disclosures, sample information is not necessary to demonstrate how the short form error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be completed. Thus, in the final rule, Model Form A-37 includes brackets indicating where this information should be entered by a provider. The forward slash used in the proposal to indicate that funds may be picked up or deposited is also replaced with the word \u201cor.\u201d The Bureau is also amending the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights.",
                "The Bureau is also making minor technical changes in some of the model forms in the final rule for clarity. Plus signs are added to some forms to indicate where fees and taxes will be added to a transfer amount to better demonstrate the calculation of the total amount paid by the sender.\n        The internet address for the sample State regulatory agency is also amended on some forms with the suffix \u201c.gov\u201d rather than \u201c.com.\u201d\n        The toll-free telephone numbers for the Bureau have also been added to some forms.",
                "As discussed above, Model Forms A-38 through A-41 may be used when disclosures are required to be disclosed in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements in \u00a7 1005.31(g). The Board proposed model disclosures in Spanish to facilitate compliance with this foreign language requirement and requested comment on the disclosures. One commenter submitted spelling, grammar and verb tense revisions to the Spanish language disclosures. The commenter believed the Spanish language disclosures, as proposed, did not adequately communicate the intent of the language used in the English disclosures.",
                "Certain commenter-suggested revisions have been made in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 to correct inaccuracies in the proposed Spanish language disclosures. However, in other instances, the suggested revisions have not been made. Although the proposed language and the commenter-suggested revisions reflected stylistic variations, both contained accurate translations of the English language model forms. Therefore, the technical corrections are included in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 in the final rule. The Bureau also made stylistic changes to the Spanish language model forms that it believes better tracks the language in the English language disclosures."

The Board solicited comment in the May 2011 Proposed Rule on whether an effective date of one year from the date the final rule is published, or an alternative effective date would be appropriate.",
                        "One industry commenter agreed that 12 months would be an appropriate time period to implement the remittance transfer provisions. However, several other industry commenters recommended that the effective date of the final rule be set 18 to 24 months from the date that the final rule is issued. In suggesting this time period, money transmitter commenters stated that they would need time to change hardware printers and software. Agents of remittance transfer providers would also need time to integrate software from the remittance transfer provider with their point of sale systems. Industry commenters also requested time to deplete their existing form stock, develop and implement proper training programs, and amend contracts with agent locations worldwide.",

These commenters also stated they would need time to: Complete processing system modifications; develop disclosures, operating procedures, marketing and employee training materials; and make modifications to agreements with correspondents and other intermediaries. They further requested that the Bureau take into account other regulatory requirement set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act that financial institutions must implement in addition to the remittance transfer provisions.",

In setting this effective date, the Bureau believes that this time frame best balances the significant consumer protection interests addressed by this rule against industry's need to make systems changes to comply with the final rule. Therefore, the disclosure requirements in \u00a7 1005.31 will apply to remittance transfers that are requested by a sender on or after the effective date.

Specifically, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have contrasted the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii would have revised the reference to taxes imposed by a foreign government to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, and the proposed commentary would have built on the existing guidance regarding applicable recipient institution fees to clarify that account fees are not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iv additionally would have explained that a fee that specifically relates to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to on the remittance transfer itself.  Proposed 31(b)(1)-1.v would have provided that the terms used to describe the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes.",

                "To clarify what the Bureau means by account number and recipient institution identifier, the Bureau is also adopting new comment 33(a)-8.  Comment 33(a)-8 states that, for purposes of the exception in \u00a7 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, ISO 9362 or 13616 codes (including International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Business Identifier Codes (BICs)) and other similar account or institution identifiers.  In addition, for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account refers only to an account held in the recipient's name at a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution that maintains savings or checking accounts or accounts used for the purchase or sale of securities.  An account for purposes of this definition is not limited to accounts held by consumers.  For the reasons discussed above, the comment states that the term does not, however, refer to a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile phone company that is not a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution.",

        "88":"Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.",

Code \u00a7 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under \u00a7 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.",
        "80":"See 76 FR 29923.",
        "81":"See \u00a7 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. See \u00a7 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).",
        "86":"12 CFR 1005.18.",
        "87":"Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.",
        "84":"As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.",

See comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.",
        "76":"Due to a scrivener's error, \u00a7 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term \u201cOther Transfer Fees,\u201d \u201cOther Transfer Taxes,\u201d or \u201cOther Transfer Fees and Taxes,\u201d or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term \u201cOther Fees and Taxes.\u201d The terms set forth in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.",

        "78":"As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.",

        "12":"A futures contract for foreign currency is a contract between two parties to purchase a specified amount of foreign currency at a date in the future for a price agreed upon at the time of contracting. Such contracts would allow a provider to \u201clock-in\u201d a rate in order for it to give customers an accurate rate when scheduling the transfer.",
        "15":"In the February Proposal, the Bureau did propose conforming changes to comment 32(c)(3)-1 that referenced the renumbered provisions relating to the permanent exception for transfers to certain countries (what is \u00a7 1005.32(b)(1) in the final rule). The Bureau received no comments on the proposed changes to this comment, and the Bureau is adopting it as proposed.",
        "14":"For the same reasons, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed change to comment 32(c)(1)-1, concerning potential transmittal routes or proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 concerned fees imposed on the remittance transfer provider by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau received no comments regarding comment 32(b)(2)-1. Nevertheless, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed comment because it is duplicative. See \u00a7 1005.32(a) and (b)(2)(ii). The final rule continues, in effect, to allow estimates for the fees described in \u00a7 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in two circumstances: (i) Where the fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient pursuant to \u00a7 1005.32(b)(2)(ii); or (ii) where an \u201cinsured institution\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1005.32(a)(3) is permitted to estimate fees under the temporary exception in \u00a7 1005.32(a).",
        "16":"Section 1005.32(c)(1) contains three methodologies for providing estimates. If a provider chooses to use a non-listed method, \u00a7 1005.32(c) explains that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater then, the estimated amount disclosed to the sender."
