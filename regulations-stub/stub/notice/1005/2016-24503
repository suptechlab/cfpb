                "The Bureau proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) that when a financial institution provides disclosures in compliance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) and discloses the fee schedules of multiple service plans together on one form, the fees that would have been required to be listed pursuant proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7) that vary among service plans must be generally grouped together, and the fees that are the same across all service plans must be grouped together. See proposed Model Form A-10(f). Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) would have further stated that if the periodic fee varies between service plans, the financial institution must use the term \u201cplan fee,\u201d or a substantially similar term when disclosing the periodic fee for each service plan. The Bureau believed that, when a financial institution chooses to disclose multiple service plans together on one short form, it would be most useful for a consumer to see all the fees that vary among plans grouped together to more easily compare the different plans. The Bureau sought comment on whether this grouping distinction for short forms that include multiple service plans makes sense.",
                "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) also would have stated that when providing disclosures for multiple service plans on one short form in compliance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1), the incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8) must be grouped with the fees that are the same across all service plans. The Bureau believed that since a financial institution would have to consider total incidence across all plans when determining its incidence-based fee disclosure to comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8), it made sense that these fees would be grouped with the fees that are the same across all service plans.",
                "The Bureau received comments from industry and consumer groups regarding the multiple service plan short form generally, which are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B) above. Most relevant to this provision were the comments from several consumer groups that urged the Bureau to eliminate the multiple service plan short form disclosure. The Bureau did not receive any comments, however, specific to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(C).",
                "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(C), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(C), with substantial modifications to reflect the redesigned short form for multiple service plans as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B) above.",

Similar to the grouping requirements in the short form and long form disclosures, the final rule's grouping requirements for short form disclosures for multiple service plans conform to the principle of grouping fees together and grouping other information together. Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(C) requires that when providing a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2), in lieu of the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(A) for grouping of the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) and (v) through (ix), the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) be grouped together and provided in that order.

Finally, the Bureau has added new comments 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-1 and-2 to provide guidance regarding the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(B).",
                        "First, the final rule addresses the grouping requirement for new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i), the title or heading for the long form disclosure. The final rule provides that the information required by new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i) be located in the first line of the long form disclosure.",
                        "The final rule, like the proposed rule, generally requires that like categories be grouped together in the long form disclosure. Regarding the disclosure in the long form of all fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed, the final rule, like the proposed rule, requires that the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) be generally grouped together and organized under subheadings by the category of function for which a financial institution may impose the fee.",
                        "While the proposed rule would have required that text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table directly to the right of the numeric fee amount disclosed, the final rule relaxes this requirement. In the final rule, the text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(A) in close proximity to the fee amount. The Bureau continues to believe that disclosing fees in categories will aid consumers in navigating the long form disclosure which, with the disclosure of all of a prepaid account's fees, could be much longer than the short form disclosure and will benefit from such organization. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions currently organize the fees schedules in their prepaid account agreements in this manner. With regard to the change to \u201cclose proximity\u201d in the final rule, the Bureau believes that, while the short form disclosure necessitates stricter requirements to achieve more precise standardization, financial institutions should have more discretion in the long form. To this end, the sample form for the long form disclosure, as opposed to the model forms for the short form disclosures, serves as an example of a disclosure structure financial institutions may emulate or use to develop their own long form disclosure.",
                        "In response to the industry commenters requesting examples of the categories of function required in the long form disclosure, the Bureau directs financial institutions to the sample long form disclosure, Sample Form A-10(f). The sample form is provided as an example that financial institutions may, but are not required to, incorporate or emulate in developing their own long form disclosures. The following categories of function that appear in the sample form can serve as examples of categories that financial institutions might use in designing their long form disclosures: Get started (disclosing the purchase price), Monthly usage (disclosing the monthly fee), Add money (disclosing fees for direct deposit and cash reload), Spend money (disclosing bill payment fees), Get cash (disclosing ATM withdrawal fees), Information (disclosing customer service and ATM balance inquiry fees), Using your card outside the U.S. (disclosing fees for international transactions, international ATM withdrawals, and international ATM balance inquiries), and Other (disclosing the inactivity fee). Financial institutions may use some or all of the categories in the sample form or may create their own categories.",
                        "Regarding the statements in the long form disclosure, the rule requires that the information in the long form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iii) through (vi) be generally grouped together, provided in that order, and appear below the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii). As in the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that grouping together like categories of information here will improve readability and enhance consumer comprehension.",
                        "Finally, the final rule explains that if, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii), the financial institution includes the disclosures described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.60(e)(1), such disclosures must appear below the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vi).",
                        "New comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-1 provides an example illustrating the meaning of close proximity as used in the final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(B). The comment states that, for example, a financial institution is deemed to comply with this requirement if the text describing the conditions is located directly to the right of the fee amount in the long form disclosure, as illustrated in Sample Form A-10(f). The comment also cross-references final comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-2 regarding stacking of electronic disclosures for display on smaller screen sizes. As discussed above, that comment describes how compliance with the requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(B) may be achieved, for example, through stacking of the long form disclosure for a consumer viewing it on an electronic device with a smaller screen size.",
                        "New comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 explains how to create a subheading by category of function for any finance charges that may be imposed on a prepaid account as described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61. The comment explains that, pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), the financial institution may, but is not required to, group all finance charges together under a single subheading. The comment goes on to say that this includes situations where the financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. The comment illustrates this with an example of a financial institution that charges on the prepaid account a $0.50 per transaction fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and a $1.25 per transaction fee for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction. In this case, the financial institution is permitted to disclose the $0.50 per transaction fee under a general transactional subheading and disclose the additional $0.75 per transaction fee under a separate subheading together with any other finance charges that may be imposed on the prepaid account."

Another program manager said the rigidity of the format of the short form disclosure would limit the ability of industry to offer new types of prepaid cards. Two industry trade associations said the rule was unclear regarding the extent to which a financial institution could depart from the format of the required disclosures.

                        "The Bureau is adopting the proposed grouping requirements for the short form disclosure essentially as proposed. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau designed the top line of the short form disclosure to direct consumers' attention to what it believes are the most important fees for consumers to know in advance of acquiring a prepaid account. With regard to the statement regarding wage or salary payment options required for payroll card account (and government benefit account) short form disclosures, the Bureau believes that consumers understanding that their job (or government benefit) is not contingent upon their acceptance of the payroll card (or government benefit card) is of paramount importance in the short form disclosure. As in the proposed rule, the final rule generally groups fees together and non-fee information together. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule also groups together the statements regarding fees that can vary, including new provisions \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii) (variable fee disclosure for the periodic fee) and \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) (State-required information or other fee discounts and waivers for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts).",

To more effectively connect the fee section with the statement regarding the number of additional fee types, required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), the Bureau relocated this statement to the fee section. Finally, the new statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) directing consumers to the disclosure of additional fee types required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) is located immediately after the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged and immediately before the disclosure of any actual additional fee types.",

                        "In response to comments generally addressing the format and formatting requirements of the short form and long form disclosures, the Bureau states that those requirements, together with the content requirements for the disclosures, were designed to create companion disclosures intended to facilitate consumers' prepaid account purchase and use decisions. The Bureau intended these disclosures to play very different but complementary roles and, thus, purposefully gave them different formats. The abridged nature of the short form, with its emphasis on key fees and information, versus the comprehensive nature of the long form, with its requirement to disclose, among other things, all fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed, require different formats that together create a synergistic whole.",
                        "Regarding the comments questioning the extent to which a financial institution could depart from the required format, financial institutions must comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in the final rule but the Bureau notes that the regulatory text and commentary contain additional information and direction clarifying specific requirements in the final rule, including a number of optional modifications. Also the Bureau is providing the model and sample forms to provide concrete illustrations of the requirements under the rule.\n          For examples of short form disclosures that comply with the grouping requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(A), see Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). Model Forms A-10(a) and (b) illustrate the grouping requirements specifically for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, respectively. Model Forms A-10(c) and (d) illustrate the grouping requirements for short form disclosures in general, including those sold in retail locations.

The Bureau believed that many consumers regularly have issues with their prepaid accounts that require talking to a customer service agent by telephone. The Bureau also believed that some providers impose fees for making such a call. Additionally, several participants in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing reported having incurred such customer service fees. For these reasons, the Bureau believed that the short form disclosure should include this fee, and thus proposed to include it. The Bureau noted that this disclosure would have been required even if the financial institution did not charge such a fee pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1.",
                "No commenters opposed inclusion of customer service fees in the short form disclosure. Instead of disclosing the single highest customer service fee, an issuing bank and several consumer groups recommended disclosing either the fee for both live agent and interactive voice response (IVR) customer service or just the IVR fee. They said otherwise customers may be misled into thinking the disclosed fee includes the cost of a call to an IVR customer service, which generally is free. An office of a State Attorney General recommended that the Bureau ban customer service fees for payroll card accounts because such fees chill inquiry into fraudulent or erroneous charges, but it otherwise supported the disclosure.",

The Bureau continues to believe that it is important to require disclosure of this fee because consumers regularly have issues or questions that require contact with the financial institution's customer service department, but the fee is not so common as to merit disclosure in the top line of the short form.",
                "The Bureau is adopting the final rule with a notable change from the proposal. The Bureau agrees with commenters that it is beneficial for consumers to specifically be alerted to the generally free or less expensive IVR method of customer service, and thus is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi) requiring disclosure in the short form of fees for both automated and live agent customer service. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, consistent with several commenters' observations, disclosure of a general customer service fee resulted in many participants incorrectly assuming the fee would remain the same whether the service was live or automated, while all participants understood the distinction when both automated and live agent customer service fees were disclosed.\n        Similarly, when a short form disclosed a fee for \u201clive customer service,\u201d all participants understood that the fee would apply if they spoke to a live customer service agent and that the fee would not be charged if they used the automated customer service system to get information about their accounts.\n        However, because the structure of the multiple service plan short form permitted pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) does not have sufficient room to disclose both automated and live customer service fees on separate lines, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi) states that a financial institution using the multiple service plan short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) must disclose only the fee for live customer service. The Bureau believes that disclosing the live customer service fee is preferable to disclosing the automated fee because of the potential cost to the consumer, as the Bureau understands that automated customer service is typically provided at no cost to the consumer. Finally, the Bureau has made other technical modifications to this provision for clarity. Regarding the request that the Bureau ban customer service fees for payroll card accounts, such a request is outside the scope of this rulemaking."

Rather than relying on a single broad umbrella definition, the Bureau has concluded in response to commenters' concerns about ambiguity as to the scope of coverage that it would provide greater clarity to specify several types of products that are included within the general definition of prepaid account, and then specify an additional, narrower category for the balance of covered products by reference to those products' functionality. Accordingly, the final rule has been reorganized to list the specific categories of products first.

Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that because there are certain provisions of Regulation E that would remain specific to payroll card accounts, it was appropriate to propose to maintain the term payroll card account as a standalone sub-definition of prepaid account. Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii) would have provided that the term \u201cprepaid account\u201d included a \u201cpayroll card account,\u201d and would have restated the existing payroll card account definition.",
                "In addition, the Bureau proposed to renumber existing comment 2(b)-2, which concerns certain employment-related cards not covered as payroll card accounts, as comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau proposed to add to comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 an explanation that would have clarified that, while the existing examples given of cards would not be payroll card accounts (i.e., cards used solely to disburse incentive-based payments, such as bonuses, disbursements unrelated to compensation, and cards used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations where other payment methods are unavailable), such cards could constitute prepaid accounts generally, provided the other conditions of the definition of that term in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) were satisfied. Similar to existing comment 2(b)-2, proposed comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 would have also stated that all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account or prepaid account were covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involved payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction did not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.",
                "The Bureau did not receive any comments on this portion of the proposal, and as such, is finalizing the regulatory text and commentary largely as proposed, with minor modifications in the commentary for clarity and consistency with terms used elsewhere in this final rule.\n        To accommodate several substantive changes to the definition of prepaid account, however, the Bureau has renumbered several sub-sections of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3), including \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii) and its related commentary.

In addition, these commenters, as well as several labor organizations, urged the Bureau to require free access to balance information at a terminal for all prepaid accounts. They explained that terminals are convenient and easy to use, especially for non-English speakers and consumers who have difficulty navigating an automated menu over the telephone. These commenters also noted that terminals provide account balances in real-time and are valuable to consumers with limited telephone and internet access.",
                        "Several consumer groups also argued that imposing fees to access balance information at a terminal discourages consumers, especially those experiencing financial hardship, from monitoring transactions and exercising their error resolution rights under Regulation E. These commenters noted that paying for such access is especially difficult for consumers who are already experiencing financial hardship and that consumers generally do not expect to be charged for checking their balance information. They suggested that the cost of providing balance information at a terminal is minimal and should be bundled with the cost of withdrawals. However, one program manager challenged this point, arguing that access to balance information at a terminal is the most expensive method to check account balances because these transactions would likely generate a cost to merchants and networks that would likely then be assessed back to financial institutions. Another program manager urged the Bureau not to require access to balance information at a terminal given the costs to industry, and a credit union specifically requested that financial institutions not be required to provide access to balance information by both telephone and at a terminal.",
                        "One industry commenter requested that the Bureau allow online access to a digital wallet account balance as an alternative to providing access via a readily accessible telephone line.

In addition, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions already provide balance information by telephone. Notwithstanding the consumer benefits of accessing balance information at a terminal, the Bureau does not believe that requiring such access for all prepaid accounts justifies the additional costs to industry at this time, given that consumers can obtain balance information through other, less expensive methods. The Bureau also declines to exempt digital wallets that are prepaid accounts from the requirement to provide balance information by telephone under the periodic statement alternative, as requested by one commenter, because balance information should be accessible by telephone in the event online access to such information is unavailable.",

One commenter, a trade association, specifically suggested that the Bureau modify the definition to only apply to products that are expressly marketed and labeled as \u201cprepaid.\u201d The Bureau agrees that the addition of a provision focusing on marketing and labeling would provide greater clarity. The Bureau believes that all or most GPR cards are currently marketed or labeled as \u201cprepaid,\u201d either on the packaging or display of the card or in related advertising. As such, the Bureau believes that most, if not all, GPR cards will qualify as prepaid accounts under this provision of the definition. In addition, the Bureau believes that, in order to prevent consumer confusion and conform to consumer expectations, accounts that are marketed or labeled as \u201cprepaid\u201d should be accompanied by the same disclosures and protections that consumers will expect prepaid accounts to provide pursuant to this final rule.",

The Bureau is clarifying, therefore, that in order to qualify as a prepaid account under the \u201cmarketed or labeled\u201d prong, an account must also be redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs. Accordingly, although products such as prepaid phone cards are marketed or labeled as \u201cprepaid,\u201d they would not qualify as prepaid accounts under this prong because they are not redeemable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants or usable at ATMs.",

The comment further clarifies that an account may be marketed or labeled as prepaid if the financial institution, its service provider, including a program manager, or the payment network on which an access device for the account is used, promotes or advertises, or contracts with another party to promote or advertise, the account using the label \u201cprepaid.\u201d Finally, the comment clarifies that a product or service that is marketed or labeled as prepaid is not a \u201cprepaid account\u201d if it does not otherwise meet the definition of account in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(1)."

The proposal stated the provision was intended to capture regular maintenance fees that a financial institution levies on a consumer solely for having a prepaid account for a period of time, whether the fee is charged monthly, annually, or for some other period of time. A financial institution could choose a label for this fee that accurately reflects the relevant periodic interval. Pursuant to the formatting requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4), a financial institution would have been required to disclose this fee in the top line of the short form disclosure.",
                        "The proposal set forth the following reasons for the Bureau's proposed requirement that financial institutions disclose the presence or absence of a periodic fee as the first item in the short form. First, the Bureau's analysis of fee data indicated that many prepaid accounts charge a recurring fee, typically on a monthly basis. Second, the Bureau believed a periodic fee is one that consumers will likely pay no matter what other fees they incur because it is imposed for maintaining the prepaid account, unless a financial institution offers a way for a consumer to avoid that fee (e.g., through the receipt of a regular direct deposit or maintaining a certain average daily account balance). Those prepaid accounts that do not assess a periodic fee often charge other fees instead, typically per purchase fees.\n          The Bureau therefore believed that the lack of a periodic fee is also an important feature of a prepaid account that should be included in the top line to allow consumers to more easily identify this trade-off between periodic fees and per purchase fees. Third, the Bureau believed that the existence of a monthly fee (or lack thereof) is typically a key factor in a consumer's decision about whether to acquire a particular prepaid account. Additionally, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing showed that participants frequently cited periodic fees as one of the most important factors influencing their decision about which prepaid account to acquire."

As noted in the proposal and above, in many instances, prepaid accounts may have certain fees that vary depending on how a consumer uses the account. The proposal gave the example of monthly periodic fees that are, for some prepaid account programs, waived when a consumer receives direct deposit or when the monthly balance exceeds a certain amount. The Bureau was concerned that in some instances, these conditional situations could become complicated and difficult to explain on a short form disclosure, particularly for multiple fees. The Bureau believed that allowing multiple, complex disclaimers on a single form would be complicated and make comprehension and comparisons more difficult.",

Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have also stated that a financial institution must use the same symbol and text for all fees that could be lower, but may use any other part of the prepaid account product's packaging material or its Web site to provide more detail about how a specific fee type may be lower. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have further stated that a financial institution must not disclose any additional third-party fees imposed in connection with any of the fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (8).",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-1 would have provided examples of how to disclose variable fees on the short form disclosure in accordance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C). The proposed comment would have also clarified that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) does not permit a financial institution to explain the conditions under which a fee may be lower, but a financial institution could use any other part of the prepaid account product's packaging material or may use its Web site to disclose that information. That information would also have been required to be disclosed in the long form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-2 would have explained that third parties could include service providers and other entities, regardless of whether the entity is an agent of the financial institution. The Bureau believed that, regardless of whether a third party has a relationship with the financial institution, no additional fees should be disclosed on the short form.",
                        "The Bureau recognized that its proposed approach to the disclosure of variable fees on the short form could potentially obscure some complexity in a prepaid account's fee structure.

The Bureau believed that the proposed short form disclosure\u2014and the requirement to disclose the highest fee with an indication that the fee may be lower in certain circumstances\u2014would allow consumers to know the maximum they will pay for that fee type while indicating to consumers when they could qualify for a lower fee."

                        "Comments regarding disclosure of variable fees. A number of industry commenters, including industry trade associations, program managers, issuing banks, a payment network, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, as well as several State government agencies and a think tank, recommended that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose the highest fee for a fee that varies in favor of more fulsome disclosure of the price variations for that fee. They said disclosing the highest fee, with a symbol linked to a statement explaining that the fee may be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, would mislead consumers by failing to provide them with information critical to making meaningful decisions, such as more detailed information within the short form on how they can take advantage of fee waivers and discounts. Some industry commenters said it would be counterintuitive for consumers to check other areas of the packaging for such discounts and pointed to confusion over the asterisk in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as indicating the Bureau's proposed system would not work. One trade association added that required disclosure of the highest fee would restrict fee models and limit innovation.",
                        "Many of these industry commenters recommended alternatives to disclosure of the highest fee, such as permitting disclosure in the short form of the full variation of fees or requiring disclosure of the highest fee only if the issuer chooses not to disclose the fee variations. Others recommended disclosing the most common, highest and lowest, lower end, median, or a range of fees. Some recommended disclosing a graphic showing the proportion of consumers paying the highest fee or permitting a de minimis exception allowing disclosure of a lower fee if that lower price is within a close range of the highest fee. Two consumer groups specifically addressed this portion of the proposal, praising the Bureau for the short form disclosure's balance between simplicity and completeness, and saying that too much information reduces consumer understanding. One of the commenters stated that it is important for the consumer to know the highest fee, that financial institutions have alternative places to highlight how to avoid a higher fee, and that disclosing the highest fee also encourages consumers to turn to the long form disclosure to find out about fee waivers and discounts. The other consumer group commenter stated that the required disclosure of the highest fee may encourage lowering fees but could also mislead consumers regarding the actual cost of a feature, particularly with regard to the cash reload fee, suggesting that the required disclosure of the highest fee may provide an incentive to industry to eliminate discounts, such as waiver of the periodic fee with direct deposit. This commenter suggested that the Bureau monitor and assess the impact of requiring disclosure of the highest fee.",
                        "Several industry commenters, including an issuing bank and a trade association specifically recommended permitting inclusion in the short form disclosure of the conditions under which the monthly fee could be waived, citing the importance of this fee and the prevalence of discounts and waivers applicable to this fee as crucial to consumer decisions in choosing a prepaid card. A consumer group said its research showed that 14 of 66 prepaid cards disclose that the monthly fee can be waived entirely if the consumer takes certain actions.",
                        "Comments regarding single disclosure of like fees. Some commenters recommended permitting a single disclosure in the short form in place of required two-tier fees, i.e., those provisions requiring disclosure of two fee variations under a single fee or fee type, when the fee amount is the same for both fees. As noted above, two trade associations, an issuing bank, and the office of a State Attorney General made this recommendation specifically for the per purchase fee disclosure that would have been required under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) (final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) requires disclosure of a single per purchase fee) and a program manager made this recommendation for the ATM withdrawal fees under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(3).",
                        "Comments regarding disclosure of third-party fees. Several industry commenters, including issuing banks and an industry trade association commented on the Bureau's proposal to prohibit the disclosure of third-party fees in the short form. The trade association and two issuing banks generally recommended against mandating disclosure of third-party fees as impractical because, they said, the amount of the fees and the timing and frequency of changes to the fees is often outside the control of the financial institution. Specifically regarding the short form, they recommended permitting a general disclaimer regarding third-party fees or an example to show when such a fee may occur. Another issuing bank recommended that third-party fees should be permitted, but not required, to be disclosed in the short form. Comments related to disclosure of third-party fees in the short form specifically for cash reloads are addressed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iv) above. In that particular circumstance, some commenters expressed concern that failing to reflect third-party fees in connection with the proposed disclosure of the cash reload fee in the short form might create consumer confusion given that it is a standard industry practice for reload network providers or third-party retailers, not the financial institutions that issue prepaid accounts, to provide and charge for the reloading of cash into prepaid accounts. In addition to confusing consumers, commenters suggested this outcome would result in a competitive disadvantage for financial institutions that offer proprietary systems, which are usually less expensive than third-party systems, and thereby dissuade financial institutions from offering this service.",
                        "Comments regarding disclosure of finance charges. Although the Bureau did not specifically solicit comment on disclosure in the short form of finance charges, several consumer group commenters addressed this issue in their comments regarding the proposed statement on overdraft credit features. As discussed above, these consumer groups recommended that the Bureau require disclosure in the short form of the actual fees charged for overdraft credit features, which one consumer group said would otherwise permit the issuer to hide the ball by calling such fees by other names. The Bureau received no comments from industry specifically about disclosure of finance charges in the short form disclosure."

The linked statement must be located above the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x). As discussed in more detail below, final rule \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii) provides an alternative for periodic fees disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) where a financial institution can disclose either the asterisk statement pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i) or can disclose specific information about fee waiver or reduction for the periodic fee.",
                        "As discussed above in connection with the periodic fee disclosure under \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i), the Bureau acknowledges the concerns expressed by commenters regarding the need to provide more information about how such fees can vary. However, for the reasons discussed below, the Bureau believes that providing the same level of tailoring and detail with regard to all other fees on the short form would substantially increase the complexity of the form and decrease its usefulness to consumers as an introductory overview of account pricing. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the best balance is to allow more flexibility with regard to periodic fees while maintaining the proposal's approach to variations in other fees. The Bureau continues to believe that information on fee variations for all other fees could not be disclosed in a manner that is both engaging and comprehensible to consumers. The design of the short form disclosure seeks a balance between the disclosure of key information necessary for consumer purchase and use decisions and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and engagement. Incorporating into the short form disclosure multiple complex disclaimers, often featuring a variety of conditions under which consumers may receive fee waivers or discounts or obtain fee waivers or discounts for a certain time period, would disrupt this balance.",
                        "Further, many of the alternatives recommended by commenters, such as disclosing a range of fees or using a graphic to show the proportion of consumers paying the highest fees, posed a degree of complexity the Bureau also believes would disrupt this balance. In addition, as opposed to alternatives recommended by commenters such as disclosing the median, lowest, or most common fee, the Bureau believes, as stated in the proposal, it is paramount for consumers to know the maximum they could pay for a particular fee. In this way, consumers will not be surprised by being charged fees higher than they expected and, as pointed out by a consumer group commenter, the linked statement can incent consumers to turn to other sources to learn about available discounts and waivers. As the Bureau explained in the proposal, financial institutions have the alternative of explaining these fee variations elsewhere, such as on other parts of the packaging or on their Web sites. In addition, financial institutions must disclose these details in the long form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii), discussed below. The Bureau believes that once the standardized short form disclosure is used by all prepaid account programs, it will not be counterintuitive, as asserted by some industry commenters, to look outside of its contours for additional information like fee waivers and discounts.",
                        "In response to the consumer group commenter raising concerns and recommending that the Bureau monitor and assess the impact of requiring disclosure of the highest fee, the Bureau notes that the commenters' concerns regarding disclosure of periodic fees and fees for cash reloads are specifically addressed in the final rule, respectively, by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii) and (v). Also, the Bureau intends to continue to monitor the issues addressed in this rule, including disclosure of the highest fee.",
                        "In response to the industry commenter citing to the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as indicating that the proposed system for disclosing fee variation with an asterisk linked to a generic statement that fees could be lower would confuse consumers, the cited testing actually revealed the opposite: Participants were confused by multiple asterisks linked to the details of fee variations for specific fees. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing supports adoption of the proposed system in that, although some misconceptions persisted, most participants understood the significance of the presence or absence of the asterisk when linked to fees other than the monthly fee.",
                        "As discussed above, some commenters recommended that the Bureau permit fuller fee disclosure in the short form for waivers and discounts of the monthly fee. The Bureau recognizes that the monthly fee is a key fee and is one of the most commonly waived or discounted prepaid account fees. The Bureau understands such waivers and discounts are based on the consumer meeting one or a combination of the following conditions: Having direct deposit into the prepaid account, making a set number of transactions per month, or loading a minimum amount of money per month into the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau followed up on this issue in its post-proposal consumer testing. In addition to an asterisk linking the highest fees to a statement indicating the fee can be lower depending on how and where the card is used, the Bureau also tested adding a dagger symbol (\u2020) after the highest fee disclosed for the periodic fee, linked to an additional line of text located above the asterisked statement, describing variations in the monthly fee due to waivers and discounts when certain conditions are met.\n          The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing examined participant comprehension of various versions of the language and in various scenarios.\n          Most participants who saw the form with the dagger language correctly linked the dagger to the associated text and understood that the circumstances under which the monthly fee could be waived and most participants who saw the form with only the generic asterisk language linked to the monthly fee correctly linked the asterisk to the associated text and understood the monthly fee could be lower in some situations.\n          Thus, regardless of the version shown, all participants understood that the monthly fee could be waived in some situations, and all were able to correctly identify those situations.",
                        "The primacy of the periodic fee, prevalence of fee variations associated with the periodic fee, successful consumer testing of disclosure of fee variation for the monthly fee, and both industry and consumer group comments suggesting particular consideration regarding disclosure of the periodic fee have led the Bureau to adopt new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii), which permits financial institutions an alternative disclosure for a periodic fee that may vary. Specifically, if the amount of the periodic fee disclosed in the short form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) could vary, as an alternative to the disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i), the financial institution may disclose the highest amount it may impose for the periodic fee, followed by a symbol, such as a dagger, that is different from the symbol the financial institution uses pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i), to indicate that a waiver of the fee or a lower fee might apply, linked to a statement in one additional line of text disclosing the waiver or reduced fee amount and explaining the circumstances under which the fee waiver or reduction may occur. The linked statement must be located directly above or in place of the linked statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i), as applicable.",
                        "The Bureau believes that this optional addition to the short form disclosure will help consumers better understand nuances regarding this important fee without serious compromise to the overall integrity of the short form design, especially in light of the reduction of information disclosed in the short form pursuant to the final rule. See, e.g., removal of two-tiered fees from \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii), reduction of three incidence-based fees to two additional fee types disclosed pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), and permitted single disclosure for like fees pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii).",

The comment also explains that, except as described in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii), final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i) does not permit a financial institution to describe in the short form disclosure the specific conditions under which a fee may be reduced or waived, but the financial institution could use, for example, any other part of the prepaid account's packaging or other printed materials to disclose that information. The comment also explains that the conditions under which a fee may be lower are required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii).",

The Bureau believes that permitting disclosure of a single fee amount for a two-tier fee disclosure where the same fee is charged for both variations creates efficiency by simplifying and shortening the short form disclosure without sacrificing consumer comprehension. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that, for example, participants shown a short form with a single ATM withdrawal fee seemed to understand that the company providing the prepaid account would not charge different fees depending on what network the cardholder used."

Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iv) states that, except as provided in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(v) with regard to cash reload fees, a financial institution may not include any third-party fees in a disclosure made pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2). New comment 18(b)(3)(iv)-1 explains that fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iv). For example, if a program manager performs customer service functions for a financial institution's prepaid account program, and charges a fee for live agent customer service, that fee must be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iv).",

In response to the comments recommending that additional information or disclaimers be provided in the short form with regard to third-party fees, the Bureau believes that the abridged nature of the short form disclosure cannot accommodate disclosing all variable and third-party fees and that the comprehensive design of the long form disclosure is better suited to inform consumers about the details of fee variations and third-party fees. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) below.",

This requirement is principally set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iv), and is supplemented by new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(v). Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(v) provides that any third-party fee included in the cash reload fee disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iv) must be the highest fee known by the financial institution at the time it prints, or otherwise prepares, the short form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2). A financial institution is not required to revise its short form disclosure to reflect a cash reload fee change by a third party until such time that the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the short form disclosure. Thus, whether for a prepaid account program with packaging material or for one with only online or oral disclosures, the financial institution must update the short form to disclose a third-party cash reload fee change when it otherwise updates its short form disclosure. New comment 18(b)(3)(v)-1 provides several examples illustrating when a financial institution must update its short form disclosure to reflect a change in a third-party cash reload fee.",

However, the Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to require financial institutions to reprint or otherwise reissue their short form disclosures whenever a third party changes its fees for cash reloads, as the financial institution may not always have control over when a third party changes its fees. Rather, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require financial institutions to update the disclosure of these third-party fees when the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new packaging materials or until such time that the financial institution otherwise updates the short form disclosure."

                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 would have explained what a provider should disclose on the short form when fees are inapplicable to a particular prepaid account product or are $0. Specifically, the proposed comment would have said that the disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) must always be provided prior to prepaid account acquisition, even when a particular disclosure is not applicable to a specific prepaid account. The proposed comment would have also provided an example that if a financial institution does not charge a fee to a consumer for withdrawing money at an ATM in the financial institution's network or an affiliated network, which is a type of fee that would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(3), the financial institution should list \u201cATM withdrawal (in network)\u201d on the short form disclosure and list \u201c$0\u201d as the fee. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 would have further clarified, however, that if the financial institution does not allow a consumer to withdraw money from ATMs that are in the financial institution's network or from those in an affiliated network, it should still list \u201cATM withdrawal (in-network)\u201d and \u201cATM withdrawal (out-of-network)\u201d on the short form disclosure and state \u201cnot offered\u201d or \u201cN/A.\u201d The Bureau believed it important that the static portion of the short form disclosure list identical account features and fee types across all prepaid account products, to create standardization in order to enable consumers to quickly determine and compare the potential cost of certain offered features.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-2 to further explain how to disclose fees and features on the short form disclosure.

The proposed comment would have clarified, however, that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8) would have required the disclosure of up to three additional fee types. Finally, the proposed comment would have provided the example that, if a financial institution offers more than one method for loading cash into a prepaid account, only the fee for the method that will charge the highest fee should be disclosed, and the financial institution may use an asterisk or other symbol next to the cash reload fee disclosed to indicate that the fee may be lower. Finally, the proposed comment would have provided a cross-reference to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-1.",
                        "As the Bureau explained in the proposal, the Bureau believed that simplicity and clarity are important goals for the short form disclosure, particularly in light of the space constraints imposed in retail settings. Insofar as allowing complicated explanations and multiple different fees to be disclosed for a particular feature could disrupt those goals, the Bureau thus proposed that for most fees on the short form, a financial institution only be permitted to list one fee\u2014the highest fee a consumer could incur for a particular activity. The Bureau noted that these limitations would only apply to the short form disclosure; the financial institution could use any other portion of the packaging material or Web site to disclose other relevant fees at its discretion, and would be required to disclose the other variations on the long form.",
                        "The Bureau also believed there was particular value in maintaining simplicity on the short form by limiting the top-line portion of the form in order to encourage consumer engagement with the disclosure. Thus, the Bureau proposed to require only four fee types in the top line. For two of those fee types\u2014per purchase fees and ATM withdrawal fees\u2014the Bureau also proposed to require disclosure of two fee values. The Bureau believed that it is important to include two per purchase fees\u2014a per purchase fee when a consumer uses a signature and a per purchase fee when a consumer uses a PIN\u2014because consumers could potentially incur these fees every time they use their prepaid accounts, and the fee could vary depending on how a consumer completes the transaction. The Bureau believed including two per purchase fees would highlight for consumers that the fees for completing a transaction using a PIN versus the fee for using a signature could differ. Similarly, the Bureau believed that it is important to include two ATM withdrawal fees in order to highlight that fees for in-network and out-of-network transactions may differ and to signal to consumers that the product's ATM network may have an impact on the fee incurred, which could lead a consumer to seek out more information about the relevant network. The Bureau noted that in its pre-proposal consumer testing, some participants were confused about the meaning of an ATM network.",
                        "By contrast, the Bureau proposed to allow only one periodic fee and one cash reload fee to be listed in the top line of the short form. The Bureau acknowledged that both of these fees might also vary based, for example, on how often a consumer uses a prepaid account or the method used to reload cash into a prepaid account. Despite this possibility for variation, however, the Bureau believed consumers would benefit more from immediately seeing the two ways the per purchase and ATM withdrawal fees may vary."

Conversely, two consumer groups, a program manager, and an issuing bank supported the disclosure of inapplicable fees as providing a quick and accurate basis for comparison across prepaid accounts. Another program manager and issuing bank both supported the disclosure of inapplicable fees but recommended requiring \u201cnot applicable\u201d instead of \u201cN/A\u201d to clarify to consumers that the service itself, not the fee, is inapplicable. One of the consumer groups said \u201cN/A\u201d was confusing and recommended disclosing \u201cnot offered\u201d instead.",
                        "One issuing bank and an industry trade association recommended against disclosing when no fee is charged. The bank recommended this specifically for the fees that do not appear in the top line because it said they are not commonly charged and the space in the short form could be used for more commonly-charged fees. The bank recommended listing the required fees if there is a charge but, if there is no charge, permitting the issuer to decide what fee to display. A program manager recommended eliminating the \u201c$0\u201d fee requirement for government benefit accounts for fees that do not apply to such accounts."

Also, for reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting revisions to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)-1. Second, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-2 regarding the number of fees to disclose, as this comment would have repeated information found elsewhere in the final regulatory text and commentary. Finally, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)-2 regarding the prohibition on disclosure of finance charges in the short form.",
                        "The Bureau has made both substantive and technical modifications to comment 18(b)(2)-1 to clarify the explanation and examples in the proposed comment that required fees must always be disclosed in the short form\u2014even when the financial institution does not charge a fee or does not offer the feature, in which case the financial institution would disclose \u201c$0\u201d or \u201cN/A,\u201d respectively, as applicable. Although some commenters opposed a requirement to disclose a fee when there is no charge or the feature is not offered, the Bureau is adopting this requirement in the final rule to preserve standardization among short forms such that consumers can see when a feature is offered for free or is not offered at all to better compare prepaid accounts and inform consumer purchase and use decisions. The Bureau recognizes that many payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts do not currently charge certain fees or offer certain features required to be disclosed in the short form, but is finalizing the rule as proposed to allow consumers to compare payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts with their own prepaid accounts or prepaid accounts they may acquire to receive their benefits or wages.",
                        "The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that nearly all participants understood both \u201cN/A\u201d and \u201cnot offered\u201d when disclosed in place of a required fee for features not offered by a financial institution.\n          However, in order to achieve a greater degree of standardization across short form disclosures, the Bureau is finalizing the rule to require disclosure of \u201cN/A,\u201d but not \u201cnot offered,\u201d when a financial institution does not offer a feature for which a fee is required to be disclosed in the short form. The Bureau believes this single standardized approach is shorter, simpler, and clearer for consumers to use to compare fees and information in the short form across prepaid accounts. Thus, final comment 18(b)(2)-1 clarifies that \u201cN/A\u201d is the required disclosure when a financial institution does not offer a feature for which a fee is required to be disclosed in the short form.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)-2, which clarifies that pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not include in the short form disclosure finance charges as described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61.

However, proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I)-2 would have explained, among other things, that the price for purchasing or activating a prepaid account could be disclosed as an incidence-based fee for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I). (To qualify as an incidence-based fee under the proposal, the purchase price or activation fee would have had to be one of up to three fees, other than those disclosed as a static fee in the short form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7), that were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product.)",
                "An industry trade association recommended against requiring disclosure of the purchase price in the short form because, it said, consumers already are sufficiently alerted to its display on the packaging of the prepaid account or by the retailer. An issuing bank, on the other hand, recommended disclosure of the purchase price in the short form because, it said, consumers lack clarity on this fee in certain situations, such as when confronted with hundreds of prepaid cards in some retail settings. Several industry commenters, including an issuing bank, a program manager, and a trade association, recommended requiring disclosure of the activation fee instead of the purchase price. Several industry commenters recommended against requiring disclosure of the activation fee in the short form as an incidence-based fee because, they said, it is not a common fee and would be disclosed in the terms and conditions for the prepaid account. They suggested the activation fee be added as a static fee to the short form, perhaps in lieu of one of the incidence-based fees, if the Bureau's research indicated the fee was common enough. Otherwise, they recommended it be disclosed only in the long form.",
                "A consumer group agreed that the purchase price should not be disclosed in the short form as a static fee because it would take up scarce space when there is no fee (such as for online purchases of prepaid accounts), the purchase price can be conspicuously disclosed on other parts of the packaging, consumers already take notice of the price they have to pay for a prepaid card, and it is a one-time fee such that disclosing it within the short form would overemphasize it and mislead consumers to compare it with recurring fees. It also said that, for prepaid account programs where consumers frequently buy new prepaid cards, the purchase price may appear in any case as an incidence-based fee. Conversely, a consumer group urged requiring disclosure of the purchase price and any activation fee; another consumer group specifically recommended disclosure of the purchase price as a static fee or, alternatively, as a potential incidence-based fee. In support of its recommendation, this latter commenter said its research indicated that nearly half of regular GPR users purchase new cards after exhausting their funds on their current card. Moreover, it said, being charged a purchase fee at the point of purchase does not mean the consumer understands that fee is reducing the amount of funds being loaded onto the card at purchase. It also warned that consumers could confuse the \u201cpurchase fee\u201d with the \u201cper purchase fee.\u201d Individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group recommended that the short form disclosure include the purchase price.",
                "With regard to branding, one industry commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that identification within the short form of the name of the prepaid issuer and the name of the prepaid account program would not violate the requirements of the rule.",
                "For the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) and comments 18(b)(5)-1 and -2 to address issues of the disclosure of the purchase price and activation fee as well as identification of the financial institution and the prepaid account program. The final rule requires that, at the time a financial institution provides the short form, it must also disclose the following information: the name of the financial institution; the name of the prepaid account program; the purchase price for the prepaid account, if any; and the fee for activating the prepaid account, if any. Pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(iii), short form disclosures must contain only information required or permitted under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2). Thus, the information required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) must appear outside of the confines of the short form disclosure.",
                "New \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) sets forth the required location for the above-referenced disclosures. In a setting other than a retail location, this information must be disclosed in close proximity to the short form. In a retail location, this information, other than the purchase price, must be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. In a retail location, the purchase price must be disclosed either on the exterior of or in close proximity to the prepaid account access device's packaging materials. As described in more detail below, new comment 18(b)(5)-1 clarifies the content of the disclosure and comment 18(b)(5)-2 clarifies its location, including the meaning of \u201cclose proximity.\u201d",
                "The Bureau agrees that, because the purchase price invariably is disclosed on the packaging or otherwise at the point of purchase prior to acquisition of a prepaid account, it is unnecessary to use the limited space in the short form to disclose this one-time fee as a static fee. The Bureau likewise agrees that it is unnecessary to use the limited space in the short form to disclose the activation fee as a static fee, as it is not a common fee and if charged is only incurred once. The Bureau also believes that including these fees as potential additional fee types in the disclosure under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) is neither an optimal way to alert consumers to the cost of purchasing or activating a prepaid account nor a good use of the additional fee type disclosure. Because the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be aware of this fee prior to purchase in all situations, it is requiring that the purchase price and activation fee be disclosed, but outside the short form disclosure.",
                "To ensure that consumers see the purchase price, it must be disclosed in close proximity to the short form\u2014except that in a retail location the financial institution has the option to disclose the purchase price on the exterior of the packaging for the prepaid account access device (other than in the short form) or in close proximity to the display of packaging. The Bureau understands that at present, the purchase price for prepaid accounts sold at retail is disclosed either on the exterior of the prepaid account access device's packaging or displayed near the packaging by the retailer. In an effort not to disturb this system, the Bureau is permitting disclosure of the purchase price in a retail location either on the exterior of or in close proximity to the prepaid account access device's packaging material. The Bureau believes that either location would provide consumers with ample opportunity to be alerted to a prepaid account's purchase price.",
                "While the activation fee is not a common fee, unless it is plainly disclosed prior to acquisition when it does exist, the Bureau is concerned that it likely would not be noticed by many consumers before they acquire the prepaid account. The Bureau has observed that, similar to purchase price, financial institutions that charge activation fees for prepaid accounts sold at retail often conspicuously disclose the activation fee on the front of the packaging. The Bureau believes that it is important that consumers be informed if a prepaid account they are considering charges an activation fee. The Bureau also believes that, considering that activation fees are uncommon, incurred once, and that in the current marketplace the Bureau has observed such fees disclosed on the front of the packaging in a retail setting, it is appropriate to require the disclosure outside the confines of the short form but in close proximity to it\u2014and, in retail locations, on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. The Bureau believes this requirement will more clearly apprise consumers of when the activation fee is charged and the amount of the fee.",
                "Regarding the general issue of branding, branding information is not permitted to be included within the short form. However, the Bureau recognizes the importance to both industry and consumers of connecting the short form disclosure with the prepaid account's commercial identity. The Bureau understands that it is common industry practice for financial institutions offering prepaid accounts at retail to include this information on the exterior of their packaging. The Bureau believes it is important for this information to be readily available for all prepaid programs, not just those sold at retail. For this reason, the Bureau is requiring, pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5), that the name of the financial institution and the name of the prepaid program be disclosed outside the short form but in close proximity to it or, in retail locations, on the exterior of the prepaid account access device's packaging material.",
                "New comment 18(b)(5)-1 clarifies that, in addition to the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5), a financial institution may, but is not required to, also disclose the name of the program manager or other service provider involved in the prepaid account program.",
                "New comment 18(b)(5)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the location requirement of the rule and the meaning of \u201cclose proximity.\u201d The comment explains that, for example, if a financial institution provides the short form online, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it appears on the same Web page as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution offers the prepaid account in its own branch locations and provides the short form disclosure on the exterior of its preprinted packaging materials, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if the information appears on the exterior of the packaging. If the financial institution provides written short form disclosures in a manner other than on preprinted packaging materials, such as on paper, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form if it appears on the same piece of paper as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution provides the short form disclosure orally, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it is provided immediately before or after disclosing the fees and information required pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2).",
                "Comment 18(b)(5)-2 also explains that, for prepaid accounts sold in a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) requires the information other than purchase price be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. If the purchase price, if any, is not also disclosed on the exterior of the packaging, disclosure of the purchase price on or near the sales rack or display for the packaging materials is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure."

As the Board noted in adopting the Gift Card Rule, a key difference between a general-use prepaid card and a store gift card is where the card can be used.\n          While store gift cards and gift certificates can be used at only a single merchant or an affiliated group of merchants,\n          a general-use prepaid card is defined in part under the Gift Card Rule as redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs.\n          The Bureau proposed to add \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(B), which would have stated that to qualify as a prepaid account, the card, code or other device had to be redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, usable at ATMs, or usable for P2P transfers. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-7 would have referred to existing comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2 from the Gift Card Rule for guidance regarding the meaning of the phrase multiple, unaffiliated merchants.",
                        "The Bureau believed it was appropriate to limit the definition of prepaid account to those products that consumers could use at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, at ATMs, or for P2P transfers. The Bureau noted in the proposal that a core feature of a conventional debit card is that it is usable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants and at ATMs. Insofar as a purpose of the Bureau's rulemaking on prepaid accounts is to provide comparable coverage for products with comparable functionality\u2014in this case traditional debit cards and prepaid cards\u2014the Bureau believed it was appropriate to structure the proposed definition in a way that products with similar features had the protections afforded by Regulation E. Pursuant to the proposed definition, therefore, a prepaid account would have been an account that was accepted widely at unaffiliated merchants, rather than only a single merchant or specific group of merchants, such as those located on a college campus or within a mall or defined shopping area.",
                        "Next, the Bureau recognized that prepaid products were also growing in popularity as a vehicle for consumers to transmit payments to each other or to businesses. The Bureau noted that an increasing number of products allowed consumers to make P2P or P2B payments without using a third-party branded payment network. These services may not always have wide merchant acceptance, but they do allow consumers to send money to other consumers and businesses. The Bureau proposed to add new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8 to further explain when accounts capable of P2P transfers were prepaid accounts. Specifically, the comment would have explained that a prepaid account capable of P2P transfers was an account that allowed a consumer to send funds to another consumer or business. As the comment made clear, an account could qualify as a prepaid account if it permitted P2P transfers even if it was neither redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, nor usable at ATMs. A transaction involving a store gift card would not have been a P2P transfer if it could have only been used to make payments to the merchant or affiliated group of merchants on whose behalf the card was issued."

A number of consumer groups and a trade association voiced support for the Bureau's decision to include such products in the proposal. Other industry commenters who commented on the issue either opposed coverage of products usable for P2P transfers or requested that the Bureau adopt specific carve-outs from this prong of the definition. A digital wallet provider urged the Bureau to exclude P2P products from the definition of prepaid account, arguing that P2P functionality is more similar to a closed-loop payment system than to open-loop GPR cards. Two industry trade associations and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers argued that regulation of products used solely to facilitate P2P transfers would be premature, and could limit future development of innovative products, to the detriment of consumers. An issuing bank, a program manager, and a commenter representing non-bank money transfer providers noted that products used to facilitate P2P transfers could be interpreted to include products or services offered by State-licensed money transmitters, which they said are already covered under existing regulations. They argued that to avoid duplicative and potentially inconsistent regulation, the Bureau should specifically exclude any product or service that is subject to State or Federal money transmitter laws.",

To accomplish this change, the Bureau has removed the phrase \u201cis redeemable upon presentation at\u201d and replaced it with \u201cwhose primary function is,\u201d to clarify that, in order to qualify as a prepaid account under this portion of the definition, an account must be more than merely capable of being used in the ways specified. Finally, as part of its overall reordering of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3), the Bureau has renumbered proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) as final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2). Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2) defines a prepaid account, in part, as an account whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "The Bureau has considered the comments regarding the appropriateness of extending the definition of prepaid account to products that can only be used for P2P transfers, and has decided to finalize its decision to include such products in the definition of prepaid account. The Bureau continues to believe that the structure and usage of P2P products warrants their inclusion in the final rule. Unlike many limited-use prepaid products that have acceptance limited to a restricted location (such as at merchants located on a college campus or in a mall), P2P products do not have such a limitation. Indeed, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, insofar as a P2P product could be accepted by anyone that contracts with the P2P provider, the model is not very different from a card association that contracts with unaffiliated merchants. Further, insofar as consumers could use these products to pay anyone with funds stored in the account, the Bureau continues to believe that they should be included in the definition of prepaid account. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to exclude such products from coverage under the final rule. The Bureau is therefore finalizing the reference to P2P transfers in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2), and finalizing proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8, renumbered as comment 2(b)(3)(i)-10, largely as proposed.",

Specifically, the Bureau has refocused the definition to apply only to accounts \u201cwhose primary function is to conduct\u201d transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants or at ATMs, or P2P transfers. (In addition, as discussed below, the Bureau is adding a new prong, \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(3), to explicitly exclude checking accounts, share draft accounts, and NOW accounts from the residual definition of prepaid accounts.) The Bureau is aware that many types of accounts, including accounts already covered by Regulation E, may be capable of being used for the above functions. The Bureau is therefore concerned that the language used in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) could be over-inclusive, contributing to the uncertainty raised by some commenters regarding which accounts are covered under which provisions of Regulation E.",
                        "The Bureau intends its change here to narrow the definition of prepaid account to focus on products whose primary function for consumers is to provide general capability to use loaded funds to conduct transactions with merchants, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, while excluding products that only provide such capability incidental to a different primary function. For example, the primary function of a traditional brokerage account is to hold funds so that the consumer can conduct transactions through a licensed broker or firm, not to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers. Similarly, the primary function of a savings account is to accrue interest on funds held in the account; such accounts restrict the extent to which the consumer can conduct general transactions and withdrawals.",
                        "To provide greater clarity about this intended interpretation, the Bureau is making minor wording revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2) and related commentary to accommodate the \u201cprimary function\u201d approach, and is adding a comment with several illustrative examples of when an account satisfies the \u201cprimary function\u201d prong of final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8 clarifies that, to qualify as a prepaid account, an account's primary function must be to provide consumers with general transaction capabilities, including by enabling consumers to use loaded funds to conduct the transactions enumerated in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2), and that accounts that provide such capabilities only incidentally are excluded from the definition, and as such are not prepaid accounts as defined by final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3). The comment provides examples of accounts that provide the enumerated transactional capabilities only incidentally\u2014specifically, brokerage accounts and savings accounts, where a consumer deposits money, for example, with a financial institution for the primary purpose of conducting transactions with the institution (e.g., to conduct trades in a brokerage account) rather than with third parties. The comment then provides several examples for additional guidance. New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.i clarifies that an account's primary function is to enable a consumer to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, even if it also enables a third party to disburse funds to a consumer. For example, a prepaid account that conveys tax refunds or insurance proceeds to a consumer meets the primary function test if the account can be used, e.g., to purchase goods or services at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.",
                        "Next, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.ii clarifies that whether an account satisfies final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) is determined by reference to the account, not the access device associated with the account. An account satisfies final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if the account's access device can be used for other purposes, e.g., as a form of identification. Such accounts may include, for example, a prepaid account used to disburse student loan proceeds via a card device that can be used at unaffiliated merchants or to withdraw cash from an ATM, even if that access device also acts as a student identification card.",
                        "New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iii clarifies that, where multiple accounts are associated with the same access device, the primary function of each account is determined separately. The comment goes on to clarify that one or more accounts can satisfy final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if other accounts associated with the same access device do not. This commentary is intended to address situations where two or more separate \u201cwallets\u201d or \u201cpurses\u201d are associated with the same access device. It provides the specific example of a student identification card, which may act as an access device associated with two separate accounts: An account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, and an account used to conduct closed-loop transactions on campus. The comment clarifies that the account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services satisfies final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), even though the account used to conduct closed-loop transactions does not.",
                        "Next, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iv clarifies that an account satisfies final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) if its primary function is to provide general transaction capability, even if an individual consumer does not in fact use it to conduct multiple transactions. For example, the fact that a consumer may choose to withdraw the entire account balance at an ATM or transfer it to another account held by the consumer does not change the fact that the account's primary function is to provide general transaction capability. The Bureau is including this comment to clarify that an account's primary function is not determined by how frequently an individual consumer chooses to use the account for a given function. This clarification aligns with the Bureau's decision, discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) above, to cover under the final rule as prepaid accounts those products that do not necessarily act as transaction account substitutes. For example, the Bureau understands that some consumers who receive funds from third parties\u2014such as tax refunds or insurance proceeds\u2014via prepaid accounts may not always transact with the accounts on an ongoing basis, opting instead to withdraw the funds from the account in their entirety after acquisition or transfer them to another account. Pursuant to new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iv, these consumer's accounts would still meet the \u201cprimary function\u201d prong set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2).",
                        "Finally, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.v states the corollary of the general rule set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2). Specifically, it explains that an account whose primary function is other than to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, does not satisfy final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). The comment goes on to provide the example of an account whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account as an account that would not qualify as a prepaid account under this prong of the definition. Such accounts could include, for example, so-called reload packs, which several industry commenters urged the Bureau to exclude from coverage under the final rule. In contrast to non-reloadable prepaid cards, which can be used to make purchases or other transactions, reload packs can only be used to transfer funds into prepaid accounts.",
                        "The Bureau is also adopting proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-7, renumbered as comment 2(b)(3)(i)-9, which cross-references comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2 for guidance on the meaning of the term redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants."

                        "The Bureau received several comments from industry, consumer groups, and one State government agency addressing this aspect of the proposal. Specifically, the consumer groups and the State government agency generally supported requiring financial institutions to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in the foreign language the financial institution uses in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account. Some of these commenters argued that, if financial institutions market prepaid accounts in a foreign language, or otherwise reach out to non- and limited-English speaking consumers, they should also be required to provide the disclosures in that language. One commenter urged the Bureau to require financial institutions to provide disclosures in commonly spoken languages. Another commenter explained that providing disclosures in a consumer's preferred language gives non- and limited-English speaking families accurate information regarding their prepaid accounts and creates an inclusive culture that consumers seek when making financial decisions. Another commenter requested that the Bureau extend this requirement to all required disclosures, not just the pre-acquisition disclosures.",
                        "Some of the consumer groups urged the Bureau to further expand the proposed foreign language requirements to require foreign language support for live customer service calls in any language the financial institution uses in connection with the marketing or acquisition of a prepaid account. Some commenters stated that customer service representatives (and interpreters) should be both fluent in the spoken language and knowledgeable about prepaid accounts to ensure that communication with non- and limited-English speaking consumers is as effective as communication with other consumers. One commenter explained that deploying a customer service representative (or an interpreter) that does not have the necessary expertise can result in the dissemination of inaccurate information. Other commenters stated that customer service calls in foreign languages also enable non- and limited-English speaking consumers to obtain account balances, request transaction information, access general account information, and exercise dispute rights. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) for a discussion of the comments received on foreign language support for customer service calls as it relates to accessing account information.",
                        "Two industry trade associations and a coalition of prepaid account issuers agreed that, where a financial institution engages in a deliberate marketing program to solicit consumers in a foreign language, it may be reasonable to require disclosures in that same language. One of the commenters explained that, in those situations, financial institutions control the languages used in the marketing programs and can determine whether it makes business sense to develop and implement disclosures in a particular language.",
                        "The Bureau received several comments from industry, including from industry trade associations, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, arguing, however, that the foreign language disclosure requirement, as proposed, would discourage financial institutions from servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers in their preferred languages, especially at branch locations and call centers. Several commenters argued that the \u201cby telephone\u201d and \u201cin person\u201d components of the proposed requirement could actually be detrimental to consumers because employees of a financial institution would be prohibited from engaging with them in their preferred languages if the financial institution did not have pre-acquisition disclosures available in those languages. These commenters stated that the proposed requirement would also undermine financial institutions' efforts to service communities with a high number of non- and limited-English speaking consumers (by hiring staff with specific language abilities and establishing branches and offices in those areas), which they stated is generally supported by other bank regulators. Several commenters urged the Bureau to apply instead the current foreign language disclosure requirements under Regulation E to prepaid accounts.\n          However, these commenters requested that, if the Bureau proceeds with the proposed requirement, the term \u201cprincipally uses a foreign language\u201d not cover certain situations, such as responses to consumer-initiated inquiries; interactions with consumers through the use of an interpreter; and interactions where the financial institution knows, based on a prior relationship or interaction, that the consumer prefers a language other than English.",
                        "These industry commenters argued that the requirement as proposed would also impose significant compliance burdens on financial institutions. These commenters explained that financial institutions would need to train their employees to speak only in English, or in the specific languages for which pre-acquisition disclosures are available, if the topic of prepaid accounts comes up while assisting consumers. These commenters stated that customer service interactions that are in person or over the telephone could implicate hundreds of languages, thereby making compliance with the proposed requirements virtually impossible. These commenters further stated that financial institutions cannot always control the languages spoken at a retail setting, by a program manager, or even at branch locations. In addition, these commenters stated that financial institutions cannot ensure that third-party providers, such as employers and government agencies, will comply with the requirement because financial institutions might not know whether a language other than English is spoken at the time of acquisition.",
                        "One industry commenter urged the Bureau not to require financial institutions to provide the long form disclosure in English upon request in addition to providing the disclosures in a foreign language, as it did not believe it would be necessary or customary to do so."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9), pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, with several modifications explained below. The Bureau believes that certain foreign language disclosures are necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users, because the proposed revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts. In addition, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the foreign language disclosures will ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.",
                        "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) sets forth the general foreign language disclosure requirements for prepaid accounts. Specifically, it requires a financial institution to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) in a foreign language, if the financial institution uses that same foreign language in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account in the following circumstances: (1) The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material; (2) the financial institution principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account and provides a means in the advertisement, solicitation, or marketing material that the consumer uses to acquire the prepaid account by telephone or electronically; or (3) the financial institution provides a means for the consumer to acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically principally in a foreign language.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) the general requirement from the proposal that a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language, if the financial institution principally uses that foreign language on prepaid account packaging material, by telephone, or on the Web site a consumer uses to acquire a prepaid account. The Bureau is clarifying in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) that the requirement to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language applies only in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account. In addition, the Bureau has replaced the phrase \u201con the Web site\u201d with \u201celectronically\u201d in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) to more clearly cover all situations in which a consumer can electronically acquire a prepaid account, such as by clicking on a link provided by the financial institution on an advertisement accessed on a mobile device, for example. The Bureau continues to believe that if a financial institution provides a way for a consumer to acquire a prepaid account in a foreign language, the financial institution is making a deliberate effort to obtain the consumer's business and therefore should be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language. The Bureau also believes that if a financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the interface that a consumer sees or uses to initiate the process of acquiring a prepaid account, the consumer should receive pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language to ensure they are able to understand the required disclosures.",
                        "However, the Bureau has removed from final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) the proposed requirement to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if the financial institution principally uses that foreign language in person, as requested by several commenters. The Bureau agrees with commenters that servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers in their preferred language is critical and would not want to discourage employees of financial institutions at branch locations from using their foreign language abilities to assist these consumers. Similarly, the Bureau understands the importance of servicing communities with a high number of non- and limited-English speaking consumers and does not seek to stifle efforts made by financial institutions to reach out to these communities.\n          In addition, the Bureau understands that financial institutions cannot always know or control the languages that are spoken at branch locations or in other in-person environments (particularly when those locations are operated by third parties), and that providing disclosures in every possible language their employees speak might not be feasible. The Bureau believes that by not including the in-person trigger in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i), financial institutions will be able to better comply with this requirement while not discouraging them from servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers.",
                        "The Bureau has added a trigger for when a financial institution principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account and provides a means in the advertisement, solicitation, or marketing material for the consumer to acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically, in response to the comments it received. The Bureau agrees with commenters that if a financial institution deliberately targets consumers by advertising, soliciting, or marketing to them in a foreign language, the financial institution should be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that same language. The Bureau believes it is particularly important to require financial institutions to provide the disclosures in a foreign language, if in addition to deliberately targeting consumers, financial institutions use those same communications to drive consumers to a specific telephone number or Web site to acquire a prepaid account.",
                        "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(ii) provides that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language. The Bureau believes that the ability to obtain the long form disclosure information in English will be beneficial to consumers in various situations, such as when a family member is assisting a non-English speaking consumer to manage his prepaid account but only reads English. Further, this requirement is consistent with existing \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(2), which requires that disclosures made under Regulation E in a language other than English be made available in English upon the customer's request. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions that offer prepaid accounts in a foreign language already provide the pre-acquisition disclosures and the initial disclosures in both English and the foreign language without a request from the consumer, which the Bureau believes is beneficial for consumers. The Bureau has also revised the internal paragraph references within final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9) and related commentary to conform to numbering changes in this final rule and has made other technical revisions for organizational purposes.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(6)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(9)-1, with examples that reflect the changes to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) and that illustrate situations in which a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language and situations in which it is not required to provide the disclosures.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-2 to clarify when a foreign language is principally used. This comment explains that all relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the financial institution to advertise, solicit, or market under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9). Whether a foreign language is principally used is determined at the packaging material, advertisement, solicitation, or marketing communication level, not at the prepaid account program level or across the financial institution's activities as a whole. A financial institution that advertises a prepaid account program in multiple languages would evaluate its use of foreign language in each advertisement to determine whether it has principally used a foreign language therein.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-3 to explain the term \u201cadvertise, solicit, or market.\u201d This comment clarifies that any commercial message, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of prepaid accounts constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9). This comment also provides examples illustrating advertising, soliciting, and marketing. The Bureau notes that advertising, soliciting, and marketing could include, for example, outreach via social media. New comment 18(b)(9)-3 resembles comment 31(g)(1)-2, which corresponds to the foreign language disclosure requirements for remittance transfers in \u00a7\u20091005.31(g)(1). However, new comment 18(b)(9)-3 has been altered to accommodate for the differences between how consumers acquire prepaid accounts and how they initiate remittance transfers. For example, the Bureau did not include in new comment 18(b)(9)-3 specific examples from comment 31(g)(1)-2 related to advertisements, solicitations, and marketing communications at an office because scenarios at an office do not usually apply in the prepaid account context.\n          In addition, the Bureau believes that leaving these examples out of new comment 18(b)(9)-3 avoids confusion related to the proposed in person trigger that was removed from this final rule. Thus, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9) would not apply to general advertisements, solicitations, and marketing communications that are in a foreign language and displayed at a retail or branch location that do not meet any of the triggers in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i)(A) through (C).",
                        "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-4 to explain the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(ii), which states that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language. New comment 18(b)(9)-4 clarifies that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9)(i) may, but is not required to, provide the English version of the pre-acquisition long form disclosure information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) for the long form disclosure.",
                        "The Bureau declines to implement at this time other suggestions made by several commenters, which include requiring foreign language support for customer service calls; requiring customer service representatives and interpreters to be both fluent in a foreign language and knowledgeable about prepaid accounts; and requiring all disclosures, not just pre-acquisition disclosures, to be provided in a foreign language. The Bureau believes these measures are beyond the scope of this rulemaking and therefore declines to adopt them now. The Bureau is also concerned that imposing additional requirements in this final rule would discourage financial institutions from servicing non- or limited-English speaking consumers and from offering prepaid accounts in foreign languages. The Bureau understands that the costs associated with such requirements involve hiring and retaining trained personnel fluent in other languages, which may be cost prohibitive for many financial institutions. In addition, the Bureau has focused on the pre-acquisition disclosures because it believes that they present a reasonable and appropriate step forward focusing on the most important information at the stage that the consumer is acquiring the prepaid account. But for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau declines to insert additional requirements in this final rule."

New comment 18(b)(8)-1 provides an example illustrating this requirement. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may substitute the term prepaid \u201caccount\u201d for the term prepaid \u201ccard\u201d as appropriate, wherever it is used in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b).",
                "A consumer group commenter recommended that the Bureau require uniform terms across disclosures to prevent use of a variety of terminology for certain required fees and information. The Bureau agrees that use of consistent terminology within and across the short form and long form disclosures for a particular prepaid account program will enhance consumer comprehension, and thus is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(8). The Bureau declines to eliminate the \u201csubstantially similar\u201d requirement for various terms throughout final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2) and replace it with a less flexible standard. Thus, the final rule generally does not require the uniform use of a specific term for particular fees across all short form disclosures. The Bureau believes it can achieve a degree of standardization across short form disclosures that will enhance consumer engagement and comprehension by requiring that the terms used be substantially similar to the terms set forth in the rule and model forms without mandating universal use of a specific term. Moreover, the Bureau believes the safe harbor afforded to financial institutions using the short form disclosure model forms will encourage financial institutions to use the specific terminology in the model forms where appropriate.",
                "However, as set forth in the comment 18(b)(8)-1, a financial institution may use the terms prepaid \u201caccount\u201d and prepaid \u201ccard\u201d interchangeably in the short and long forms, as appropriate. The Bureau is allowing use of these terms because they may be used synonymously in the prepaid context, particularly in light of the terminology used in this final rule, but the Bureau recognizes that in some cases one of the terms may be more apt than the other."

Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(9) further provided that if neither of these two types of credit plans would be offered in connection with the prepaid account at any point, a financial institution would have to disclose on the short form a statement that no overdraft or credit-related fees will be charged, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in proposed Model Form A-10(d).

                        "As discussed in the proposal, in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, many participants expressed a desire to avoid using any financial products that offer overdraft. Further, other research indicates that many consumers turn to prepaid cards specifically to avoid incurring any overdraft charges.\n          The Bureau therefore believed that if a financial institution may offer a credit feature, then a consumer should be on notice of this possibility before acquiring the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that placing such notice on the short form disclosure would allow consumers to decide whether they want to acquire a prepaid account that may offer credit, or whether they would prefer an account that would not offer credit. Without such a notice, the Bureau believed that consumers may not have adequate information to decide which prepaid account is best for them. The Bureau recognized that there might be some risk of confusion from providing a relatively terse statement about credit because the Bureau also proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) and in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h) to require financial institutions to wait at least 30 days before offering prepaid account holders credit, and not all account holders may qualify for such credit features in any event.

                        "While the Bureau received many comments regarding its proposed approach to regulating overdraft and certain other credit features on prepaid accounts generally, few commenters addressed the Bureau's proposal regarding how to disclose these features in the short form and long form disclosures.\n          With regard to the short form disclosure, two issuing banks and an industry trade association recommended eliminating the disclosure for products that could offer associated credit features, saying it would be confusing to consumers given that the proposed rules would require financial institutions to wait 30 days after registration of a prepaid account to offer credit features and to obtain separate consumer consent. Another industry trade association and a program manager recommended substituting the word \u201cfeature\u201d for \u201cfee\u201d in the proposed disclosure of \u201cNo overdraft or credit-related fees,\u201d suggesting this change would avoid the potentially erroneous impression that a credit feature might be offered for free.",
                        "Two consumer groups recommended including the disclosure in the short form only when overdraft or credit are offered and not when such features are not offered. They said that disclosure when such features are not offered would confuse consumers, as most prepaid account programs do not offer overdraft or credit. They also said the absence of the negative disclosure would offer a starker contrast to the affirmative disclosure required when such features are offered. These consumer groups also recommended more fulsome disclosure in the short form regarding offered overdraft and credit features, such as requiring disclosure of fees for transfers, loads, negative balances, and insufficient funds. These groups also recommended that this disclosure should be made more prominent, such as by requiring a larger-size font. One consumer group recommended that the disclosure distinguish between prepaid account programs that offer overdraft and those that offer credit features so that financial institutions that offer prepaid accounts with low cost lines of credit (with consumer consent) can be distinguished from those that offer overdraft. Finally, two consumer groups recommended that the Bureau require the word \u201coverdraft\u201d in the disclosure because, they said, consumers know this term and it is crucial information for them. These consumer groups also opposed using the term \u201ccredit-related fees,\u201d as they believed it would be opaque and incomprehensible to consumers."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(9) and comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(9)-1, renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) and comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1, as proposed with certain modifications as described below. As discussed below in connection with Regulation Z, the final rule makes some revisions as to the proposal's scope of coverage regarding covered overdraft and other credit features and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) mirrors these revisions. The final rule also revises the proposed content of the disclosure for clarity and completeness. The Bureau also made technical modifications to the rule and final comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1 for conformity and clarity.",
                        "Specifically, if a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 may be offered at any point to a consumer in connection with the prepaid account, the final rule requires the financial institution to disclose a statement that overdraft/credit may be offered, the time period after which it may be offered, and that fees would apply, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cYou may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.\u201d If no such credit feature will be offered at any point to a consumer in connection with the prepaid account, the financial institution must disclose a statement that no overdraft/credit feature is offered, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cNo overdraft/credit feature.\u201d Comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1, adopted largely as proposed, clarifies that this statement must be provided on the short form disclosures for all prepaid accounts that may offer such a feature, regardless of whether some consumers may never be solicited or qualify to enroll in such a feature.",
                        "As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting the requirement to disclose in the short form whether an overdraft credit feature as defined by the final rule may be offered in connection with a prepaid account because it believes this is key information consumers should know to better inform their prepaid account purchase and use decisions, particularly for those consumers seeking to use prepaid accounts to avoid overdraft or credit-related charges and those seeking out prepaid accounts with such features.\n          In keeping with the overall goal of the short form disclosure to provide consumers with a snapshot of key information, the disclosure required in the final rule is designed to alert consumers to whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered to them and, if so, two other key pieces of information\u2014that there is a waiting period, and that fees will apply.",
                        "The Bureau does not believe it is possible to give consumers the detailed information needed to make a decision about an overdraft credit feature on the short form, and that attempting to do so would substantially undermine the value of the form\u2014that is, succinctly providing consumers with the most important information needed to make a decision about whether to acquire the prepaid account. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that devoting scarce space to overdraft credit features would distract consumers from this decision-making process, resulting in less space to address the core functionalities of the prepaid account. In addition, given that some consumers may not satisfy creditors' underwriting requirements or other eligibility criteria, the Bureau believes that a limited disclosure strikes the best practicable balance between competing considerations.",
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to limit information on the short form disclosure about overdraft credit features to this one statement, and to refer consumers to the long form for more detailed information about all fees and conditions, including information about any overdraft credit feature. The Bureau recognizes that the short form disclosure will not provide consumers with a detailed definition of the term \u201coverdraft/credit\u201d or the details about a particular overdraft credit feature, but believes that the disclosure strikes a reasonable balance given the goals of the form, its performance in testing, and its space constraints. In short, the Bureau believes that the form will give consumers the most critical information about any overdraft credit features with a strong incentive to seek additional details in the long form disclosure or elsewhere if they are interested. Relatedly, consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature from the additional fee type disclosures required in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), as discussed above.",
                        "Participants in the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing generally understood that an affirmative statement about the availability of overdraft or credit in a prototype short form disclosure indicated the feature was offered while a negative statement indicated it was not offered. All participants given a short form indicating a prepaid card did not offer overdraft or credit correctly understood that no such program would be offered or that a transaction would not go through if the consumer tried to make a purchase for more money than the amount loaded on the card. Conversely, all participants given a short form indicating a prepaid card offered overdraft or credit who noticed the statement correctly understood that a transaction might be allowed in some cases if they tried to make a purchase for more money than the amount loaded on the card.\n          Thus, post-proposal testing results confirm consumer understanding of disclosures both when an overdraft credit feature is offered and when no such feature is offered\u2014as would have been required by the proposed rule.",
                        "Moreover, the long form disclosure will provide additional information about overdraft credit features for consumers who are interested in such programs including, as referenced by a consumer group commenter, programs under which prepaid accounts with low lines of credit are offered. As discussed in detail below, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iv) requires that the long form disclosure contain a statement that mirrors the overdraft credit statement required in the short form by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x). In addition, for prepaid account programs offering an overdraft credit feature as defined by the final rule, the long form disclosure must include the actual fees consumers may incur for using that feature that are imposed in connection with the prepaid account (pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii)),\n          as well as the disclosures described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.60(e)(1) (pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii)).",
                        "The Bureau also believes that the final rule's refinements to the language and placement of the short form statement about overdraft credit features will reduce the risk of consumer confusion about the nature and timing of any credit offers. To emphasize its importance, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B)(1), the statement about overdraft credit features must be in bold-faced type. The proposed rule would have required the statement to be located within the fee section of the short form disclosure, just below the top-line fees, to emphasize its relative importance among all the disclosures on the short form. In the final rule, the Bureau has relocated the statement to the section below the fee disclosures together with other statements required in the short form disclosure, as upon further consideration, the Bureau is concerned locating it amidst the fee disclosures could be confusing to consumers.",
                        "The Bureau's consumer testing and other considerations, such as commenters' concerns that consumers may be confused by the proposed short form's lack of information regarding availability of the feature and the Bureau's proposed 30-day waiting period, after which consumers may be solicited for or may link credit to a prepaid account, led the Bureau to require disclosure that a consumer \u201c may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days\u201d (emphasis added). In response to the concern that the proposed disclosure could intimate that prepaid account programs offer overdraft or credit programs for free, the final rule requires explicit disclosure that \u201c[f]ees would apply.\u201d Where no overdraft credit feature will be offered, the final rule requires disclosure of \u201c[n]o overdraft/credit feature\u201d (emphasis added), replacing the proposed term \u201cfee.\u201d The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed, consistent with the Bureau's proposed rule, that the statements required in the final rule effectively provide the information that the Bureau intends to be imparted in that most participants understood that overdraft or credit may or may not be offered (as applicable), that obtaining the service is not guaranteed, that there is a 30-day waiting period, and that they may pay fees for the service.",
                        "The disclosures required under the final rule use the term \u201coverdraft/credit\u201d instead of the proposed \u201ccredit-related [fees]\u201d and \u201coverdraft or credit-related [fees]\u201d because the Bureau agrees with commenters that use of the term \u201coverdraft\u201d in both versions of the disclosure may be more meaningful to consumers. The Bureau is concerned that, while the term \u201coverdraft credit\u201d (without a slash) is more technically accurate, it may not have particular meaning to consumers. The Bureau also believes that use of the same term in both the short form and long form disclosures will facilitate consumers' ability to comparison shop.",
                        "For all of these reasons, the Bureau believes that the refined and relatively short statement regarding whether overdraft credit features may be offered in connection with the prepaid account strikes the best balance for the short form disclosure. The Bureau therefore declines to add additional details about the terms of such overdraft credit features to the short form disclosure."

The Bureau examined this issue in its post-proposal consumer testing and found that participants did not construe the language negatively, confirming the Bureau's original understanding from the proposal.\n        Participants were provided a prototype short form disclosure with the statement language from the proposed rule (version one) or a disclosure with the following language (version two):\u2009\n        \u201cYou have several options to receive your wages [benefits]: direct deposit to your bank account; direct deposit to your own prepaid card, or using this payroll [benefits] card. Tell your employer [the government agency/office] which option you want.\u201d",
                "All testing participants understood both versions of the statement language as saying that they did not have to accept their wages/government benefits via that prepaid card. Also, while participants understood from both versions that there were other ways to receive their payments, those that received version two were able to identify the specific options available to them. Finally, most participants expressed essentially neutral feelings about both versions of the statement and appeared to be drawing on past experiences, rather than the language in the statement, to decide whether or not they would want to use the payroll card account or the government benefit account.",
                "Even though the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that the proposed version of the statement regarding wage or benefit payment options would not be perceived as negative by consumers and that participants understood the statement, the Bureau has decided to include in the final rule an alternative version of the statement language which the Bureau believes would address commenters' concerns and have the added advantage of providing concrete options to consumer of how they can receive their funds.",
                "The Bureau is thus finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), which provides that for payroll card accounts, a financial institution must disclose a statement that the consumer does not have to accept the payroll card account and directing the consumer to ask about other ways to receive wages or salary from the employer instead of receiving them via the payroll card account using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cYou do not have to accept this payroll card. Ask your employer about other ways to receive your wages.\u201d Alternatively, a financial institution may provide a statement that the consumer has several options to receive wages or salary, followed by a list of the options available to the consumer, and directing the consumer to tell the employer which option the consumer chooses using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cYou have several options to receive your wages: [list of options available to the consumer]; or this payroll card. Tell your employer which option you choose.\u201d This statement must be located above the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv), which are located in the top line of the short form.",
                "The statements regarding wage payment options in the final rule do not incorporate much of the additional information recommended by some consumer group commenters, such as explaining the benefit of direct deposit and providing information on how to un-enroll from the payroll card account. The Bureau declines to add such information because the design of the short form disclosure seeks a balance between the disclosure of key information necessary for consumer acquisition and use decisions and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and engagement. While space constraints are less severe in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts than in retail locations, the Bureau is still concerned that adding this information would affect this balance and risk information overload. In response to recommendations to make the statement more conspicuous, the Bureau believes that its relative length and position at the top of the short form disclosure already provide heightened conspicuousness.",
                "New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 makes clear that financial institutions offering payroll card accounts may choose which of the two statements required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) to use in the short form disclosure. The list of options required in the second statement might include the following, as applicable: Direct deposit to the consumer's bank account, direct deposit to the consumer's own prepaid account, paper check, or cash. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, provide more specificity as to whom consumers must ask or inform of their choice of wage payment method, such as specifying the employer's Human Resources Department. The Bureau notes that, based on comments received, direct deposit to the consumer's own prepaid account is often not recognized as an option to receiving wages via the payroll card account for consumers. The Bureau believes that this is an important option of which consumers should be apprised, and has thus included it in comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 in the list of enumerated wage payment options when using the second version of the required statement.",
                "New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-2 cross-references \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i) for statement options for government benefit accounts. In response to commenter recommendation that the Bureau extend the notice requirement to other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau declines to require such a statement for other types of prepaid accounts as it does not believe that to be necessary at this time. However, new comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-3 clarifies that a financial institution offering a prepaid account other than a payroll card account or a government benefit account may, but is not required to, include a statement in the short form disclosure regarding payment options that is similar to either of the statements required for payroll card accounts pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) or government benefit accounts pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i). For example, a financial institution issuing a prepaid account to disburse student financial aid proceeds may disclose a statement such as the following: \u201cYou have several options to receive your financial aid payments: direct deposit to your bank account, direct deposit to your own prepaid card, paper check, or this prepaid card. Tell your school which option you choose.\u201d The Bureau believes consumers would benefit from knowing their options and thus is clarifying that this disclosure may be provided by financial institutions for other types of prepaid accounts, but declines to require such a statement for other types of prepaid accounts as requested by some consumer group commenters."

In the proposal, the Bureau indicated that it intended to develop resources on its Web site that would, among other things, provide basic information to consumers about prepaid accounts, the benefits and risks of using them, how to use the final rule's prepaid account disclosures, and a URL to the Bureau's Web site where they can submit a complaint about a prepaid account.",
                "The Bureau received comments from the office of a State Attorney General, an industry trade association, and a group advocating on behalf of business interests about this portion of the proposal. The office of the State Attorney General generally supported the disclosure while the trade association and business group recommended that the Bureau eliminate the disclosure. The industry trade association suggested that eliminating the disclosure would make room in the short form for information more valuable to consumers and reduce consumer confusion. It first asserted that the disclosure would not be necessary in bank branches because Bureau contact information was included in the proposed long form, which would be provided to consumers at the same time as the short form in a bank branch. Second, it said that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing suggested consumers are unlikely to access the Bureau's Web site when reviewing the short form disclosure. Third, the commenter expressed concern about consumer confusion, stating that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing suggested consumers would more likely access a financial institution's Web site for additional information about a prepaid account rather than obtaining more general information from the Bureau's Web site. Finally, it argued that listing both the financial institution's Web site and the Bureau's Web site on the short form disclosure would misdirect consumers, because in one of the rounds of the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, half of the participants stated that they would go to the Bureau's Web site to get additional information about a particular prepaid card product.",
                "The business group opposed including a link to the Bureau's Web site in both the short form and long form disclosures. It stated that the link to the Web site in the model short form disclosure was not yet an operating Web site, and therefore the commenter said it could not comment on the wisdom of directing consumers to this particular Bureau Web page. The commenter further suggested that requiring financial institutions to disclose the Bureau's Web site URL on the short form disclosure constituted Bureau interference with the purchasing process and would instill doubt in the consumer's mind about the safety of the prepaid account. It said it believed questions about prepaid accounts should be directed to the financial institution in the first instance, not to a regulatory agency.",
                "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(14), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xii), with minor modifications. The Bureau has moved the required language for this disclosure into the regulatory text, and has modified that language to specify that the disclosed Web site URL would provide consumers with general information about prepaid accounts. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity. Accordingly, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xii) requires that financial institutions include in the short form a statement directing the consumer to a Web site URL of the Bureau (cfpb.gov/prepaid) for general information about prepaid accounts, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cFor general information about prepaid accounts, visit cfpb.gov/prepaid.\u201d",
                "The Bureau is not persuaded by industry commenters' objections that this disclosure is unnecessary, inappropriate, or confusing. In the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the short form disclosure, most participants understood that the Web site in this disclosure was administered by a government agency, not the financial institution, and that it would contain general information about prepaid accounts.\n        The Bureau continues to believe that it is important to provide consumers with a non-commercial alternative source of information about prepaid accounts to enhance consumers' ability to learn about prepaid accounts in general in order to better inform their purchase and use decisions."

As discussed in more detail below, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(2) would have required that the electronic and written histories in the periodic statement alternative include the information set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.9(b). This provision currently exists for payroll card accounts in existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2), but does not presently appear in \u00a7\u20091005.15 for government benefit accounts.

To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers (including government benefit account consumers), the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require inclusion of all fees charged and summary totals of both monthly and annual fees. The Bureau believes that these revisions will assist consumers' understanding of the account activity on their government benefit accounts. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because it believes that disclosure of all fees and account activity summaries will ensure that the features of government benefit accounts, over the term of the account, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with government benefit accounts.",

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(i) below, the Bureau sought comment on whether a similar requirement to provide balance information at a terminal should be added to the requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c) for prepaid accounts generally, or whether, alternatively, the requirement should be eliminated from \u00a7\u20091005.15 given the other proposed enhancements and for parity with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18.",

In addition, an industry trade association and an issuing bank opposed the Bureau's decision to maintain the requirement that government agencies wishing to take advantage of the periodic statement alternative provide consumers' account balance information at a terminal, arguing that terminal access was outdated and has been replaced by text or online account access. Two consumer groups, by contrast, supported the continued requirement for balance information at a terminal for government benefit accounts and urged the Bureau to expand the requirement to all prepaid accounts.

To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers (including government benefit account consumers), the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to continue the exception to the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) for government benefit accounts and to modify that exception in Regulation E to more closely align it with the proposed requirements for prepaid accounts generally. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) below, the Bureau has modified proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) to require 12 months of electronic account transaction history and 24 months of written account transaction history instead of 18 months for both as proposed. The Bureau has therefore modified \u00a7\u20091005.15(d)(1) accordingly. The Bureau believes that this revision strikes the appropriate balance between the burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) discussed below, ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. Final comment 15(d)-1 cross-references final comments 18(c)-1 through -3 and -5 through -9 for further guidance on the access to account information requirements.",
                        "In response to the comment that the proposed 18-month access to account information requirements should not be extended to government benefit accounts, the Bureau is not convinced that there is a significant difference between the burden these requirements place on prepaid account issuers as financial institutions and the burden they place on government agencies, since, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, government benefit account programs are typically administered by financial institutions pursuant to a contract between the institution and the agency.\n          With respect to the requirement that government agencies continue to provide account balances at terminal locations, the Bureau has considered the comments and is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.15(d)(1)(i) as proposed. The requirement is unchanged from existing \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1); recipients of government benefits may have come to rely on the ATM as a source of account information, and the Bureau does not see a need to remove this provision from the final rule. Relatedly, the Bureau notes that ATMs are still in wide use by consumers of various financial services products, and as such, it disagrees with commenters who argued that ATMs are an obsolete method of providing balance information to consumers. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that recipients of government benefits may be among the neediest consumers of prepaid accounts, and as such, may be less likely to have access to a mobile phone when they need it, such as prior to withdrawing money at the ATM. Having access to their balance at an ATM could help consumers in this scenario avoid costly fees. Finally, the Bureau notes that government agencies and financial institutions remain free under the final rule to recommend or encourage consumers to use particular modes of accessing their account balances."

                "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cWe charge [x] other types of fees.\u201d The number of additional fee types disclosed must reflect the total number of fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees, excluding fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61.",
                "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) because it continues to believe, as explained in the proposal, that it is crucial to inform consumers that there may be a cost for features not otherwise captured in the short form disclosure. Disclosure of this information will help both alert consumers that the short form is not a comprehensive fee disclosure and encourage consumers to seek out more information about the prepaid account from the long form disclosure and other sources. As noted in the proposal, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing revealed that participants often did not know all the fees that might be assessed prior to their purchase of a prepaid account. In addition, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, while not all participants understood the significance of the disclosure of the number of additional fee types, participants were keenly interested in this disclosure, which the Bureau believes will motivate consumers to seek more information about these additional fee types.",
                "The Bureau declines to use a more general statement to alert consumers that there may be additional fees, as requested by some industry commenters. The Bureau believes that disclosure of the specific number of additional fee types, as opposed to a general statement regarding other fees charged, provides consumers with concrete information and stronger motivation to both better inform themselves and to direct their searches for additional information. Moreover, as discussed below, the Bureau believes that focusing the disclosure on tallying the types of fees rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total directly addresses industry's concerns that disclosing a specific number of other fees would prompt consumers to assign undue negative weight to the fact that a product may have many fee variations. The change to fee types also helps reduce compliance burden across the two related disclosures of the number of additional fee types required by this provision and the disclosure of additional fee types required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix).",
                "The Bureau disagrees with commenters that the comprehensive disclosure of all fees in another disclosure, such as the long form or the cardholder agreement, negates the rationale for disclosing the number of additional fee types in the short form. The Bureau believes that consumers generally would rely solely on the short form disclosure in making their acquisition decisions if they do not see language that specifically emphasizes the value of consulting the long form. The Bureau thus believes that listing the total number of fee types that are not otherwise listed on the short form will complement and enhance the statement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) directing consumers to the long form, providing a concrete incentive to consult the longer disclosure for products that are more complex.\n        Specifically, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, when asked how they could learn more about \u201cother fees\u201d not shown on the short form, practically all participants referred to the financial institution's telephone number and Web site disclosed on the prototype short form disclosure (i.e., the information sources required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii)).\n        In sum, the Bureau believes that the disclosure of the number of additional fee types in the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) will directly inform consumers of important information and serve to spur them to further inquiry in other more detailed disclosures.",
                "The Bureau acknowledges commenters' concerns that some consumers may tend to assume that a prepaid account with a relatively high number of additional fees is more expensive or less desirable than other accounts, even when the opposite may be true. In part to address this concern, the Bureau is finalizing the rule requiring financial institutions to disclose the total number of fee types, rather than the total number of all fees (including all fee variations within a fee type) that would have been required under the proposal. Requiring disclosure of the number of fee types instead of the number of discrete fees likely will reduce the number required to be disclosed for a typical prepaid account program. The Bureau believes that this modification for the final rule should help ameliorate the risk raised by some commenters that consumers will reject prepaid accounts with a high number of additional fees out of hand without seeking more detailed fee information to determine whether the products meet their needs. Moreover, the requirements for both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) are based on fee types (as opposed to one being based on discrete fees and the other on fee types), thereby reducing the burden of developing and maintaining two separate counts to determine and disclose the elements under their respective rules. The Bureau is also providing a list of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2, discussed below\u2014which are based on fees that the Bureau is aware exist in the current prepaid marketplace\u2014that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau believes that these provisions will reduce the risks and burdens raised by commenters concerning the proposed disclosure of the total number of fees not otherwise listed, while still providing the consumer with an important signal and incentive to investigate prepaid accounts that have more complex pricing structures.",
                "In addition, the Bureau believes that this modification addresses commenters' concerns, at least in part, regarding a potential chill to innovation of new features because such fee variations within a fee type will not be required to be separately counted for purposes of this disclosure. The Bureau intends to monitor compliance with this rule, including financial institutions' disclosures of the number of additional fee types charged, as well as market innovations in the prepaid industry more generally, and will consider additional action in future rulemakings if necessary.",
                "Modifying the final rule to require disclosure of the number of fee types also addresses concerns raised by some commenters that the proposed disclosure would have included many fees that are not commonly incurred by consumers\u2014including fees for discretionary features that require specific consumer action before they are incurred. For example, under the final rule, a financial institution would count bill payment as an additional fee type if it offered this feature, but, unlike the rule as proposed, would not count each of the discrete fee variations within bill payment such as ACH bill payment, paper check bill payment, check cancellation, and regular or expedited delivery of a paper check. Thus, in addition to a reduction in the overall number of additional fees required to be disclosed under the final rule, a financial institution would similarly not be required to disclose many of the less common fees and fees triggered by affirmative consumer action. While some of the additional fee types required to be disclosed in the final rule may still be less common or triggered only when a consumer elects to use an optional service, the Bureau reiterates that the primary objective of this provision is to alert consumers to fee information absent from the short form and to spur consumers to take action to gain a more fulsome understanding of the terms of a prospective prepaid account; this disclosure fulfils this objective.",
                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) below, the Bureau is adopting a de minimis threshold with respect to the disclosure of specific additional fee types. The Bureau does not believe a de minimis threshold would be appropriate for the disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) regarding the total number of additional fee types. The Bureau notes, however, that with the de minimis threshold in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), disclosure of such fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) would not be required, although such fee types would be counted in the total number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii).",
                "Finally, the Bureau continues to believe it is not necessary to include in the final rule specific requirements for updating the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, particularly those sold at retail. If a financial institution is making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program, Regulation E provides a means for financial institutions to notify consumers of terms associated with a new EFT service that is added to a consumer's account, in \u00a7\u20091005.7(c). A financial institution may provide new consumer disclosures in accordance with \u00a7\u20091005.7(c) post-acquisition, without needing to pull and replace card packaging that does not reflect that new optional feature in the disclosure of the number of additional fee types pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). The Bureau does expect, however, that financial institutions will keep their other disclosures up to date (including those provided electronically and orally, as well as disclosures provided in writing that are not a part of pre-printed packaging materials, such as those printed by a financial institution upon a consumer's request). The Bureau intends to monitor financial institutions' practices in this area, however, and may consider additional requirements in a future rulemaking if necessary.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1 clarifies what fee types to count in the total number of additional fee types, specifically excluding fees otherwise required to be disclosed in and outside the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final \u00a7\u20091026.61. Excluding the static fees and fees required to be disclosed outside the short form avoids the duplicative counting of fees already disclosed to the consumer. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself rather than any charges related to overdraft credit features. The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: \u201cYou may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.\u201d Consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from the disclosures regarding additional fees under both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, for more details.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.i explains that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. The comment additionally clarifies that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.ii explains that fee types that bear a relationship to, but are separate from, the static fees disclosed in the short form must be counted as additional fee types for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii). The comment also provides a detailed explanation regarding the treatment of international ATM fees and fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload). In addition, the comment explains that additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types. This is because the exclusions in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) and (2) are only for fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Further, the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) explains that the additional fee types disclosed are some of the total number of additional fee types.",
                "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance regarding the calculation of the number of additional fee types pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) as well as to address concerns raised by an industry commenter regarding how to categorize fees in determining the additional fee types to disclose under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment explains that the term fee type, as used in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), is a general category under which a financial institution charges fees to consumers. A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. (The Bureau notes that an additional fee type for which a financial institution does not charge any fee to the consumer, including for any variations of the additional fee type, is not counted in the total number of additional fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) nor required to be disclosed on the short form under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix).) The comment goes on to provide a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment also explains that a financial institution may create an appropriate name for other additional fee types.",
                "The Bureau compiled the list of examples of fee types in new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance to financial institutions and to help facilitate their categorization of additional fee types for satisfying the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (ix). The list also may encourage standardization of this portion of the short form in that, although additional fee types disclosed will vary across short forms for different prepaid account programs, the Bureau believes financial institutions will generally use consistent nomenclature for additional fee types identified on the list. The Bureau compiled this list of examples of fee types based on particular fee types referenced in comments received on the proposal and by reviewing the packaging of and disclosures for scores of prepaid account programs.\n        The Bureau balanced multiple considerations in compiling the list in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for purposes of both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), including existing industry practices with regard to fee types, the accounting burdens associated with relatively narrower or broader definitions of fee types, and the potential benefits to both industry and consumers in using narrower definitions of fee types to communicate information about specific account features and fees. The Bureau believes the resulting list strikes an appropriate balance by capturing categories and terms employed by the prepaid industry itself that will be useful to financial institutions and consumers in determining and understanding additional fee types. The Bureau is providing flexibility to financial institutions to fashion appropriate names for other fee types, including fee types for services that do not yet exist in the prepaid marketplace.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-3 clarifies that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi), a financial institution using the multiple service plan short form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) must disclose only the fee for calling customer service via a live agent. Thus, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii), any charge for calling customer service via an interactive voice response system must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-4 clarifies that a financial institution must use the same categorization of fee types in the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and in its determination of which additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau is including this comment on consistency to make clear that a financial institution is not permitted to, for example, shorten its list of fee types into a few broad categories (in order to minimize the number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)) but use a more detailed list of fee types broken out into a greater number of categories when assessing its obligations under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) (in order to maximize the number of fee types that may fall below the de minimis threshold pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2))."

The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing of such explanations support this conclusion.\n        Pre-proposal testing of a statement intended to inform consumers that the fees listed were those that generated significant revenue for the financial institution resulted in minimal participant comprehension or notice.\n        Post-proposal testing of a similar disclosure that, in addition to including an explanation of the criteria for disclosing such fees (i.e., that the two fees listed were the most commonly charged), also directed consumers where to find detail about all fees, similarly did not increase participant comprehension.",

However, as discussed in detail below, the Bureau also proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) to require that the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts include a statement at the top of the short form indicating that a consumer does not have to accept the payroll card account and instructing the consumer to ask the employer about other ways to receive his or her wages instead of receiving them via the payroll card account, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(b).

See also existing comment 10(e)(2)-1 and final comment 10(e)(2)-2. The Bureau believed it is important for consumers to realize they have the option of not receiving payment of wages via a payroll card account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form disclosure will help to ensure consumers are aware of this right. For this reason, the Bureau proposed that a notice be provided at the top of the short form for a payroll card account to highlight for consumers that they are not required to accept a particular payroll card account.",

Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) would have also cross-referenced proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2) for requirements regarding what notice to give a consumer when offering a government benefit account."

                        "Many industry commenters, including industry trade associations (including several that focus on payroll and employment issues), issuing banks, program managers, payment networks, as well as several employers, several State government agencies, and a think tank commented on this aspect of the proposal. Specifically, they expressed concern that the proposed compulsory use statement was negative and implies that the payroll or government benefit card is an inferior product, thereby discouraging its use. One commenter said the negative statement would, in effect, \u201cwarn away\u201d consumers from choosing a payroll card account or government benefit card. A number of industry commenters suggested alternative disclosure language that they said would render more neutral the statement proposed by the Bureau.",
                        "Several industry commenters also asserted out that many States allow employee wages paid only via electronic means; because there is no paper check option for receiving wages, the commenters concluded that unless the employee has a bank account that can receive direct deposits, the payroll card account would be the sole way to receive wages. Others noted that most State wage and hour laws already require disclosure of information about all wage payment options before an employee decides how to receive wages. One trade association stated that the Bureau should not require financial institutions to list all available wage payment options as part of the banner notice in the final rule, as it would be difficult for employers operating in multiple states who would need to have different forms for different states, but also stated that it would support such a disclosure if it were available as an alternative to the version the Bureau proposed.",
                        "Relatedly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, some industry commenters generally objected to the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) citing, among other things, State-required disclosure of certain fee discounts and waivers as a factor distinguishing these accounts from GPR cards. Other industry commenters recommended that the Bureau permit additional disclosures on the short form for these products, such as disclosure of State-required methods to access wages without incurring fees.",
                        "Conversely, a number of consumer group commenters supported the proposed disclosure requirements for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts generally. Their comments underscored the importance of the notice regarding payment options at the top of the short form disclosure, with some recommending an even more conspicuous disclosure, or an expanded disclosure explaining the benefit of direct deposit to a bank account as generally cheaper and more advantageous to the consumer than receiving funds via a payroll card account (or government benefit account). Some consumer groups recommended that the Bureau extend the banner notice requirement to other types of prepaid accounts that are not subject to Regulation E's compulsory use prohibition, such as those used to disburse students' financial aid, insurance proceeds, tax refunds, and needs-tested government benefits that are excluded from coverage under Regulation E generally. Some consumer groups also urged disclosure of additional information, such as alerting the consumer when payments stop (for example when the consumer leaves the job or no longer qualifies for benefits), instructing the consumer how to un-enroll from the prepaid program, and explicitly stating that the employer cannot require acceptance of the payroll card account as a condition of employment and cannot retaliate against an employee that does not accept a payroll card account.",
                        "A nonprofit organization representing the interests of restaurant workers submitted information gathered from a survey it conducted of 200 people employed by a company that compensates nearly half of its 140,000 hourly employees via payroll card. Survey results showed that, among other problems, 63 percent of employees surveyed reported that they were not told about all of the fees associated with the payroll card before it was issued to them and 26 percent reported not being allowed to choose an alternative method of payment.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iii) above, the office of a State Attorney General recommended free and unlimited withdrawal of wages via ATMs, stating that its research in its State revealed that ATMs were the most common way for payroll card accountholders to access their wages and that accountholders regularly incurred fees for ATM transactions."

First, the Bureau has modified the proposed regulatory text to permit financial institutions to choose between two statements regarding wage payment options for payroll cards. Second, the Bureau has added, in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), a provision to the final rule permitting financial institutions to include in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts a statement directing consumers to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting four new comments to further explain and clarify the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) and (B). Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 913(2), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed above. EFTA section 913(2) prohibits a person from requiring a consumer to establish an account for receipt of EFTs with a particular financial institution as a condition of employment or receipt of a government benefit. The Bureau believes it is important for consumers to realize they have the option of not receiving payment of wages or government benefits via a payroll card account or government benefit account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form disclosure will help to ensure consumers are aware of this right and can thus exercise their right. Further, the Bureau believes that requiring this disclosure is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts\u2014namely, that consumers have a choice regarding whether to accept the specific account. In addition, the Bureau believes that this disclosure will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts\u2014again, that consumers have a choice regarding whether to accept the specific account\u2014are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account."

Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7) would have provided that, if a financial institution did not provide a physical access device in connection with a prepaid account, this disclosure would have been required to appear at the URL or other entry point a consumer must visit to access the prepaid account electronically. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7) would have also stated that a disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device would not constitute a disclosure on the access device. Proposed comment 18(b)(7)-1 would have clarified that a consumer might use this information disclosed on the access device to contact a financial institution with a question about a prepaid account's terms and conditions, or to report when an unauthorized transaction has occurred involving a prepaid account.",

The Bureau has also removed from the regulatory text the explanation regarding disclosures made on an accompanying document and included it in final comment 18(f)-3, as discussed below. The Bureau is finalizing this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, because it will assist consumers in better understanding the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, even after they have acquired the account.",

Specifically, this comment now clarifies that the financial institution must provide this information to allow consumers to, for example, contact the financial institution to learn about the terms and conditions of the prepaid account, obtain prepaid account balance information, request a copy of transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) if the financial institution does not provide periodic statements pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.9(b), or notify the financial institution when the consumer believes that an unauthorized EFT occurred as required by \u00a7\u20091005.7(b)(2) and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(d)(1)(ii). Final comment 18(f)-3 also clarifies that a disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device does not constitute a disclosure on the access device. The Bureau believes it is important for a consumer to be able to access fee information, as well as check an account's balance, and have a means for reporting unauthorized transactions, even after a consumer has acquired a prepaid account. Disclosing telephone numbers on an access device will allow consumers to access this information, even if they are not in the location where they retained the disclosures or are unable to access disclosures via the internet."

Specifically, \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(1) and (3)(i) requires that a financial institution, after receiving notice that a consumer believes an EFT from the consumer's account was not authorized, must investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred (i.e., whether the transfer was unauthorized), within 10 business days (20 business days if the EFT occurred within 30 days of the first deposit to the account). Upon completion of the investigation, the financial institution must report the investigation's results to the consumer within three business days. After determining that an error occurred, the financial institution must correct an error within one business day.\n          Under EFTA section 909(b), the burden of proof is on the financial institution to show that an alleged error was in fact an authorized transaction; if the financial institution cannot establish proof of valid authorization, the financial institution must credit the consumer's account.",

Pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.11(d)(2), if the investigation establishes proof that the transaction was, in fact, authorized, the financial institution may reverse any provisional credit previously extended (assuming there are still available funds in the account).",

Notably, as set forth in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau also proposed an exception to the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution when a financial institution had not completed collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification for a prepaid account, assuming appropriate notice of the risk of not registering the prepaid account had been provided to the consumer. The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(c)-1 regarding the 120-day error resolution safe harbor provision, renumbered as comment 18(e)-1 and with the reference to payroll card accounts changed to prepaid accounts. The Bureau also proposed to extend existing comment 18(c)-2, regarding consumers electronically accessing their account history, to all prepaid accounts, renumbered as comment 18(e)-2. In that proposed comment, the reference to payroll card account was changed to prepaid account, plus one substantive modification to clarify that access to account information via a mobile application, as well as through a web browser, would constitute electronic access to an account for purposes of the timing provisions in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(1) and (2).

                        "Most industry commenters and all consumer group commenters generally supported the proposal to extend to all prepaid accounts the error resolution provisions currently applicable to payroll card accounts. At the same time, several industry commenters argued that prepaid accounts may have a higher incidence of fraudulently asserted errors than other accounts covered by Regulation E for a number of reasons, including that prepaid accounts are often purchased anonymously; prepaid cards are easier to abandon and are more frequently abandoned by consumers who quickly spend down the balance and discard the card; and prepaid consumers may not have any other ongoing relationship with the issuing bank or program manager. Requiring financial institutions to provide error resolution rights to all prepaid accounts, they argued, would thus result in unsustainable fraud losses for industry, leading to market exit and rising consumer costs. These commenters did not, however, provide any data or particular details in support of their assertions. To avoid this result, these commenters urged the Bureau to limit the application of the error resolution provisions to prepaid accounts in certain respects.",
                        "Several industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, a payment network, and an industry trade association, urged the Bureau not to require error resolution for certain types of prepaid accounts, such as reload packs or cards that cannot be reloaded.\n          These commenters argued that these products are not transaction account substitutes, and as such should not receive the same protections as other accounts covered under Regulation E. In addition, the commenters argued that fraudulently asserted error claims are more likely to occur on non-reloadable cards, since the cards are mostly unregistered and used for a short period of time. The commenters also stated that the operating margins on these types of cards are slim and argued that, therefore, the costs of providing complete limited liability and error resolution protections, including provisional credit, would outweigh any profits and thus force providers of such products to pass on costs to consumers or exit the market.",
                        "Some industry commenters, including several issuing banks, a payment network, and a number of trade associations, expressed particular concern about the requirement to extend provisional credit to prepaid accounts. The issuing bank commenters confirmed that they currently extend provisional credit where appropriate for most types of prepaid accounts. These issuing banks and other industry commenters argued, however, that a mandate requiring them to extend provisional credit would increase their fraud-related costs by emboldening wrongdoers to submit more fraudulent error claims. The commenters urged the Bureau to take one of several approaches to limit the provisional credit requirement. One group of commenters, including several issuing banks and a trade association, suggested that the provisional credit requirement be limited to prepaid accounts held by consumers with whom the issuer has an \u201congoing relationship,\u201d as evidenced, for example, by repeated electronic deposits to the prepaid account. Another group of commenters, including an industry trade association and an issuing bank, urged the Bureau not to require provisional credit for accounts or transaction types that exhibit characteristics correlated with a heightened risk of fraud. Commenters suggested varied and at times inconsistent ideas about what these characteristics might be, ranging from, for example, the age of the account, how soon after account opening the alleged error occurred, or whether the transaction occurred at the point of sale or at an ATM.",
                        "Commenters who recommended limiting provisional credit also argued that the aggregate amount of fraud losses related to provisional credit increases as the time period within which a financial institution must provide provisional credit decreases, and that 10 business days is not long enough to complete an investigation for errors asserted on prepaid accounts. Accordingly, a number of commenters urged the Bureau to extend the 10 business days permitted under \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(1) to 20 business days for all prepaid accounts, and 30 business days for prepaid accounts held by consumers who do not have an ongoing relationship with the financial institution. Similarly, a payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers requested that financial institutions have flexibility to delay granting provisional credit beyond 10 business days where a factors-based test indicated that there was a significant risk of loss related to the extension of provisional credit.",
                        "Consumer advocates, by contrast, argued against rolling back the provisional crediting requirements. They noted that prepaid accounts are used in substantially similar ways as traditional consumer transaction accounts and thus should receive protections for funds lost due to unauthorized use in the same timeframe as other accounts covered by Regulation E. The commenters repeatedly emphasized how important provisional credit can be for consumers, noting that many consumers who use prepaid cards have limited liquid assets and may put a substantial portion of those assets into their prepaid accounts. Without provisional credit, in the event of an unauthorized transfer, a consumer could be without critical funds for the duration of the financial institution's investigation\u2014up to 45 days, or 90 days in certain circumstances.",
                        "Several consumer groups also commented on the timelines in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2) governing when a consumer must report an unauthorized transfer in order to receive error resolution protections, arguing that the current regime is confusing. For example, they noted that the 120-day safe harbor in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2)(ii) is not disclosed on the error resolution notice required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(d)(1)(ii).\n          Consumers may not be aware, therefore, that a different time limit applies to their prepaid account, and may believe their error was timely reported when in fact it was not, or they may fail to report an error that they believed was no longer timely when in fact it was. In addition, the commenters stated that many consumers do not receive paper statements and never access their account information online, so, they argued, a timeline that runs from the date they access their account information should not apply to them. For these reasons, the consumer groups urged the Bureau to adopt a single, uniform time limit of 120 days from the date the transaction was posted to the consumer's account. A number of trade associations representing credit unions also argued that the error resolution reporting timeline should run from the date the transaction was posted to the consumer's account, for the reason that the posting date is an objective and easily discernible point in time. These commenters, however, urged the Bureau to make the timeline a uniform 60 days from the date the transaction was posted."

To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority pursuant to EFTA section 904(c) to modify the timing requirements of EFTA section 909(a).",
                        "The Bureau has considered the comments regarding the implications of extending all of Regulation E's error resolution requirements to prepaid accounts. The Bureau acknowledged in the proposal that prepaid accounts might present unique fraud risks that other transaction accounts may not. The Bureau also acknowledges that these risks may be especially heightened with respect to prepaid accounts that have not been or cannot be registered or whose cardholder identity has not or cannot be verified. It was for these reasons that the Bureau proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) to exempt financial institutions from the requirement to provide limited liability or error resolution protections, including provisional credit, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution had not completed its consumer identification and verification process. The Bureau is finalizing a limited exemption as to provisional credit, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) below, but is not exempting financial institutions from the general requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for such accounts.",
                        "The Bureau is not persuaded by commenters that the unique risks posed by prepaid accounts warrant modifications to Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution regime beyond the final rule's accommodation for provisional credit on unverified accounts. Indeed, the Bureau understands that most prepaid issuers already provide error resolution with respect to most prepaid accounts, in compliance with the Payroll Card Rule\u2009\n          (though, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau understands that most financial institutions do not provide provisional credit for accounts that cannot be registered). Indeed, in its Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, the Bureau found that across all agreements reviewed, 77.85 percent provided full error resolution with provisional credit protections; 12.31 percent provided error resolution with limitations on provisional credit; 9.23 percent provided error resolution without provisional credit; and 0.62 provided no error resolution protections.\n          The Bureau notes that industry commenters did not dispute the findings of the Bureau's Study nor did they provide any data or particular details in support of their premise that the Bureau's codification of their own existing practices would result in unsustainable fraud losses for the industry. The Bureau thus does not believe that modifications to Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution regime for all prepaid accounts is necessary, and in fact the Bureau has scaled back the exclusion for unverified accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), discussed below.",
                        "The Bureau also declines to categorically exempt non-reloadable cards from the error resolution requirements, as some industry commenters had urged. The Bureau notes that non-reloadable cards can be used to disburse large sums of money to consumers. For example, prepaid accounts that are used to disburse insurance proceeds, tax refunds, or non-recurring employment benefits such as bonuses or termination payments are\u2014or could be\u2014non-reloadable. The funds held in such accounts may be particularly important to a consumer, who may have, for example, lost a home or a job; error resolution is especially critical for a consumer in that position who has been victimized by fraud. The Bureau does not anticipate that the requirement to provide error resolution rights to non-reloadable cards specifically should place a significant regulatory burden on industry.",
                        "Likewise, the Bureau declines to exempt certain types of accounts or transactions from the requirement to provisionally credit a consumer's account in the event a financial institution takes longer than permitted by \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(1) (or \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(3)(i), as applicable) to investigate an error. The Bureau understands, as noted by consumer group commenters, that consumers who use prepaid accounts may have limited liquid assets and may place or hold a substantial portion of those assets in the prepaid account. Without provisional credit, in the event of an unauthorized transaction or other error, a consumer could be without access to those funds for as long as 90 days, a period of time that could cause a significant disruption to the consumer's household finances. In addition, the Bureau notes that there appears to be no industry consensus around the criteria the Bureau should use as a proxy for an account or transaction's relative riskiness for purposes of determining whether it should be excluded from the provisional credit requirements.\n          Finally, although a significant proportion of industry comment letters voiced some opposition to the proposed provisional crediting requirements, the Bureau understands that most financial institutions are already providing error resolution, including provisional credit, for most prepaid accounts. Therefore, once again, the Bureau does not believe that requiring provisional credit for most prepaid account types should add significant additional costs or otherwise be problematic for industry.",
                        "With respect to the suggestions that the Bureau extend the time periods that apply before a financial institution must extend provisional credit, the Bureau notes that, under both the proposal and the final rule, the 20-day time frame requested by some commenters already applies in some circumstances\u2014specifically, financial institutions may take up to 20 business days to investigate errors asserted with respect to transfers that occurred within 30 days of the date of the first deposit into the account.\n          In other words, new accounts, which some commenters indicated are more prone to fraudulent error claims, are already given a longer provisional crediting time frame under Regulation E.",
                        "With respect to the suggestion that financial institutions have 30 business days to investigate errors before provisionally crediting the consumer's account, the Bureau notes that, depending on calendar timing, 30 business days could be nearly as long or longer than the 45 calendar days financial institutions currently have to investigate claims when provisional credit is provided.\n          Thus, a rule that extended the pre-provisional credit investigation period to 30 business days would in effect be doing away with the provisional credit requirement altogether for prepaid accounts. For the reasons stated above, the Bureau believes that provisional credit is an important consumer protection, especially for consumers who rely on a prepaid account as the primary means to store and transact with their funds. The Bureau declines to adjust the investigation time periods in such a way as to essentially obviate the provisional credit requirements for prepaid accounts. Finally, with respect to the time limits that apply to a consumer's timely reporting of an error, the Bureau also declines to revise the applicable limits as requested by some commenters. Again, the Bureau notes that the 60-day limit governing how long a consumer has to report an unauthorized transfer is set by statute in EFTA section 908(a). The Bureau did not intend to generally revise that timeline in this rulemaking.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 18(e)-3 with a revision to correct an existing scrivener's error. That comment previously stated that financial institutions were not required to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.11 with respect to transfers that occurred more than 60 days prior to when a consumer accessed the account or the financial institution sent a written account history. This is a misstatement of existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) (renumbered in this final rule as \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2)(i)(A) and (B)), which state that financial institutions must comply with \u00a7\u20091005.11 with respect to notices of error received by the earlier of 60 days after the consumer accesses the account or 60 days after the financial institution sends a written history of the account upon the consumer's request."

                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) would have provided that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, if a financial institution disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice that is substantially similar to the proposed notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7, a financial institution would not be required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements under \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it has not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification.\n          However, once the consumer's identity had been verified, a financial institution would have had to limit the consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs and resolve any errors that occurred prior to verification subject to the timing requirements of existing \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.6 or 1005.11, or the modified timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e), as applicable.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(e)-4 would have explained that for the purpose of compliance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), consumer identifying information could include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or other government-issued identification number. The comment would have also explained that for an unauthorized transfer or an error asserted on a previously unverified prepaid account, whether a consumer has timely reported the unauthorized transfer or alleged error was based on the date the consumer contacted the financial institution to report the unauthorized transfer or alleged error, not the date the financial institution completed its customer identification and verification process. Comment 18(e)-4 would have further explained that for an error asserted on a previously unverified prepaid account, the time limits for a financial institution's investigation of errors pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.11(c) began on the day following the date the financial institution completed its customer identification and verification process. A financial institution may not delay completing its customer identification and verification process, or refuse to verify a consumer's identity, based on the consumer's assertion of an error.",
                        "The Bureau stated its understanding that financial institutions often conduct customer identification and verification at the onset of a relationship with a consumer, such as at the time a consumer signs up to receive wages via a payroll card account or when a consumer requests a GPR card online. For GPR cards purchased at retail stores, the financial institution may\u2014but does not always\u2014obtain customer-identifying information and perform verification at the time the consumer calls or goes online to activate the card. Because of restrictions imposed by FinCEN's Prepaid Access Rule\u2009\n          and the payment card networks' operating rules, among other things, the Bureau understood that customer identification and verification was almost always performed before a card can be reloaded, used to make cash withdrawals, or used to receive cash back at the point of sale. The Bureau believed that providers thus had an incentive to encourage consumers to register their cards to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of the consumer's use of the account.",
                        "Collection of consumer identifying information and verification of identity under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) would have included information collected, and identities verified, by a financial institution directly as well as by a service provider or agent of the institution. Thus, the Bureau expected that financial institutions providing prepaid accounts for purposes such as student financial aid disbursements or property or casualty insurance payments would likely not be able to avail themselves of the exclusion in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) because consumer identifying information was collected and consumers' identities verified by the financial institution, or a service provider or agent of the institution, prior to distribution of such prepaid accounts. The Bureau proposed to adopt the exemption for unverified accounts because it understood that a financial institution could face difficulties in determining whether an unauthorized transaction occurred if it did not know a prepaid accountholder's identity. For example, a financial institution could have a video recording provided by a merchant or ATM operator showing the card user, but without having identified the accountholder, it would have no way of knowing if the individual conducting the transaction is authorized to do so.",
                        "The Bureau believed that financial institutions would follow the customer identification and verification requirements set forth in FinCEN's CIP requirements for banks in 31 CFR 1020.220 or for providers and sellers of prepaid access in 31 CFR 1022.210(d)(1)(iv). However, it sought comment on whether FinCEN's regulations, as discussed above, were the appropriate standard to use for identification and verification of prepaid accountholders, or whether some other standard should be used. Further, the Bureau anticipated that when a consumer called to assert an error on an unverified account, the financial institution would inform the consumer of its policy regarding error resolution on unverified accounts and would begin the customer identification and verification process at that time. As noted previously, the Bureau believed that providers had an incentive to encourage consumers to register their cards to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of the consumer's use of the account. However, the Bureau sought comment on the accuracy of this assumption, and on whether the Bureau should impose a time limit for completion of the customer identification and verification process."

                        "All consumer group commenters expressed support for the Bureau's decision to extend error resolution and limited liability protections to prepaid accounts. Several consumer group commenters detailed at great length the importance of providing consumers\u2014especially consumers who may have a hard time making ends meet\u2014with recourse if their accounts are subject to error or fraud. Thus, while a number of consumer groups expressed cautious support for the proposed limitation on protections for unregistered accounts, stating that they believed it struck a good balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that the rule does not encourage additional fraudulent activity, a number of consumer groups urged the Bureau to revise proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) to require complete limited liability and error resolution for additional account or transaction types. Specifically, one consumer group urged the Bureau to always require limited liability and error resolution where the consumer has a proof of purchase, while another consumer group urged the Bureau to always require the protections with respect to send-money transactions since, it asserted, innocent errors were more likely to occur with respect to that type of transaction. Two other consumer groups asked the Bureau to expand the exclusion of government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) to explicitly extend to other account types with respect to which the financial institution collects personally identifiable information in order to disburse the funds. For example, they noted that, for accounts such as those used to disburse student loans or insurance proceeds, the financial institution must collect personally identifiable information about the account recipient before distributing the access device. For such accounts, the financial institution has the information it needs to verify a consumer's identity, and as such, should not be eligible for the exemption from the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections.",
                        "In addition, two consumer groups expressed concern that the Bureau's decision to exempt unregistered accounts from the requirement to provide error resolution and limited liability protections would incentivize issuers to avoid registering accounts. They urged the Bureau to require registration for all prepaid accounts, arguing that, if registration were not a requirement, financial institutions may try to prevent consumers from registering, and then use the fact of an account's non-registration and verification as a pretext for not providing that account with complete limited liability and error resolution protections. Going further, a city government agency for consumer affairs objected to any limitation on protections for unregistered accounts, arguing that consumers who do not have a chance to register their accounts before becoming victims of fraud nonetheless deserve equal protections under Regulation E.",
                        "Several industry commenters expressed support for the Bureau's approach in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) of not requiring limited liability or error resolution for accounts for which the financial institution had not completed its collection and verification of consumer identifying information. By contrast, there was significant industry opposition to the provision requiring that, once an account was registered and verified, financial institutions provide limited liability and error resolution rights, including provisional credit, for transactions that occurred prior to registration. One trade association stated that, for prepaid accounts for which customer identification and verification is attempted but cannot be completed, it would support those accounts receiving some error resolution protections pending completion of the process, but not provisional credit. Other commenters, including a number of trade associations, a program manager, and a payment processor, argued on the one hand that applying limited liability and error resolution provisions to pre-registration errors would greatly increase fraud losses, since it was extremely difficult to investigate an error that occurred before the financial institution knew the identity of the cardholder. On the other hand, these commenters argued that requiring full limited liability and error resolution protections for pre-registration errors would not confer significant additional benefits on consumers since it was unlikely that an error or fraudulent transaction would occur prior to registration.",
                        "A program manager and a credit union objected to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) for slightly different reasons: They viewed it as a requirement that financial institutions conduct consumer identification and identity verification for all prepaid accounts. The program manager, which manages non-reloadable, non-registrable prepaid cards, among other products, argued that not only did the exemption require financial institutions to offer account registration, but it essentially obligated financial institutions to undertake a robust identity verification process with respect to each consumer. Otherwise, consumers could register their accounts with fake names and still be entitled to provisional credit. The Bureau's proposal, the commenter argued, would therefore extend an account registration requirement to accounts that are not currently required to perform such a process under FinCEN regulations, such as single-use or non-reloadable accounts. Such a change to industry practice, it argued, would necessitate major software and systems revisions at a great cost to financial institutions and their customers.",
                        "With respect to the Bureau's request for comment on whether it should require financial institutions to adopt a specific standard for collecting and verifying a consumer's identity, several industry commenters, including program managers and a trade association, argued that financial institutions should retain discretion with respect to which registration standard they adopt. They argued further that, whereas the FinCEN standard is effective and should be deemed sufficient for purposes of analyzing whether the financial institution had adequate consumer identification procedures in place, it should not be adopted as the required standard because the goals underlying the FinCEN customer identification requirements\u2014preventing money laundering\u2014differ from those of the proposed rule. Another industry commenter disagreed, arguing that the Bureau should require a single uniform standard for consumer identification and verification, and that the FinCEN standard should be the standard adopted. According to this commenter, the FinCEN standard has been effective in monitoring and preventing fraud for other transaction account types, and as such should prove effective for screening the identities of prepaid accountholders as well."

Specifically, the Bureau has revised the limitation on a financial institution's requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for unregistered accounts. Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account. The Bureau has made several changes to \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) and its commentary to conform the proposed text to this revised formulation. In addition, it has added regulatory text and commentary, explained in more detail below, to address when a financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process, and to clarify that if, at the time the financial institution was required to provisionally credit an account, the financial institution had not yet completed its identification and verification process, the financial institution need not provisionally credit the account.",
                        "To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) with a modified limitation on financial institutions' requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution for accounts that have not completed the consumer identification and verification process.",
                        "As explained in greater detail below, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) revisions to clarify, in response to industry comments, that it is not requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification process for all prepaid accounts. Because it is concerned that this revision, on its own, would result in a class of un-registrable prepaid accounts that do not receive any limited liability or error resolution protections, however, the Bureau has also revised the scope of the exception in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3). Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account.",
                        "The Bureau agrees with commenters that the proposed rule left open the question of whether financial institution had to adopt a consumer identification and verification process, or whether certain prepaid account types that do not offer or require an account registration process could continue to allow their customers to use the cards anonymously. The Bureau believes that there are legitimate reasons a consumer may opt for a particular account type\u2014such as certain non-reloadable cards\u2014that allows him or her to remain anonymous. Similarly, the Bureau is sensitive to industry's concerns that requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification regime where they previously did not have one would result in increased costs and, potentially, decreased consumer access to certain prepaid account products. Accordingly, the Bureau has declined to finalize a requirement that all prepaid accounts offer some sort of registration process.",
                        "However, the Bureau is also concerned that financial institutions will choose not to offer registration or to delay completing registration as a way to avoid having to provide provisional credit. To that end, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(e)-5, which provides an example of when a financial institution has not concluded the consumer identification and verification process with respect to a particular consumer: The example describes a financial institution that initiates the identification and verification process by collecting identifying information about a consumer and informing the consumer of the nature of the outstanding information, but, despite efforts to obtain additional information from the consumer, is unable to conclude the process because of conflicting information about the consumer. For the same reasons, the Bureau is finalizing a clarification in new comment 18(e)-5 stating that a financial institution may not delay completing its customer identification and verification process or refuse to verify a consumer's identity based on a consumer's assertion of an error. The Bureau believes that, as stated above, financial institutions have an incentive to encourage consumers to register their accounts to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of consumers' use of their accounts.",
                        "To clarify that it is not requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification process for prepaid accounts, the Bureau has finalized a provision that makes clear that financial institutions that do not offer a process by which a consumer's identifying information is collected and identity verified have not completed the consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. As such, and as described in more specific detail below, with respect to such accounts that cannot be registered, the financial institution may avail itself of the limited exemption from the provisional credit requirements.",
                        "The Bureau is concerned, however, that adding this clarification would expand the scope of the limited exemption in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) in ways that would leave many vulnerable consumers unprotected. The Bureau agrees with the numerous consumer groups that emphasized the importance of limited liability and error resolution for prepaid consumers. In addition, while it is true that consumers may not generally use non-reloadable products as transaction account substitutes given that the funds will eventually be spent down in their entirety, the Bureau believes that extending protections to all broadly usable prepaid accounts is necessary to avoid consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts. Indeed, the Bureau notes that its testing showed that prepaid consumers currently expect prepaid products to be accompanied by protections for error or unauthorized use.",
                        "The Bureau is concerned, therefore, that \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), as revised by the clarification discussed above regarding un-registrable accounts, would leave such accounts without any limited liability and error resolution protections enforceable under Federal law during its entire existence, instead of only during the limited time before which a consumer registers his or her card. The Bureau did not intend to leave this entire class of prepaid accounts without such consumer protections. At the same time, as stated above, the Bureau acknowledges industry's concerns about the potential costs of having to extend provisional credit for accounts where the financial institution does not know and has not verified the consumer's identity.",
                        "To balance these concerns, the Bureau has revised the proposed limitation on the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3). Rather than limit the requirement to provide any limited liability and error resolution protections, the final rule only limits the requirement to extend provisional credit for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. Thus, under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i), with respect to accounts other than payroll card or government benefit accounts, a financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account if the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that prepaid account. In effect, revised \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i) now operates as an additional exception to \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i), akin to existing \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau has added a new \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) to make that clear. The Bureau is likewise adding a reference to new \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i) to clarify its operation.",
                        "The Bureau believes this revision is necessary to ensure that all prepaid account consumers have some recourse when they experience an unauthorized or erroneous transfer. While the Bureau considered whether to require limited liability and error resolution for unregistered accounts only when the accounts cannot be registered, the Bureau believes it is preferable to treat all unregistered accounts uniformly. Once again, the Bureau also believes this approach will help reduce consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts, especially in light of the Bureau's observations that prepaid consumers currently expect prepaid products to be protected against unauthorized use and other errors. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that, by revising the proposed limitation on the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution as described herein, the Bureau is aligning \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) with current industry practice. The Bureau believes the narrower limitation in revised \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i) addresses the majority of industry's concerns. Again, the Bureau understands that most prepaid issuers already offer limited liability and error resolution protections with respect to most account types they offer.\n          Indeed, many issuing bank commenters confirmed that they provide some limited liability and error resolution protections\u2014but no provisional credit\u2014for accounts that have not or cannot be registered. As such, the Bureau believes that the final rule generally reflects current industry practice and should not place a significant increased burden on financial institutions.",
                        "The Bureau is also revising the scope of the exclusion in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) beyond government benefit and payroll card accounts. As it noted in the proposal, the Bureau agrees with commenters that financial institutions providing prepaid accounts for purposes such as student financial aid disbursement or insurance payments should not be able to avail themselves of the exclusion in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), because consumer identifying information is typically collected and verified by the financial institution or its service provider prior to or as part of the acquisition process for those accounts.\n          In the proposal, the Bureau expressly excluded government benefit and payroll card accounts from \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) for a similar reason\u2014that is, because it believed financial institutions often conduct the consumer identification and verification at the onset of the relationship with a government benefit or payroll card account customer.\n          However, it did not expressly exclude from \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) other types of accounts that similarly collect and verify consumer information prior to or during the acquisition process. The Bureau is now finalizing commentary that clarifies that such accounts cannot avail themselves of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3).",
                        "Specifically, new comment 18(e)-6 states that a financial institution that collects and verifies consumer identifying information, or that obtains such information after it has been collected and verified by a third party, prior to or as part of the account acquisition process, is deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. The reference to a third party collecting the verified information is intended to codify the Bureau's understanding, stated in the proposal, that collection and verification of information can be done by the financial institution directly, as well as by a service provider or agent of the institution. The comment provides an example of a financial institution that obtains from a university the identifying information necessary to disburse funds to students via the financial institution's prepaid account. Such a financial institution, the example states, would be deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to those students' accounts.",
                        "Next, the Bureau believes that financial institutions should maintain discretion with respect to the type of consumer identification and verification process they adopt. As such, the Bureau is not finalizing a requirement that financial institutions adopt the FinCEN registration process, nor any other specific process for how to identify and verify an account, except that it is finalizing the guidance in proposed comment 18(e)-4 that consumer identifying information may include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number, or other government-issued identification number. The Bureau notes, however, that on March 21, 2016, the Board, the FDIC, the NCUA, the OCC, and FinCEN issued interagency guidance to clarify that the FinCEN registration requirements apply to the cardholders of general purpose prepaid cards that have the features of an account and are issued by a bank.\n          Specifically, the guidance states that a general purpose prepaid card should be treated as an account if it provides a customer with the ability to reload funds or provides a consumer with access to credit or overdraft features.",
                        "Instead of adopting a single standard for consumer registration, the Bureau is adopting several provisions and commentary to clarify when, for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i), a financial institution can assert that it has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. Together, the new provisions are intended to make clear that a financial institution is only required to extend provisional credit for accounts where it actually knows and has verified the consumer's identity.",
                        "Specifically, pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A), a financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process, provided the financial institution has disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering the account using a notice that is substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Next, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(B) states that a financial institution has not completed the identification and verification process where it has concluded the process but could not verify the consumer's identity, again provided the financial institution has disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering the account using a notice that is substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Although consumers will now receive limited liability and error resolution protections, except provisional credit, before their account is registered with the financial institution, the Bureau believes it is still important that consumers understand that their protections are more limited until they register their accounts. As such, the Bureau is still requiring financial institutions to provide a notice substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 in order to qualify for \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B).",
                        "Finally, as stated earlier, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(C) sets forth that a financial institution has not completed the process where the financial institution does not have a consumer identification and registration process by which the consumer can register the prepaid account. To qualify for this provision, a financial institution need not provide the notice in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 since the consumer cannot register his or her card to obtain provisional credit protections. For the same reason, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 18(e)-4. The proposed comment would have recounted that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) provided that, in order to take advantage of the exception from the requirement to comply with the limited liability and error resolution requirements, a financial institution would have had to disclose to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice substantially similar to paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Since the requirement to provide the notice in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 now appears in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B), but not in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii)(C), the statement is no longer accurate, and as such has been removed.",
                        "With respect to the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) that, once an account is verified, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for pre-verification errors, the Bureau has considered the comments objecting to this aspect of the proposal, but is finalizing the general approach in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(iii). To conform the proposed provision to the revisions discussed above (narrowing the scope of the exclusion set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i)), new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(iii) states that, if a consumer's account has been verified, a financial institution must comply with the provisions set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c) in full with respect to any errors that satisfy the timing requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.11, or the modified timing requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e), as applicable, including with respect to errors that occurred prior to verification. Thus, under the revised exclusion approach, once an account has been verified, financial institutions that take longer than 10 business days (or 20 business days, as applicable) to investigate a timely error report must provisionally credit the account with respect to an error, whether it occurred before or after the account was verified, in compliance with the applicable time limitations set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c).",
                        "The Bureau agrees with industry commenters that it is unlikely that there will be many unauthorized transfers between the time a consumer acquires a prepaid account and the time the consumer is able to register the account.\n          As such, the Bureau does not believe that a requirement to provide provisional credit protections for pre-registration transactions on a previously unregistered account should place a substantial burden on industry. The Bureau believes, however, that to the extent there are errors prior to verification, these could be significant\u2014they could, for example, involve the initial amount the consumer loaded onto the account at acquisition, which could be a significant sum. Further, the Bureau notes that existing provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.11 already accommodate for potential fraudulent error claims asserted with respect to new accounts. Under both the proposed and final rule, new accounts would receive the benefit of the extended 20-business day investigation timeline set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(3)(i).\n          Further, as set forth below, if, at the time the financial institution was supposed to provisionally credit the account, the financial institution had not yet completed its consumer identification and verification process, the financial institution is not required to extend provisional credit to that account.",
                        "The Bureau has made two other substantive revisions to address the timing requirements governing a financial institution's obligation to provide limited liability and error resolution rights once a consumer's account has been verified. First, the Bureau has removed a large portion of proposed comment 18(e)-4, which addressed the timelines for a consumer's timely report and a financial institution's timely investigation of an unauthorized transfer for accounts that were previously unverified. Because the final rule requires financial institutions to provide limited liability and error resolution rights to accounts regardless of whether or not they have been verified, the substance of that portion of the proposed comment is no longer applicable.",
                        "Second, as referenced above, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) to address circumstances where a financial institution verifies an account after a consumer reports an unauthorized transfer. Specifically, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) addresses a situation where, at the time the financial institution is required to provisionally credit the account, the financial institution has not yet completed its identification and verification process with respect to that account. New \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) states that, under that circumstance, the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i) (45 days) or (3)(ii) (90 days) to investigate and determine whether an error occurred, without provisionally crediting the account. The Bureau believes this clarification is necessary, as without it, a financial institution could be retroactively liable for failing to extend provisional credit in a timely manner pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(1), even though, under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(i), it was not required to extend such credit yet since it had not completed its consumer identification and verification process.",
                        "In addition to the changes outlined above, the Bureau has made several minor revisions for clarity and conformity with revisions to other parts of the rule."

                "EFTA section 909 addresses consumer liability and is implemented in \u00a7\u20091005.6. For accounts under Regulation E generally, including payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, \u00a7\u20091005.6(a) provides that a consumer may be held liable for an unauthorized EFT resulting from the loss or theft of an access device only if the financial institution has provided certain required disclosures and other conditions are met.\n        Pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.6(b)(1), if the consumer provides timely notice to the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability is the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers made before giving notice. Pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.6, if timely notice is not given, the consumer's liability is the lesser of $500 or the sum of (1) the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers occurring within two business days of learning of the loss/theft and (2) the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur after two business days but before notice is given to the financial institution. Section 1005.6(b)(3) provides, in part, that a consumer must report an unauthorized EFT that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of the financial institution's transmittal of the statement in order to avoid liability for subsequent transfers.",
                "Existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(3)(i) provides that, for payroll card accounts following the periodic statement alternative in existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b), the 60-day period in \u00a7\u20091005.6(b)(3) for reporting unauthorized transfers begins on the earlier of (1) the date the consumer electronically accesses his account under \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), provided that the electronic history made available to the consumer reflects the transfer, or (2) the date the financial institution sends a written history of the consumer's account transactions requested by the consumer under \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) in which the unauthorized transfer is first reflected. Alternatively, existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(3)(ii) provides that a financial institution may comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(3)(i) by limiting a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer as provided under \u00a7\u20091005.6(b)(3) for any transfer reported by the consumer within 120 days after the transfer was credited or debited to the consumer's account. The Bureau notes that this provision only modifies the 60-day period for consumers to report an unauthorized transfer and does not alter any other provision of \u00a7\u20091005.6.",
                "The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts the existing limited liability provisions of Regulation E with modifications to certain timing requirements for financial institutions following the periodic statement alternative in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1).\n        The text of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(1) featured certain minor modifications for consistency but otherwise was unchanged from existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(3).",
                "Several consumer groups urged the Bureau to harmonize the liability limitations provided under Regulation E with those provided in Regulation Z for credit cards. Under Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(b), a cardholder's liability for an unauthorized transfer cannot exceed $50; the payment networks' dispute rules, which apply to network-branded prepaid cards, generally apply the Regulation Z limitations on liability. The commenters argued that it is confusing to have different liability limitation amounts potentially apply to a transaction on the same card. The commenters argued that the limitation amounts in Regulation E should be reduced to $50, in line with the limitation amounts in Regulation Z.",
                "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(1) as proposed, with minor revisions for clarity and consistency. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA 904(c) to modify the timing requirements of EFTA 909(a). In addition, the Bureau has considered the modifications suggested by commenters, but declines to revise the liability limitations for prepaid accounts set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(1). The dollar amount a consumer may be liable for an unauthorized transfer is specified by statute in EFTA section 909(a)(1) and (2). These limitations already apply to payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts. The Bureau is not persuaded that the process of identifying or resolving errors with respect to prepaid accounts is sufficiently different from the process applied with respect to payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts to warrant a separate limited liability regime. Further, the Bureau believes that adopting a different limited liability regime for prepaid accounts than the regime currently in existence accounts generally under Regulation E would require many financial institutions to change their practices, since, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, the vast majority of programs reviewed in the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements already limit consumer liability in accordance with existing Regulation E provisions."

The Bureau notes that, to the extent certain accounts were already covered as accounts under existing Regulation E generally, these exclusions do not change that, and only exclude from the definition of prepaid account."

Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.60 sets forth disclosure requirements for credit and charge card application and solicitations commonly referred to as \u201cSchumer Box\u201d disclosures. Section 1026.60(b) lists the required disclosure elements, \u00a7\u20091026.60(a) contains general rules for such disclosures, and \u00a7\u20091026.60(c) contains specific requirements for direct mail and electronic applications and solicitations. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) would have explained that a credit plan that would be a credit card account under proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15) could be structured either as a credit plan that could be accessed through the same device that accesses the prepaid account, or through an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor offering the plan.",

The Bureau, however, believed it would be important for consumers who are considering whether to acquire a prepaid account to know not only if a credit plan could be offered at any point, as would have been required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(9), but also what the possible cost of such a plan might be. Because of the space constraints on the short form, as discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believed it would be appropriate for a consumer to receive as part of the long form disclosure more complete information about any credit plan that could be offered to them, even if they would not be solicited for such a plan until at least 30 days after registering a particular prepaid account pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) and proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h).",

It cautioned the information disclosed will likely be outdated by the time a consumer seeks or is offered such credit, and suggested that consumers may become confused or angry if the actual credit terms offered differ from those disclosed in the long form, which it said is likely considering the mandatory 30-day waiting period before solicitation and infrequency with which the proposed rule would have required updating disclosures in a retail location. It stated that this would result in stale Regulation Z disclosures, including the APR, that could be more than a year old at the time a consumer would actually apply for credit. The commenter suggested that the disclosures would confuse consumers who, upon seeing them in the long form disclosure, will likely assume credit is being or will be offered to them. The commenter also expressed concern that consumers seeking credit who do not ultimately qualify for it may be confused or angered and suspect the financial institution has engaged in discrimination or false advertising. Finally, the commenter expressed concern that consumers who do obtain credit may be confused by being provided with the Regulation Z disclosures again at the time of solicitation and, perhaps, with changed terms. In sum, the commenter recommended that the Bureau remove this long form requirement as likely to provide little consumer benefit but rather lead to significant consumer misunderstanding.",

Under the proposal, a financial institution would have been required to include the Regulation Z disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u20091026.60(a), (b), and (c).

                        "As discussed in the proposal and in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) above, the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be informed of the key costs and terms of an overdraft credit feature in order to be able to make informed purchase and use decisions with regard to both prepaid accounts and associated overdraft credit features\u2014even though they may not be eligible for the feature until after a waiting period or at all. In response to the comment suggesting that such information may become stale and cause consumer confusion or worse, the Bureau notes that Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.60(e)(1) permits inclusion in a prominent location in the disclosure of the date the required information was printed, including a statement that the required information was accurate as of that date and is subject to change after that date, as well as a statement and contact information regarding any change in the required information since it was printed. The Bureau has also added an additional provision to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, limiting the requirement to update these disclosures. For an overview of the Bureau's overall approach to regulating overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts, see the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section below.",

Given the organization of the long form disclosure and the placement of the Regulation Z disclosures at the end, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide financial institutions this option in case they deem it necessary or appropriate to include brief additional text to orient or explain to consumers to the ensuing disclosures.",
                        "Finally, the final rule provides that a financial institution is not required to revise the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii) to reflect a change in the fees or other terms disclosed therein until such time as the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the long form disclosure. In conjunction with the final rule's incorporation of the Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.60(e)(1) disclosures, the Bureau believes it would be inefficient to require financial institutions to update their long form disclosures (and their initial disclosures, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2)), each time a change is made to the fees and terms required to be included in the credit portion of that disclosure. The Bureau has thus added this exception, which mirrors the exception for third-party fees in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) discussed above.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(4)(vii)-1 provides guidance on where these disclosures must be located in the long form.

The Bureau continues to believe that consumers could more easily review these Regulation Z disclosures if they are on the same page as the rest of the long form information, although the Bureau understands that this may not be possible depending on the length of the prepaid account program's long form.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(4)(vii)-2 explains that the updating exception in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii) does not extend to any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final \u00a7\u20091026.61 that are required to be disclosed on the long form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii).

These commenters also argued that paper periodic statements are more convenient and easier to review for consumers who find it difficult to remember passwords or log into their online accounts, or for consumers who simply prefer paper over electronic statements.

One commenter added that statements would not make sense particularly for non-reloadable, low-value prepaid accounts, as these products are anonymous and do not have the functionality or associated fees of reloadable prepaid accounts, deposit accounts, or other traditional bank accounts. Some commenters argued that a periodic statement requirement would impose unnecessary costs and recordkeeping burdens and provide consumers little value, as they prefer immediate, electronic access to their account information and transaction history.

These commenters explained that financial institutions that do not have the proper infrastructure in place to meet the requirements of the alternative would need to invest in system upgrades and Web site development and coordinate with third-party data processors to obtain the information needed to provide periodic statements or account transaction history. Several of the credit union trade associations explained that most credit unions rely on third parties to maintain their Web sites and to provide the data for account transaction history; therefore, reliance on the third parties to capture the required information and to make necessary changes would require industry-wide coordination and may result in higher fees. Several other credit union trade associations argued that the proposed alternative would not be appropriate for prepaid accounts because prepaid accounts are generally seen as short-term or disposable products, and the consumer relationship typically lasts as long as there are funds available on the account. Relatedly, one think tank argued that government agencies would find it difficult to manage beneficiaries' account transaction histories for 18 months."

                        "The Bureau does not expect the alternative to be particularly burdensome for most financial institutions. As noted in the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements and other public studies, many financial institutions already follow the existing alternative from the Payroll Card Rule.\n          Because consumers need reliable access to account information to manage their prepaid accounts and to assist them when making financial decisions generally, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require that financial institutions must either provide a periodic statement or follow the alternative. Reliable access to account information is especially important since prepaid accounts have become more prevalent in recent years and are increasingly being used as replacements for traditional checking accounts; that is, they are no longer universally seen or used as short-term or disposable products. Regarding commenters' concerns about the costs and burden associated with the alternative, the Bureau believes the modifications it has made to the length of time electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, as discussed below, will help alleviate those concerns.",
                        "The Bureau declines to require all financial institutions to provide access to account information as required under the alternative, even if they provide periodic statements, as requested by a commenter, as it does not believe it to be necessary or appropriate to do so at this time. As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to adopt the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts in order to reduce some of the burden financial institutions experience with regard to mailing periodic statements. Requiring a financial institution to provide access to account information pursuant to the alternative, despite its election to provide periodic statements, would contradict the intended purpose of the alternative."

These commenters explained that text messages and email alerts provide a quick and easy way for consumers to be notified about low account balances and transactions made. One commenter stated that offering text message updates available at no charge can help consumers that have limited internet access and also assist financial institutions in identifying fraud and other unauthorized transactions more quickly. In addition, these commenters explained that consumers need access to customer service for a variety of reasons, such as to ask questions, check balances, dispute charges, and verify the receipt of wages and other transactions. Several commenters requested that the Bureau require foreign language support for customer service calls, particularly if a financial institution uses a foreign language in connection with the marketing or acquisition of a prepaid account.",

These commenters stated that text message and email alerts should be optional, so that financial institutions can determine the needs of their customers without unnecessary restrictions. These commenters also stated that providing various methods of access to account information can be costly to industry and therefore financial institutions should be permitted to charge consumers reasonable fees for certain methods of access."

The Bureau also believes that financial institutions can assess the methods of access that best meet the needs of their customers. For example, the Bureau is aware that many financial institutions already provide free text message and email alerts and access to customer service, as the competitive nature of the industry is moving financial institutions to offer these services.\n          However, the Bureau believes that the periodic statement requirement of \u00a7\u20091005.9(b) or the periodic statement alternative in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) is sufficient at this time to ensure that all prepaid consumers have access to their account information.",

The Bureau understands that financial institutions that market prepaid accounts in foreign languages generally offer customer service support in those languages and that some offer foreign language customer service support, particularly in Spanish, even if they do not engage in foreign language marketing. However, the Bureau has concerns about the costs and burdens to industry, if it were to formalize such a requirement in this final rule. While consumers will have the right to obtain, in certain situations, pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(9), the Bureau is concerned that a foreign-language customer-service requirement here could deter financial institutions from offering prepaid accounts in foreign languages because financial institutions would have to ensure, among other things, that live customer service in a foreign language is available at all times. However, the Bureau will continue to monitor industry practice in this area and may revisit this issue in a future rulemaking."

Existing \u00a7\u20091005.15(a)(2), in turn, defines the term \u201caccount\u201d to mean an account established by a government agency for distributing government benefits to a consumer electronically, such as through ATMs or POS terminals (not including an account for distributing needs-tested benefits in a program established under State or local law or administered by a State or local agency). The Bureau proposed to adjust the final sentence of \u00a7\u20091005.15(a)(1) to reflect that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15 would include substantive requirements, and not just exceptions to Regulation E requirements.

Numerous commenters asked the Bureau to clarify that government benefit accounts would continue to be covered under the existing requirements of Regulation E, rather than under the new requirements applying to prepaid accounts. One industry commenter, for example, argued that the final rule should exempt from coverage all cards used to distribute government benefits, regardless of whether such benefits are needs-tested. Other industry commenters asked the Bureau to exempt cards used to disburse certain types of benefits\u2014for example, child support, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation benefits. Currently, these commenters noted, the issuers of these cards administer the programs at no cost to the government agency disbursing the benefit, and at little cost to consumers. If saddled with the costs of complying with the various requirements of the proposed rule, they argued, these issuers may increase their fees or stop issuing government benefit cards altogether.",
                "Consumer group commenters, by contrast, advocated that the Bureau expand the scope of the \u201cgovernment benefit account\u201d definition to include additional account types, including accounts that are expressly exempted from Regulation E now. A significant number of consumer group commenters argued that the Bureau should clarify that the exemption for needs-tested government benefit programs established or administered under State or local law does not apply to prepaid accounts. According to these commenters, the rationales for the exemption were either outdated or should not apply to prepaid cards. For example, one consumer group commenter noted that the exemption was intended to relieve regulatory burden for State and local governments, whereas the vast majority of government benefit accounts today are administered by financial institutions that are well-equipped to handle Regulation E compliance. Commenters argued additionally that the recipients of needs-tested benefits are, by definition, the neediest of all prepaid consumers, and thus should be entitled to the full protections of the Bureau's final rule governing prepaid accounts.",
                "The Bureau has considered the comments but believes that changes to the scope of the government benefit account definition are not warranted at this time. As discussed above, the Bureau did not intend its proposed changes to the definition of government benefit account to affect the scope of \u00a7\u20091005.15's coverage, nor did it contemplate or seek comment on whether or how it should narrow or expand the scope of the definition in the final rule. The Bureau understands that the existing scope of the definition, which has been in place since 1997, is well-established and forms the basis of current industry, government, and consumer practices, and it is not persuaded that the policy rationales presented by the commenters warrant unsettling the status quo with respect to the scope of coverage for government benefit accounts. The Bureau likewise declines to exempt government benefit accounts from the new requirements of this final rule, as some industry commenters requested. As detailed in the following sections, the Bureau believes that this final rule's revisions to existing government benefit account requirements, such as the requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures and enhanced access to account information, will substantially benefit consumers by providing them with a full, accurate, and timely disclosure of all of their account's terms and fees, and by helping them gain a more complete picture of their account activity. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting the revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.15(a) as proposed."

Moreover, the relative complexity of the form, although off-putting to some participants, did not appear to alter testing results.\n        Most participants quickly understood that the columns in the table represented different potential fee plans and all were generally able to compare fees in that form with the fees in a general short form disclosure. In light of comments received on the proposed version of the multiple service plan short form and the results of the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the redesigned form, the Bureau is finalizing the rule permitting use of a short form disclosure for multiple service plans.",

The Bureau does not intend to disfavor any prepaid account program over another in its rule and seeks to avoid potential disruption to prepaid account programs offering multiple service plans. While the Bureau acknowledges that the relative complexity and density of the multiple service plan short form disclosure may render it somewhat less consumer friendly than the general short form disclosure, the Bureau believes the redesigned form will provide financial institutions with flexibility to accommodate disclosure of products with multiple service plans, while also retaining much of the standardization of the short form design that facilitates comprehension and comparison shopping for consumers.",

To illustrate, final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2)-1 states that, for example, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with one service plan for which a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee, may use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2).",

For clarity, the Bureau has addressed use of the multiple service plan short form for loyalty plans in the regulatory text of the final rule as described above. Final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2)-1 reiterates that a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service (e.g., a mobile phone service), often referred to as \u201cloyalty plans,\u201d may also use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2). The comment also explains that pricing variations based on whether a consumer elects to use a specific feature of a prepaid account, such as waiver of the monthly fee for consumers electing to receive direct deposit, does not constitute a loyalty plan. Final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2)-1 also cross-references final comment 18(b)(3)(iii)-1.ii for guidance on how to provide a single disclosure for like fees for multiple service plan short form disclosures."

Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-1 would have clarified that for purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, except for \u00a7\u20091005.17 (requirements for overdraft services), the term \u201cdebit card\u201d also included a prepaid card. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2 would have explained that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) applied only to cards, codes, or other devices that were acquired by or provided to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. For further guidance interpreting the phrase \u201ccard, code, or other device,\u201d proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2 would have referred to existing comments 20(a)-4 and -5.",
                "The Bureau received comment from an industry trade association asserting that defining a prepaid account as a \u201ccard, code, or other device\u201d may conflate the actual covered account with the access device that the consumer can use to transact or withdraw from that account. Upon further consideration, the Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i) to remove the phrase \u201ccard, code, or other device,\u201d so that the definition does not conflate the access device that may be used to access the underlying account with the account itself. The Bureau intends the definition of prepaid account to cover the account itself, not the device used to access it.",
                "The Bureau has also removed the reference to the prepaid account being an account that is \u201cnot otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\u201d As discussed below, the prepaid account definition's interaction with the existing definition of account in Regulation E is now addressed in other paragraphs of final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Specifically, excluded from the definition of prepaid account by new \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(3) are checking accounts, share draft accounts, and NOW accounts, while commentary to final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i) clarifies that other types of accounts, such as savings accounts, are excluded from the definition of prepaid account because they do not have the same primary functions.",
                "The Bureau has revised comment 2(b)(3)(i)-1 to state that for purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, unless where otherwise specified, the term debit card also includes a prepaid card. The Bureau has removed the proposed reference to \u00a7\u20091005.17 in this paragraph, as the Bureau's revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.17, discussed below, have rendered its reference here unnecessary.",
                "Finally, the Bureau has also removed the phrase \u201cestablished primarily for personal, family, or household purposes\u201d from the definition of prepaid account. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that phrase is unnecessary here as it already appears in the main definition of account in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(1), and prepaid accounts are expressly included as a subcategory within that broader definition. The Bureau has likewise removed proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2, which would have provided guidance with respect to the meaning of \u201cestablished primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d"

                        "The Bureau proposed an adjustment to the general pre-acquisition timing requirement where consumers acquired prepaid accounts in retail stores. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted financial institutions to employ an alternative method of delivering the long form disclosure. Under this alternative timing regime, a financial institution would have been permitted to provide the long form disclosure in writing after the consumer acquired a prepaid account as long as three conditions were met, as discussed below.",
                        "In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that in many cases it was not feasible for financial institutions that offered prepaid accounts in retail stores to provide printed long form disclosures prior to acquisition. For example, due to size and space limitations on standard J-hook display racks, the Bureau believed that many financial institutions would not have been able to present both the short form and long form disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) on the packaging without overhauling the packaging's design or otherwise adjusting the relevant retail space.",
                        "Nevertheless, the Bureau believed it was important that consumers be provided an opportunity to review both the short form and long form disclosures before acquisition. Thus, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted a financial institution to provide the long form disclosure after a consumer acquired a prepaid account in person in a retail store, as long as three conditions were met. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) would have set forth the first condition: That the access device for the prepaid account available for sale in a retail store had to be inside of a packaging material. This condition would have applied even if the product, when sold, was only a temporary access device. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(B) would have set forth the second condition: That the short form disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) had to be provided on or be visible through an outward-facing, external surface of a prepaid account access device's packaging material in the tabular format described in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii). The Bureau believed that financial institutions offering the majority of current prepaid accounts at retail would be able to satisfy this condition without altering the structure of the existing packaging.",
                        "The third condition, set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), would have required that a financial institution include the telephone number and URL a consumer could use to access the long form disclosure while in a retail store on the short form disclosure, as required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11). The Bureau believed that consumers should at least be able to access the long form disclosure by telephone or via a Web site, should they want to obtain comprehensive fee information. The Bureau believed that many consumers had the ability to access a Web site through the URL that would be listed on the short form disclosure when shopping for a prepaid account, but nonetheless also proposed that when a financial institution did not disclose the long form disclosure before a consumer acquired a prepaid account, the financial institution had to also make the long form disclosure available to a consumer by telephone. The Bureau acknowledged that it might be complicated for financial institutions to provide the long form disclosure by telephone. Further, the Bureau acknowledged that it may be harder for a consumer to understand the information in the long form disclosure when delivered orally. Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that if a consumer took the affirmative step to request additional information about a prepaid account by telephone when shopping in a retail store, it may have been more likely that the consumer was seeking out specific information not included on the short form disclosure, and that such a consumer would therefore be less likely to suffer from information overload.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have provided guidance on the definition of retail store. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have explained that, for purposes of the proposed requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail store was a location where a consumer could obtain a prepaid account in person and that was operated by an entity other than a financial institution or an agent of the financial institution. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have further clarified that a bank or credit union branch was not a retail store, but that drug stores and grocery stores at which a consumer can acquire a prepaid account could be retail stores. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have also clarified that a retail store that offered one financial institution's prepaid account products exclusively would be considered an agent of the financial institution, and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure would need to be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) in such settings.",
                        "The Bureau believed that if a financial institution was the sole provider of prepaid accounts in a given retail store, or was otherwise an agent of the financial institution, then it would be easier for the financial institution to manage the distribution of disclosures to consumers. The Bureau believed that financial institutions with such exclusive relationships should have fewer hurdles to providing both the short form and long form disclosures to a consumer before acquisition. Nevertheless, the Bureau sought comment on whether agents of the financial institution faced space constraints in retail stores that would have made it difficult to provide the short form and long form disclosures pre-acquisition.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 would have explained that disclosures were considered to have been provided post-acquisition if they were inside the packaging material accompanying a prepaid account access device that a consumer could not see or access before acquiring the prepaid account, or if it was not readily apparent to a consumer that he or she had the ability to access the disclosures inside of the packaging material. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 would also provide the example that if the packaging material is presented in a way that consumers would assume they must purchase the prepaid account before they can open the packaging material, the financial institution would be deemed to have provided disclosures post-acquisition.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-3 would have explained that a payroll card account offered to and accepted by consumers working in retail stores would not have been considered a prepaid account acquired in a retail store for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), and thus, a consumer would have had to receive the short form and long form disclosures pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i). The Bureau explained that it did not believe that there were space constraints involved in offering payroll card accounts to retail store employees. Finally, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-4 would have clarified that pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), a financial institution could make the long form accessible to a consumer by telephone and by a Web site by, for example, providing the long form disclosure by telephone using an interactive voice response system or by using a customer service agent."

                        "Industry commenters overwhelmingly supported the proposed retail store exception. Despite this general support, however, a large number of industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, trade associations, a payment network, and an advocacy organization advocating on behalf of business interests, generally opposed the proposition that neither financial institutions nor their agents could qualify for the proposed retail store exception. These commenters argued that the exclusion of financial institutions and their agents was unnecessary and did not reflect compliance and market realities. Specifically, the commenters asserted that the location of acquisition should not dictate the type of disclosure the consumer receive since, they said, the constraints of providing the long form disclosure in any in-person environment are the same. Thus, they argued, there is no basis for distinguishing between large retailers that carry multiple prepaid account programs and small retailers, who may have no choice but to carry only one financial institution's products, nor between retail stores and bank and credit union branches who may also sell prepaid accounts on J-hooks or in J-hook-style packaging. One program manager argued that the Bureau's failure to distinguish in this context between banks that issue prepaid accounts and smaller financial institutions, like credit unions or smaller banks, that only sell prepaid accounts issued by others, is inequitable in that it places a greater compliance burden on smaller institutions than comparable retailers would face. These commenters urged the Bureau to expand the application of the retail store exception to more or all in-person sales of prepaid accounts.",
                        "A subset of these commenters objected specifically to the proposed commentary stating that an entity is an agent of the financial institution for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) if it exclusively sells one financial institution's prepaid account products. These commenters argued that agency status should be an issue determined under State law. They explained that, under several States' laws, a financial institution must appoint any store that sells its products as its agent, which would make such store ineligible for the retail store exception as proposed. Commenters also argued that the exclusive retailer exclusion would be difficult to enforce. For example, they noted that retailers may not be aware that they were selling prepaid accounts from only one financial institution, especially as retailers often deal with a program manager rather than directly with the financial institution itself. The commenters also listed several circumstances under which a retail store could unwittingly become disqualified from the proposed retail store exception by inadvertently offering only that financial institution's prepaid accounts, including, for example, if a retail store offers two financial institutions' prepaid accounts, but the supply of one financial institution's products runs out.",
                        "Few consumer groups commented on this issue, but those that did, along with the office of a State Attorney General, opposed the retail store exception generally. They urged the Bureau to instead require that the long form disclosure be provided prior to acquisition in all scenarios because, they argued, consumers are more likely to pay attention to information disclosed on a physical form than on a Web site. They further noted that financial institutions could develop viable alternative disclosure methods that would allow them to disclose physical copies of both the short form and the long form prior to acquisition as part of the prepaid card package\u2014for example, the long form could be disclosed under a flap that could be secured to the package with a Velcro tab. These commenters did not comment, however, on the types of entities that should qualify for the retail store exception if the Bureau were to adopt such a regime in the final rule."

                    "paragraphs":[
                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) with modifications to the situations that qualify for the alternative timing regime for delivery of the long form disclosure for prepaid accounts sold at retail. In general, under the final rule, the alternative timing regime applies when a consumer acquires a prepaid account in person at a retail location, without regard to whether the location is operated by an agent of the financial institution. The final rule also clarifies, however, that financial institutions selling prepaid accounts in their own branches qualify for the exception only with respect to prepaid accounts that they do not themselves issue. Finally, the Bureau has made several minor revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary for clarity and consistency.",
                        "The Bureau has considered whether, as some consumer group commenters suggested, it might be more beneficial for consumers to see all of a prepaid account's fees pre-acquisition for prepaid accounts in all acquisition scenarios including at retail to avoid putting the burden on consumers to seek out additional information. The Bureau declines, however, to revise the proposed alternative timing regime for prepaid accounts sold at retail in this way, for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau also declines to permit post-acquisition disclosure of the long form in all in-person acquisition scenarios, as some industry commenters requested.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe that consumers benefit from receiving both the short form and the long form disclosures in writing prior to acquisition, because the disclosures serve different but complementary goals. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above for a detailed discussion of the reasons the Bureau is generally requiring that financial institutions provide both the short form and the long form disclosures pre-acquisition.",
                        "However, the Bureau is cognizant of the potentially significant cost to industry of providing the long form disclosure prior to acquisition at retail and the packaging adjustments that including such a disclosure would likely require based on the space constraints for products sold at retail. Specifically, commenters have confirmed the Bureau's understanding that, if it were to finalize a requirement that the long form disclosure be provided in writing prior to acquisition of a prepaid account in a retail environment, financial institutions would have to undertake a significant overhaul of current packaging designs.\n          As such, the Bureau continues to believe that such packaging adjustments would result in significant expense to industry and would likely increase the cost of prepaid accounts and limit the diversity of options available to consumers shopping for prepaid accounts at retail (assuming retailers maintain the same overall space for the display and sale of all prepaid accounts that they have now).",
                        "To balance these considerations, the Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary to broaden in certain respects the type of entity that qualifies for the retail location exception set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii). Under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), therefore, a financial institution is not required to provide the long form disclosures before a consumer acquires a prepaid account in person at a retail location; provided the following conditions are met: (A) The prepaid account access device is contained inside the packaging material; (B) the short form disclosures are provided on or are visible through an outward-facing, external surface of a prepaid account access device's packaging material; (C) the short form disclosures include the information set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that allows a consumer to access the long form disclosure by telephone and via a Web site; and (D) the long form disclosures are provided after the consumer acquires the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau is persuaded that, in certain cases, the constraints that apply in retail stores\u2014limited space, distribution of disclosures by someone other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account\u2014could also apply in the context of other in-person acquisition scenarios, such as in the branches of banks and credit unions that sell another financial institution's prepaid accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary to broaden the scope of the retail exception by referring to a retail location rather than a retail store. The Bureau does not believe that this shift in approach undermines the consumer protections offered by the Bureau's pre-acquisition disclosure regime generally. Rather, the Bureau continues to believe that its alternative timing regime, with certain modifications described below, strikes an appropriate balance by providing consumers with\u2014or with access to\u2014important disclosures before acquiring a prepaid account while recognizing the packaging and other constraints faced by financial institutions when selling prepaid accounts at retail. Further, the Bureau notes that the conditions placed on a financial institution's ability to use the exemption\u2014including that the short form disclosure appear on the outside of the packaging containing the card and list a telephone number and Web site URL the consumer can use to access the long form disclosure\u2009\n          \u2014should ensure that most consumers have access to comprehensive fee information while they shop.",
                        "The Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 to remove the commentary stating that a retail store must be operated by an entity other than a financial institution or a financial institution's agent, and giving specific examples of what type of entities would or would not qualify as retail stores. Instead, final comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 states that, for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail location is a store or other physical site where a consumer can purchase a prepaid account in person and that is operated by an entity other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe, however, that a financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts does not face the same challenges as in other retail locations, and in particular that it is far less difficult for such a financial institution to manage the distribution of disclosures to consumers. In addition, the Bureau believes it is unlikely that any financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts in its own branches also offers prepaid accounts issued by other financial institutions. The Bureau also understands, as stated in the proposal, that financial institutions selling their own prepaid accounts may be less dependent on the J-hook infrastructure to market their products to consumers. Thus, the Bureau believes it is still appropriate to exclude from the retail location exception financial institutions that sell their own prepaid accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 to clarify that a branch of a financial institution that offers its own prepaid accounts is not a retail location with respect to those accounts and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure must be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i).",
                        "Next, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) to make clear that, to qualify for the retail location exception, the financial institution must provide the long form disclosure after the consumer acquires the prepaid account. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted a financial institution, under certain conditions, to provide the long form disclosure after acquisition, but left open a possible interpretation that the financial institution could forego delivering the long form disclosure altogether, which was not the Bureau's intent. For clarity, therefore, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) to make delivery of the long form disclosure after acquisition an explicit requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii). The new provision does not set forth a specific time by which the long form disclosure must be provided after acquisition. In practice, however, the Bureau expects that compliance with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) will typically be accomplished in conjunction with compliance with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1), which provides that a financial institution must include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7, all of the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4). The initial disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7 must be provided prior to a consumer contracting for an EFT service or before the first EFT involving the account.",
                        "Relatedly, the Bureau has removed the portion of proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 that would have provided an example of when prepaid disclosures provided inside packaging material are provided post-acquisition, because it believes the other provisions of the rule make clear that, other than as set forth in the retail location exception in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), the short form and long form disclosures must both be provided to a consumer prior to acquiring the prepaid account. The Bureau is otherwise finalizing comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2, as well as comments 18(b)(1)(ii)-3 and -4, generally as proposed with minor modifications for clarity and consistency, as well as conforming changes to reflect the numbering changes elsewhere in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)."

                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) would have required disclosure of a telephone number and the unique URL of a Web site that a consumer may use to access the long form disclosure that would have been required under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) in a form substantially similar to the clauses set forth in proposed Model Forms A-10(c) and (d). Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) would have required this disclosure only when a financial institution chose not to provide a written form of the long form disclosure that would have been required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account at a retail store as described in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii). (Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) and (b) also included this language for government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts.) The Bureau believed that using either the telephone number or the Web site, a consumer would be able to access information about the fees listed in the long form disclosure, and any conditions on the applicability of those fees. As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believed that if consumers do not receive the long form disclosure in writing or by email before acquisition in a retail store, it is important that they are still able to access the information. The Bureau also believed it is important that the Web site URL be unique to ensure that a consumer can directly access the same type of stand-alone long form disclosure that would otherwise be provided pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) in written or electronic form before a consumer acquires a prepaid account.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11)-1 would have provided further details about the telephone number that would have been required to be included on the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) when a financial institution does not provide the long form disclosure before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed comment would have clarified that, for example, a financial institution could use a customer service agent or an interactive voice response system, to provide this disclosure. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11)-1 would have also explained that a consumer must not incur a fee to call this telephone number before acquiring a prepaid account. The telephone number disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) could be the same as the customer service number for which a financial institution may impose a fee on a consumer to use for other purposes, but a consumer could not incur any customer service or other transaction fees when calling this number to access the information set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) before acquiring a prepaid account in retail store.",
                        "The Bureau considered requiring that this number be toll-free, but ultimately decided that having a toll-free number is less important to consumers, most of whom use mobile phones and do not incur additional fees for making long distance calls, and such a requirement could impose a burden on smaller financial institutions because they would perhaps have to maintain a separate toll-free line just for their prepaid account products. The Bureau noted that some card networks may require financial institutions to maintain toll-free lines, and therefore believed that telephone numbers disclosed in such cases would likely be toll-free.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11)-2 would have provided further details about the Web site that would have been required to be included on the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) when a financial institution does not provide the long form disclosure before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed comment would have clarified that an entered URL that requires a consumer to navigate various other Web pages before viewing the long form disclosure would not comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11). The Bureau believed that consumers make acquisition decisions in retail stores relatively quickly\u2014often while standing\u2014and should not have to navigate different links to access the Web page that contains the long form disclosure.",
                        "Relatedly, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have required, among other things, that the URL disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) must not exceed 22 characters and must be meaningfully named. The Bureau explained that by meaningfully named, it meant a Web site URL that uses real words or phrases, particularly those related to the actual prepaid account product. The Bureau believed 22 characters is the maximum length of a Web site URL that can fit legibly on a short form disclosure on most existing retail packaging material. The Bureau further believed these parameters would ensure that a consumer can easily enter the Web site URL listed on the short form into a mobile device when shopping in a retail store in order to access the long form disclosure. Using a meaningfully named Web site URL would also ensure that it is easy for a consumer to understand, which the Bureau believed would increase the likelihood that a consumer would use the URL to seek out more information about a prepaid account product.",
                        "The Bureau also considered whether to require financial institutions to disclose an SMS short code, which might be easier to type than a Web site URL, that consumers could text to receive the Web site URL that links directly to the long form disclosure.\n          The Bureau decided against including this method because sending a text message using an SMS short code would still require a mobile phone capable of sending text messages, could incur costs for the consumer, and would require adequate reception in the retail location. The Bureau also considered, but did not propose, requiring that a quick response (QR) code be included in the short form but decided against it because a QR code would require a substantial amount of space on the small short form disclosure and QR code adoption remains low. The Bureau did, however, request comment on including SMS and QR codes in the short form disclosure."

An industry trade association supported the disclosure and recommended it for all short forms, not just those in retail settings, but arguing that inclusion of this information generally would render unnecessary pre-acquisition disclosure of the written long form. A member of a trade association for State government officials generally expressed concern about consumer confusion, positing that a consumer picking up the short form may not realize there is also a long form disclosure. A program manager requested clarification that the telephone number disclosed need not be the same number for all the financial institution's prepaid account programs but rather could correspond to a particular prepaid account program. Two consumer groups and a program manager recommended allowing, but not requiring, disclosure of an SMS or QR code to provide an additional easy method to access the long form disclosure for consumers who have smart phones. An office of a State Attorney General said the Bureau should require that the long form disclosure be provided in written form in all payroll settings as employees may have limited telephone and internet access. (The proposed and final rules, in fact, do require that a long form disclosure be provided pre-acquisition for payroll card accounts.)",
                        "Several industry commenters recommended eliminating the character limit and the \u201cmeaningfully named\u201d standard from the Web site URL. Specifically, an industry trade association and an issuing bank said that the limited space of the short form already requires brevity and a program manager said that use of real words and phrases does not mean web addresses will be easier to remember and that many recognizable trademarks and product names do not qualify as real words and phrases."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii), with certain modifications. The Bureau is requiring that all short forms contain a statement directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure to find details and conditions for all fees and services. For prepaid accounts offered at retail locations, this statement must include a telephone number and a Web site URL, as proposed. For clarity, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text the specific language for this statement. The requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) that the Web site URL be no more than 22 characters and must be meaningfully named has been relocated to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii). Also, this provision permits financial institutions to include an SMS code as part of the disclosure. In addition, comments 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11)-1 and -2, renumbered as 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 and -2, provide further clarification regarding disclosure of the telephone number and Web site URL. The Bureau has also made technical modifications to the rule and commentary for conformity and clarity.",
                        "The final rule requires a statement in the short form disclosure directing the consumer to the location of the long form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) to find details and conditions for all fees and services. For financial institutions offering prepaid accounts pursuant to the retail location exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), this statement must also include a telephone number and Web site URL that a consumer may use to directly, respectively, access an oral and an electronic version of the long form disclosure required under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4). The Bureau proposed this exception from the requirement to provide the long form disclosure pre-acquisition at retail in recognition of the space limitations inherent in selling prepaid accounts at retail. However, the Bureau continues to believe it is important for consumers to be able to access the long form disclosure through other modes prior to purchasing a prepaid account at retail. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the short form disclosure confirmed that nearly all participants understood they could find information about additional fees not disclosed on the prototype short form by visiting the Web site or calling the telephone number on the form.\n          Thus, in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii), the Bureau has retained the proposed requirement to include in the short form disclosure a telephone number and Web site URL that a consumer may use to access oral and electronic versions of the long form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) when the financial institution is offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii).",
                        "As stated above, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) to require disclosure in all short forms of a statement directing the consumer to the location of the long form to find details and conditions for all fees and services. Pursuant to the final rule, short form disclosures provided in locations other than retail locations are not required to disclose the additional information of a telephone number or Web site URL. Thus, the proposed disclosure remains the same in the final rule for financial institutions offering prepaid accounts pursuant to the retail location exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau is adopting the additional requirement that all short form disclosures contain a similar statement directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure to alert consumers that there is a comprehensive list of fees and information available to them and where to find it in order to help them make prepaid account purchase and use decisions. The location included in the statement required in a non-retail location might be, for example, the cardholder agreement or the Web site URL, or any other location where the consumer can locate the long form disclosure. While the long form disclosure may be readily accessible to consumers along with the short form in certain settings, the amount of information often provided to consumers prior to acquiring a prepaid account in some settings may obfuscate the existence of the more complete long form disclosure. The short form disclosure was designed to be a snapshot of key fees and information; thus it is an optimal place to alert consumers to its companion disclosure, the comprehensive long form. Finally, this change to the proposal helps standardize the short form disclosures, including those provided outside of retail locations, by requiring a parallel disclosure in all short forms directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure.",
                        "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) provides that this disclosure must be made using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cFind details and conditions for all fees and services in [location]\u201d or, for prepaid accounts offered at retail locations pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), made using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cFind details and conditions for all fees and services inside the package, or call [telephone number] or visit [Web site].\u201d",
                        "The Bureau declines to follow the recommendation of the commenter that all short forms, not just those provided in retail settings, disclose a telephone number and Web site URL through which to access the long form in lieu of requiring the written long form disclosure be provided pre-acquisition. For a full discussion of the Bureau's rationale for requiring disclosure of both a short form and a long form, see the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above. Also, the Bureau believes that providing consumers with written versions of required disclosures that they can keep, without requiring them to have access to the internet and a printer (or a telephone), is superior to limiting consumer access to such disclosures solely through a Web site or telephone number.",
                        "The Bureau has removed the requirement that the Web site URL provided be \u201cunique,\u201d and instead is requiring that both the telephone number and Web site URL provide the consumer with direct access, respectively, to an oral and an electronic version of the long form disclosure. This modification makes explicit the reasoning set forth in the proposed rule that a consumer must not be required to go through excessive steps or have to pay to access the electronic and oral disclosures required under this section. In addition, comments 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 and -2 provide further clarification of the direct access requirement for telephone number and Web site URL.",
                        "In the final rule, the Bureau has also relocated to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) the requirements that the Web site URL not exceed 22 characters and be meaningfully named from its location in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(i)(A), to consolidate the requirements regarding this Web site URL in a single place. As discussed above, several industry commenters recommended eliminating the character limit and the \u201cmeaningfully named\u201d standard from the Web site URL. The Bureau continues to believe that the character limit and the requirement that Web site URLs be meaningfully named is important for consumer comprehension and ease of use in a retail setting; for these reasons the Bureau is adopting these requirements in the final rule. The Bureau notes that the character limit and the meaningfully named standard are not meant to make the Web site URLs easier for consumers to remember later, but rather are meant to enable consumers to more easily and accurately enter them into a web browser on their mobile phones while in a retail location. The Bureau does not believe that a Web site URL containing a long string of meaningless letters and numbers would facilitate consumer access to the long form disclosure at a retail location. The Bureau is providing clarification in final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-2, as discussed below, that trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations are deemed to comply with the requirement of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the Web site URL be meaningfully named.",
                        "Finally, the Bureau is adopting the final rule with the added provision that a financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose an SMS code at the end of the statement disclosing the telephone number and Web site URL, if the SMS code can be accommodated on the same line of text as the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii). The Bureau agrees with industry and consumer group commenters that consumers could benefit from allowing financial institutions to provide an additional easy method to access the long form disclosure at retail locations. The Bureau believes that an SMS code can fit within the short form disclosure without sacrificing consumer engagement and comprehension. The Bureau is not permitting a QR code to be disclosed in the short form, however, because although potentially useful, a QR code would require a substantial amount of space on the small short form disclosure and, the Bureau believes, QR code adoption continues to remain low.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 clarifies that, to provide the long form disclosure by telephone, a financial institution could use a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system. In response to the commenter referenced above, the comment goes on to clarify that a financial institution could use a telephone number specifically dedicated to providing the long form disclosure or a more general customer service telephone number for the prepaid account program. It also provides an example of a financial institution that would be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) if a consumer navigates one or two prompts to reach the oral long form disclosure via a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system using either a specifically dedicated telephone number or a more general customer service telephone number.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-2 provides an example of a financial institution that requires a consumer to navigate various other Web pages before viewing the long form as one that would not be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii). The comment also clarifies that trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the Web site URL be meaningfully named and provides an example."

                        "The Bureau proposed several changes to \u00a7\u20091005.2(b), as discussed below. In sum, these changes would have created a broad new defined term, \u201cprepaid account,\u201d as a subcategory of the definition of \u201caccount\u201d in existing \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(1), and thus subject to Regulation E. As discussed in detail in the proposal, existing \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(1) defines an \u201caccount\u201d generally for purposes of Regulation E as a demand deposit (checking), savings, or other consumer asset account (other than an occasional or incidental credit balance in a credit plan) held directly or indirectly by a financial institution and established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. EFTA and existing Regulation E contain explicit provisions applying specifically to payroll card accounts, as well as accounts used for the distribution of government benefits in existing \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.18 and 1005.15, respectively. Gift cards, although not included in the \u00a7\u20091005.2(b) definition of account, are addressed specifically in \u00a7\u20091005.20. The Board, in adopting rules to include payroll card accounts within the ambit of Regulation E, explicitly stated that Regulation E did not, at that time, cover general spending cards to which a consumer might transfer by direct deposit some portion of the consumer's wages.\n          As a result, some regulators, the prepaid industry, and others had interpreted Regulation E as not applying to various types of prepaid products that are not payroll card accounts, accounts used for the distribution of government benefits, or gift cards.",
                        "After the Bureau assumed authority for implementing most of EFTA pursuant to the transfer of certain authorities from the Board to the Bureau under the Dodd-Frank Act, it analyzed whether other types of prepaid products not already specifically identified in Regulation E could or should be covered by the regulation. It first considered the applicability of EFTA to prepaid products. EFTA, among other things, governs transactions that involve an EFT to or from a consumer's account. It defines an account to be \u201ca demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account . . . as described in regulations of the Bureau, established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d\u2009\n          Insofar as the statute defines account broadly to include any other asset account and for the other reasons discussed below, the Bureau believed it was reasonable to interpret \u201caccount\u201d in EFTA to include prepaid accounts. Thus, it proposed to include prepaid accounts expressly within Regulation E's definition of account. To clarify the scope of the proposed rule and to modify Regulation E to reflect the characteristics of prepaid accounts, the Bureau proposed to modify the definition of \u201caccount\u201d under \u00a7\u20091005.2(b) to create a specific sub-definition for prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau believed that proposing to apply Regulation E to prepaid accounts was appropriate for several reasons. First, it concluded that consumers' use of prepaid products had evolved significantly since 2006, when the Board last examined the issue in the course of its payroll card account rulemaking. The Bureau noted that a substantial number of consumers could and do use prepaid accounts that involve substantial sums of money, in part because many have wages and/or benefits loaded onto prepaid cards through direct deposit.\n          In addition, consumers use prepaid cards for a variety of purposes, including making purchases, paying bills, and receiving payments.\n          Indeed, the Bureau noted that some consumers without other transaction accounts depend on prepaid cards to meet all of their payment account needs.\n          As a result, the Bureau believed that such products should be considered consumer asset accounts subject to EFTA and Regulation E.",
                        "Second, the Bureau concluded that inclusion aligned appropriately with the purposes of EFTA. The legislative history of EFTA indicates that Congress's primary goal was to protect consumers using EFT services. Although, at the time, providers of electronic payment services argued that enactment of EFTA was premature and that the electronic payment market should be allowed to develop further on its own, Congress believed that establishing a framework of rights and duties for all parties would benefit both consumers and providers. Likewise, in the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that it was appropriate to establish such a framework for prepaid accounts, because doing so would benefit both consumers and providers.",
                        "In addition, were it to finalize the proposal, the Bureau believed that consumers would be better able to assess the risks of using prepaid products. Indeed, the Bureau was concerned that because prepaid cards could be so similar to credit and debit cards (which are protected under Regulations Z and E), consumers may not realize that their prepaid cards lack the same benefits and protections as those other cards. The Bureau stated its belief that the proposal, if finalized, would serve to make those protections more consistent and eliminate a regulatory gap.",
                        "With these considerations in mind, the Bureau proposed to bring a broad range of prepaid products within the ambit of Regulation E and also proposed to modify certain substantive provisions of Regulation E as appropriate for different types of prepaid accounts. To facilitate this, the Bureau proposed to add a definition of \u201cprepaid account,\u201d the specifics of which are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses that follow, to the existing definition of \u201caccount\u201d in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b). In sum, the proposed definition would have created a broad general umbrella definition for prepaid accounts that are issued on a prepaid basis or loaded with funds thereafter and are usable to conduct transactions with merchants or at an ATM, or usable to facilitate P2P transfers. The definition would not have depended on whether such accounts were reloadable or non-reloadable. Payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts would have been subsumed within the broader definition, though still enumerated as specific subcategories for purposes of tailoring certain substantive rules. The Bureau noted that while not all prepaid products covered by the proposed definition could or would be used as full and ongoing transaction account substitutes, it was concerned that to try to carve out very specific types of products that were, or could be, used for short-term limited purposes would create substantial complexity and could result in consumer confusion as to what protections would apply to otherwise indistinguishable products. The proposed definition would have excluded accounts that were already subject to Regulation E."

                        "As with the comments the Bureau received in response to the ANPR, most commenters to the proposal (industry, consumer advocacy groups, and others) did not object to the general concept of bringing prepaid products within the ambit of Regulation E.\n          While there were some concerns from industry and others, discussed in more detail below, about exactly which types of prepaid products the Bureau might subject to Regulation E, most commenters favored inclusion of GPR cards. Among other reasons, several industry trade associations noted that insofar as many GPR card issuers and program managers already voluntarily comply with Regulation E, the Bureau should formalize GPR cards' inclusion in Regulation E as a means of standardizing protections for consumers.",
                        "A number of industry commenters, however, took issue with the Bureau's proposal to define prepaid account more broadly than just GPR cards. A number of these commenters, including program managers, a trade association, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, stated that the scope of the proposal's coverage was a significant departure from the Bureau's Prepaid ANPR, which they noted focused exclusively on GPR cards and like products. A number of commenters, including trade associations and an issuing bank, urged the Bureau to focus its rulemaking on products that could be used in the same ways as traditional transaction accounts. The commenters contrasted such products, which they contended include GPR cards, with products that have limitations on use, such as non-reloadable cards or so-called reload packs, which are cards that can only be used to load funds onto GPR cards. According to the commenters, products that had limited uses or functions were generally characterized by a more limited relationship between the issuer and consumer, which made these types of products inherently riskier\u2014from a fraud-prevention perspective\u2014and less profitable to financial institutions than GPR cards. The commenters asserted that if these more limited product types were covered under the definition of prepaid account, the cost of adding Regulation E protections may cause issuers of those products to discontinue offering them. A number of trade associations advocated that the Bureau specifically exclude non-reloadable cards for these reasons. Similarly, these and other commenters urged the Bureau to exclude reload packs.",
                        "Other industry commenters objected to the Bureau's decision to cover \u201cinnovative\u201d payment products, such as digital wallets capable of storing funds, mobile and electronic payments, mobile applications, and other products that were being or may one day be developed. A digital wallet provider argued for an explicit exemption for digital wallets, which it defined as card, code, or other device that is capable of accessing two or more payment credentials for purposes of making payment for goods and services at multiple unaffiliated merchants. According to the commenter, digital wallets and GPR cards should not be encompassed within the same regulatory regime because they have fundamentally different consumer use cases and functionalities, and as such are not viewed by consumers as interchangeable. For example, the commenter asserted, in contrast with GPR cards, digital wallets are used primarily to access payment credentials, not funds. The commenter further stated that, to the extent digital wallets store funds, such funds are almost always loaded onto the wallets as a result of a P2P transaction, not because the accountholder purposefully loads the wallet with funds for future use. In addition, the commenter argued, digital wallets do not present the same risks as prepaid accounts\u2014specifically, digital wallets charge lower fees than GPR cards and do not offer overdraft features.",
                        "Other commenters, including an issuing bank, several industry trade associations, a think tank, and a group of members of Congress, argued that if the Bureau's prepaid accounts rule applied to such products, it would stifle growth and innovation by imposing a one-size-fits-all regime on a diverse and evolving market. These commenters advocated that the Bureau take an incremental approach to broadening the definition of prepaid account by including GPR cards in this final rule, and reevaluating the possible addition of other products at a later time.",
                        "A subset of these commenters, joined by a number of additional trade associations, a payment network, and an issuing bank, argued that the proposed definition was ambiguous and vague. Specifically, these commenters argued that the proposed definition did not draw a sufficiently clear line between accounts that were already covered by Regulation E\u2014namely, demand deposit (checking) accounts, savings accounts, and other consumer asset accounts\u2014and accounts that would newly be covered as prepaid accounts. These commenters expressed concern that under the proposed definition certain accounts could qualify as both prepaid accounts subject to the augmented Regulation E requirements of the proposal and traditional bank accounts (or other consumer asset accounts) subject to existing Regulation E requirements. Relatedly, other commenters stated that certain prepaid account issuers already considered their products covered under Regulation E as consumer asset accounts. As a result, commenters asserted, essentially identical products could be subject to different consumer protection regimes, resulting in inconsistent consumer protections for similar products and heightened compliance risk stemming from industry's uncertainty regarding which regime their products fall under. These commenters urged the Bureau to create a clearer demarcation between prepaid accounts and other types of accounts. Specifically, commenters proposed that the Bureau add greater clarity by limiting the definition of prepaid account. They had various suggestions for how to limit the definition, including, inter alia, limiting it to GPR cards, accounts that can only be accessed by a physical card, accounts that are marketed and labeled as prepaid accounts, accounts held by a financial institution in an omnibus (or pooled) account structure, or accounts featuring some combination of these characteristics.",
                        "Consumer groups likewise urged the Bureau to apply Regulation E to those prepaid products that consumers can use as transaction account substitutes because, in part, consumers do not know that their prepaid products lack certain protections offered by other transaction accounts. The consumer groups diverged from industry commenters, however, by largely supporting the breadth of the Bureau's proposed definition. A number of groups agreed with the Bureau's decision to include both reloadable and non-reloadable accounts in the proposed definition, arguing that the focus of the definition should be on how the account is used, not on how it is loaded. A think tank argued that consumer usage supported covering non-reloadable cards, noting that one-third of prepaid account users in its survey do not reuse their account after the initial amount of funds was depleted. A number of consumer groups advocated that the Bureau expand the proposed definition further to include specific types of non-reloadable cards loaded by third parties, such as student loan disbursement cards and prison release cards. Other consumer groups argued that a broad definition was necessary to accommodate new and changing products. These commenters supported the Bureau's decision to cover mobile and virtual payment systems, arguing that, as payment systems evolve, it was important not to adopt a narrow definition that would permit evasion.",
                        "Some commenters also urged the Bureau to expand the scope of the definition of government benefit account so that it applied to more categories of government benefit programs. Those comments and the Bureau's response thereto are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.15(a) below."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing the rule to define the term \u201caccount\u201d under Regulation E to include a \u201cprepaid account,\u201d while making several revisions to the proposed definition of prepaid account, as summarized below and discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses that follow. EFTA section 903(2) defines an account broadly to be \u201ca demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account . . . as described in regulations of the Bureau, established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d Insofar as the statute defines account broadly to include any other asset account and for the other reasons discussed below, the Bureau believes it is reasonable to interpret account in EFTA to include prepaid accounts. In general, the Bureau declines to narrow the scope of the proposed definition to cover, for example, only GPR cards, reloadable accounts, or cards that otherwise function as transaction account substitutes, as some commenters had requested.",
                        "As it stated in the proposal, the Bureau recognizes that not all types of prepaid products lend themselves to permanent use as transaction account substitutes. Nevertheless, the Bureau continues to believe that the features of non-GPR card prepaid products as well as the ways consumers can and do use those products warrant Regulation E protection and that the prepaid regime provided in this final rule is the most appropriate regime to apply. Consumers can receive significant disbursements of funds\u2014such as tax refunds or pay-outs of home insurance proceeds\u2014on non-reloadable prepaid cards. They can then use such cards for a variety of purposes, including making purchases and paying bills, for which error resolution and other Regulation E protections could be important.\n          Indeed, even though some types of prepaid cards may not be reloadable, consumers who lack other transaction accounts may depend entirely on such cards to meet their payment account needs, at least until the cards are spent down.\n          Likewise, consumers increasingly use digital wallets to conduct daily financial transactions for which Regulation E protections are important. The Bureau is not convinced by the argument that digital wallets used in this fashion are fundamentally dissimilar to other types of prepaid accounts. Indeed, to the extent that they are used to access funds the consumer has deposited into the account in advance, the Bureau believes digital wallets operate very much like a prepaid account. The Bureau notes that the fact that digital wallets currently on the market may not charge usage fees, as one commenter asserted, may not hold true in the future, especially if these products become more widely used and the features and services offered broaden.",
                        "The Bureau is thus finalizing a definition of prepaid account that covers a range of products including GPR cards, as well as other products that may not be used as transaction account substitutes, such as certain non-reloadable accounts and digital wallets. The Bureau recognizes that the scope of the final rule's coverage extends beyond the types of accounts that were the primary focus of in the Prepaid ANPR, as some commenters remarked. The Bureau notes, however, that the ANPR also asked broader questions regarding the potential definitional scope for a prepaid rulemaking. While an ANPR is not a required part of the rulemaking process under the Administrative Procedures Act, the over 220 comments received in response helped inform the scope the Bureau's proposal. The Bureau notes in addition, and in response to comments from consumer groups, that the final rule's definition is broad enough to cover prepaid accounts used by consumers in various scenarios and for various purposes, so long as those accounts meet the specific provisions of the definition, as set forth below. This would include, for example, student loan disbursement cards and prison release cards that meet the other criteria set forth in the definition.",
                        "At the same time, the Bureau appreciates commenters' concerns that the single broad proposed umbrella definition could have created too much uncertainty as to treatment of products that were already subject to Regulation E prior to this rulemaking, and their concern that certain additional narrow categories of products should be excluded from the definition due to various unique circumstances. The Bureau has considered various avenues for addressing these concerns, including, as suggested by commenters, limiting coverage under the final rule to only GPR cards or to accounts held by a financial institution in an omnibus (or pooled) structure. As set forth in greater detail below, the Bureau has decided to add further clarity to the proposed definition by adding a reference to the way the account is marketed or labeled, as well as to the account's primary function. The Bureau is not finalizing a definition that would limit coverage to only GPR cards, as stated above, because it continues to believe that the features of non-GPR card prepaid products as well as the ways consumers can and do use those products warrant Regulation E protection. In addition, the Bureau declines to limit coverage under the definition to accounts held in a pooled account structure, because the Bureau believes that the characteristics that make an account a prepaid account should not be dependent on the product's back-office infrastructure.",
                        "In addition to minor changes to streamline the definition and sequence of the regulation, the Bureau has reorganized the structure of the definition and added certain wording to the final rule that is designed to more cleanly differentiate products that are subject to this final rule from those that are subject to general Regulation E. First, to streamline the definition and to eliminate redundancies, the Bureau is omitting the phrase \u201ccard, code, or other device, not otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which is established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes\u201d from final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i). Second, the Bureau is clarifying the scope of the definition by adding a reference to the way the account is marketed or labeled, as well as to the account's primary function. Under the final definition, therefore, an account is a prepaid account if it is a payroll card account or government benefit account; or it is marketed or labeled as \u201cprepaid,\u201d provided it is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs; or it meets all of the following criteria: (a) It is issued on a prepaid basis in a specified amount or not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter; (b) its primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers; and (c) it is not a checking account, share draft account, or NOW account.",
                        "The final rule also contains several additional exclusions from the definition of prepaid account for: (1) Accounts loaded only with funds from a dependent care assistance program or a transit or parking reimbursement arrangement; (2) accounts that are directly or indirectly established through a third party and loaded only with qualified disaster relief payments; and (3) the P2P functionality of accounts established by or through the U.S. government whose primary function is to conduct closed-loop transactions on U.S. military installations or vessels, or similar government facilities. Other than these clarifications and exclusions discussed herein, the Bureau does not intend the changed language in the final rule to significantly alter the scope of the proposed definition of the term prepaid account."

                        "Existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to provide an electronic history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account.",
                        "The Bureau proposed to extend this existing requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) to prepaid accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and to expand the length of time that online access must cover from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau proposed to extend this time period because it believed that based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, more than 60 days of account history may be, in many cases, beneficial for consumers. While recent account history is important for consumers tracking balances or monitoring for unauthorized transactions, a longer available account history serves a variety of potential purposes. For example, some consumers might need to demonstrate on-time bill payment or to compile year-end data for tax preparation purposes. The Bureau also believed that a consumer may realize during any given year that he or she needs financial records from the prior calendar year and that access to 18 months of prepaid account history would give the consumer six months into the next calendar year. In addition, based on pre-proposal outreach to prepaid account providers and publicly available studies, the Bureau believed that many prepaid accounts provide at least 12 months of account history and that, even if they do not, the cost of extending existing online histories to 18 months would be minimal.",
                        "Existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide a written history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions promptly in response to an oral or written request, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request. Similar to the requirement to provide electronic account transaction history, the Bureau proposed to extend this requirement to all prepaid accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) and to expand the length of time for which written history must be provided from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-1, which requires that the account transactions histories provided under existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) reflect transactions once they have been posted to the account, renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-1. In addition, the Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-2 regarding retainability of electronic account history renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-2.",
                        "The Bureau recognized that in certain situations, consumers' requests for written account information may exceed what would be required under the proposal; therefore, the Bureau proposed to clarify in proposed comment 18(c)-3 those instances where a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee for providing such information. Proposed comment 18(c)-3 would have included several examples of requests that exceed the requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) for providing account information and for which a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(c)-4 would have explained that a financial institution may provide fewer than 18 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been open for fewer than 18 months, the financial institution need only provide account information pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, this comment would have explained that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make any account or transaction information available. The proposed comment would have referenced existing comment 9(b)-3, which provides that, with respect to written periodic statements, a financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution."

                        "The Bureau received many comments requesting that it modify the time period that must be covered in a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history. Most consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposal to provide at least 18 months of account transaction history, noting the consumer benefits of having a longer time period and arguing that the impact on industry should be minimal because data storage costs continue to decrease and consumers rarely request copies of their account transaction history. These commenters also argued that\u2014contrary to the Bureau's proposal\u2014financial institutions should not be permitted to charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than the required time period, arguing that it should not cost more to print and mail older information than it is to print and mail newer information.",
                        "A few consumer groups argued, however, that a 24-month time period would be more appropriate than 18 months because consumers could identify seasonal patterns, and April 15 tax filers could access transactions earlier than March 15 of the previous year. One of these commenters explained that it could take months for unauthorized transactions to be recognized and months or years to complete fraud investigations and resolve disputes with third parties. This commenter also stated that 24 months would allow consumers to access a longer period of account history, which would be particularly helpful to consumers who are unable to print or save transaction history on a regular basis. These commenters also requested that written account transaction histories go back at least seven years, which they said would be consistent with some document retention policies, so that consumers who use prepaid accounts as primary transaction accounts could look up older charges in the event of a tax audit or when applying for a mortgage.",
                        "A number of industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations, and program managers, urged the Bureau to shorten the proposed 18-month time period and, relatedly, stated that financial institutions would need longer than the proposed nine-month compliance period to implement the requirement as proposed. These commenters argued that the potential costs to industry would outweigh any consumer benefit, since, in their experience, consumers rarely request 18 months of transaction history and do not currently use account transaction history for tax preparation purposes. Some industry commenters requested a 60-day time period, which they stated would be consistent with the current periodic statement alternative for payroll card accounts and with the error resolution and limited liability notification requirements under Regulation E. Other industry commenters requested a time period of no longer than 12 months, arguing that most financial institutions do not retain more than 12 months of account transaction history in a real-time online format, and therefore, requiring a longer time period would be problematic for financial institutions. These commenters also stated that 12 months would be sufficient for consumers to manage their accounts and would be consistent with consumer expectation. Several other industry commenters requested that the Bureau instead require financial institutions to provide consumers with a copy of their written account transaction history upon request once every 12 months at no cost and then allow financial institutions to charge a reasonable fee for any subsequent requests made during that 12-month time period. One of the credit union commenters argued that the time period to provide account transaction history should be left to the financial institution's discretion.",
                        "Several of these industry commenters argued that maintaining 18 months of account transaction history would result in significant costs to financial institutions. These commenters explained that storing and securing such information would lead to operational costs related to upgrading systems, changing record retention policies and procedures, and training personnel.\n          Several credit union trade associations argued that the proposed time period would be especially problematic for credit unions because they retain limited historical account information in their systems and rely on periodic statements if a member requests information beyond what is in their systems.",
                        "Several industry commenters explained some of the differences between the types of information needed to make available and provide electronic and written account transaction histories and the costs associated with maintaining each. These commenters stated that generally, information in a real-time, online database is necessary to make available electronic account transaction history, and archived information is retrieved to provide written account transaction history that extends beyond the time period retained in the real-time database. These commenters stated that real-time information is usually archived after 12 months of the account being opened or when the account is closed, if sooner, and typically retained for several years. They explained that real-time information is easier to access, but more expensive to maintain than archived information, and archived information is inexpensive to maintain, but can be difficult to access. These commenters therefore concluded that maintaining 18 months of electronic account transaction information would be costly because maintaining that length of real-time information is expensive. These commenters further argued that responding to one-off requests from consumers for 18 months of written account transaction history would also be problematic because archived information, although inexpensive to maintain, is usually restricted to certain personnel or stored with a third-party processor, who typically charges a fee to retrieve the information. These commenters also argued that mailing account transaction histories that cover a time period longer than 60 days would increase printing and mailing costs.",
                        "Despite the costs associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters stated that they would rather provide a longer period of written account transaction history than make available a longer period of electronic account transaction history, given that maintaining electronic history is more expensive. However, because of the cost and complexity associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to begin accumulating data as of the effective date of the final rule (until they have built up to 18 months of accumulated transaction history), rather than requiring financial institutions to make available or provide the full length of account transaction histories as of the effective date, to alleviate some of the compliance burden.",
                        "A few program managers suggested further modifications that they believed would help reduce the costs associated with the proposed periodic statement alternative. Two of these program managers urged the Bureau to allow financial institutions to charge a fee for responding to requests for written account transaction histories. Another requested that the Bureau expressly allow financial institutions to inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than the required time period."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) with modifications to revise the time periods a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history must cover. Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to make available electronic account transaction history that covers at least 12 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account, instead of 18 months as proposed. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide written account transaction history that covers at least 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, instead of 18 months as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe that, based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, access to more than 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history will be beneficial to consumers for a variety of reasons, such as monitoring for unauthorized transactions, tracking spending habits, demonstrating on-time bill payment, and compiling year-end data for tax preparation purposes.",
                        "However, based on the response from industry commenters, the Bureau is persuaded that providing 18 months of electronic account transaction history could be particularly burdensome to industry, especially since costs related to retaining electronic history increase as the time period lengthens. The Bureau believes that 12 months of electronic account transaction history is consistent with the length of history consumers expect to access online and should not be problematic for financial institutions since many already provide at least 12 months of account transaction history, as discussed by industry commenters. The Bureau thus believes this revision strikes the appropriate balance between burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for accessing electronic account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii).",
                        "Considering the costs associated with maintaining electronic account transaction history, as discussed by commenters, the Bureau declines at this time to require financial institutions to provide electronic account transaction history covering a time period longer than 12 months. However, under the final rule, consumers will be able to request 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), which the Bureau believes adequately addresses the various scenarios offered by consumer group commenters as to why consumers may need access to a longer period of account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau does not believe that the time period for electronic account transaction histories should be left to the financial institution's discretion, as requested by one commenter, because consistency across the market reduces any potential for consumer confusion and assures that sufficient history is available for all consumers.",
                        "With regard to written account transaction histories, under the final rule, consumers will benefit from having access to two full years of transaction information if needed, without requiring industry to absorb the expense of making that length of information available electronically on an ongoing basis. The Bureau declines to require financial institutions to provide seven years of written account transaction history, as suggested by several commenters. The Bureau believes that 24 months of written history upon request is sufficient to meet the needs of consumers and does not believe it is necessary at this time to require financial institutions to provide an even longer written account history upon request at no cost. Based on information received from industry commenters, the Bureau believes the requirement to provide 24 months of written account transaction history, in conjunction with the requirement to provide 12 months of electronic account transaction history under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii), strikes an appropriate balance in providing consumers with the information necessary to manage their accounts while not imposing undue burden on industry. As explained by these commenters, maintaining archived information, which a financial institution will likely need to retrieve to provide 24 months of written history, is less expensive than retaining the real-time information necessary for making electronic history available online. Moreover, because, as explained by some commenters, many financial institutions already retain several years of archived data and consumers do not typically request long periods of written history, the Bureau does not believe that maintaining, retrieving, and providing 24 months of written history upon request should be particularly burdensome to financial institutions. The Bureau notes that financial institutions are not required to provide written history for a longer period than what the consumer actually wants; a financial institution may, for example, inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than 24 months.",
                        "Furthermore, as explained in the proposal, the Bureau anticipates that, in general, written transaction account histories will be sent the next business day or soon after a financial institution receives the consumer's oral or written request. Financial institutions may also designate a specific telephone number for consumers to call and a specific address for consumers to write to request a written copy of their account transaction history.",
                        "Regarding industry commenters' concerns about the proposed nine-month compliance period, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(1) imposes a general effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule. However, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(3)(i) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) or 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may make available or provide the electronic and written histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) below for additional information about the final rule's effective dates and related accommodations.",
                        "The Bureau received no comments specifically addressing proposed comment 18(c)-1. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-1 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.",
                        "The Bureau received no comments regarding proposed comment 18(c)-2. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-2 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic history required under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-3 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications for consistency with the revised time periods in the regulatory text. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-3 clarifies that financial institutions may charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than 24 months. This comment also provides examples of requests that exceed the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule.",
                        "The Bureau declines at this time to permit financial institutions to charge consumers a fee for providing the written account transaction history required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), as suggested by some commenters. As with the electronic account transaction history required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii), the Bureau believes it is necessary for consumers to have free access to at least 24 months of written account transaction history to effectively manage their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that charging fees to consumers who make occasional requests for written histories could have a chilling effect on consumers' ability to obtain information about transactions and, thus, to exercise their error resolution rights. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for requesting written account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).",
                        "For the final rule, the Bureau has divided proposed comment 18(c)-4 into two, numbered as final comments 18(c)-4 and -5, to discuss the requirements for electronic and written account transaction history separately. The Bureau is finalizing the portion of comment 18(c)-4 addressing electronic account transaction history, with several modifications. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer explains that if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer states that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any account or transaction information. Given the revised time periods that electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, the Bureau has also removed from final comment 18(c)-4 the references to written account transaction history and, as discussed below, is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain separately the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-4 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.",
                        "Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. Final comment 18(c)-4 also explains that, if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. This comment cross-references comment 9(b)-3.\n          However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to require financial institutions to continue making access to electronic history available for closed and inactive accounts because consumers do not typically expect to access this information electronically once an account is closed or becomes inactive. The Bureau also believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide electronic access for closed and inactive accounts will reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal, and consumers will still have access to such information, if needed, in writing upon request as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).",
                        "As noted above, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history that had been addressed in proposed comment 18(c)-4. The Bureau is adopting the requirements substantially as proposed, with several minor modifications. Specifically, new comment 18(c)-5 explains that a financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. This comment also clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any written account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-5 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity."

                        "As discussed above, \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) currently requires financial institutions to provide certain initial disclosures when a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving a consumer's account. The Bureau proposed in revised \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) that, in addition to the initial disclosures that are usually provided in an account's terms and conditions document pursuant to existing \u00a7\u20091005.7(b), a financial institution would also have to provide a consumer with certain fee-related disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account. In the proposal, the Bureau explained its concerns as noted above that while some financial institutions were already providing limited disclosures to consumers prior to acquisition, consumers across a range of acquisition channels did not always have access to consistent and comprehensive information before selecting a prepaid account.",
                        "Based on its outreach and research, the Bureau explained in the proposal its understanding that some financial institutions were not disclosing the fees that consumers may find relevant to their acquisition decision until the account was purchased (or otherwise acquired), the packaging material was opened, and the consumer reviewed the enclosed account agreement document. To take just one example, one prepaid product the Bureau looked at imposed an inactivity fee after 90 days of no transactions, but this fee was not disclosed on an outward-facing external surface of the prepaid account access device's packaging material that was visible before purchase. Further, the Bureau expressed concern that new employees might have been receiving terms and conditions documents regarding payroll card accounts at the same time they received substantial other benefits-related paperwork, making the fees difficult for employees to comprehend while sorting through other important and time-sensitive documents. Similarly, certain providers of prepaid accounts online may have been presenting disclosures on their Web sites in a way that made it difficult for consumers to have the chance to review them prior to acquisition.",
                        "In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that, for several reasons, consumers in all acquisition scenarios would benefit from receiving these new pre-acquisition disclosures prior to contracting for an EFT service or before the first EFT was made involving the account, at which point they would receive the initial disclosures that \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) already requires.",
                        "First, the Bureau believed that pre-acquisition disclosures could limit the ability of financial institutions to obscure key fees. For example, many participants in the Bureau's consumer pre-proposal consumer testing reported incurring fees that they did not become aware of until after they purchased their prepaid account.\n          Several participants also admitted to having difficulty understanding the disclosures they received with their current prepaid accounts and were very unsure as to whether key fees had been disclosed before they acquired the accounts.\n          The Bureau believes that its pre-acquisition disclosure regime will reduce the likelihood that these problems recur.",
                        "Second, the Bureau believed that, in order to comparison shop among products, it is helpful for consumers to be able to review disclosures setting forth key terms in like ways before choosing a product. The Bureau recognized that consumers offered prepaid products by third parties like employers or educational institutions may be unable to easily comparison shop. For example, at the time students are offered a student card from their university, such as when registering for school, they might be unable to compare that card with other products. The Bureau believed, however, that even in this scenario, students benefit from receiving the short form and the long form disclosure so that they can better understand the product's terms before deciding to accept it. Additionally, the Bureau believed that both the short and long form disclosures could inform the way in which these consumers decide to use the product once they acquired it.",
                        "Third, the Bureau believed that consumers could use their prepaid account for an extended period of time and potentially incur substantial fees over that time. For example, the Bureau noted that, during its pre-proposal consumer testing, participants indicated that they tend to use a given prepaid account, even one they do not like, at least until they spend the entirety of the initial load amount, which could be as much as $500, paying whatever fees are incurred in the course of doing so. Other research is consistent. Specifically, the Bureau cited to one study that indicated that prepaid accounts receiving direct deposit of government benefits might have life spans of as long as three years, and consumers who receive non-government direct deposit on their accounts use them on average for longer than one year.\n          Thus, the Bureau believed that whatever disclosure information a consumer used when selecting a prepaid account could have a significant and potentially long-term impact, especially if a consumer chooses to receive direct deposit into a prepaid account.",
                        "Regulation E, however, currently only provides for initial disclosures to be delivered at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving a consumer's account. The Bureau was concerned that, in the prepaid account context, this might sometimes be too late. With prepaid accounts, consumers often contract for an EFT service when acquiring the prepaid account and completing an initial load. The Bureau was concerned that, under the timing requirements for initial disclosures in \u00a7\u20091005.7, consumers were receiving fee-related disclosures too late to use them in their decision-making and comparison-shopping. The Bureau therefore proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i), which would have required a financial institution, in most cases, to provide the short form and long form disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed to add comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1, which would have provided examples of what would and would not qualify as providing disclosures pre-acquisition in the bank branch and payroll contexts. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 would have provided further explanation regarding circumstances when short form and long form disclosures would have been considered to have been delivered after a consumer acquires a prepaid account, and thus in violation of the timing requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i)."

                        "As with the timing of acquisition of a government benefit account, discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) above, the Bureau received numerous comments requesting that it provide further clarification on the meaning of the term acquisition in the payroll card context.",
                        "A number of commenters urged that, as with government benefit accounts, acquisition in the payroll card account context should be defined as the point at which the consumer chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account. These commenters included issuers, program managers, employers that use payroll card accounts, a think tank, and trade associations representing the prepaid industry and payroll and human resource professionals. The commenters argued in support of defining acquisition as the point of consumer choice because it has already been adopted in several states' wage and hour laws, emphasizing that those laws have the same purpose as this rule: to ensure that employees are aware that they have options with regard to how they get paid. The commenters argued that alternative approaches\u2014for example, defining acquisition as the point at which an employee takes physical possession of a payroll card\u2014could cause significant disruption to current industry practice. Under current practice, they asserted, an employee may arrive on the first day of work and receive a package containing an inactive payroll card account, disclosures related to that account, and additional information regarding payroll, benefits, and other work-related issues. According to commenters, this practice is beneficial to employees, as an employee is more likely to be engaged in the on-boarding process and to ask questions about the payroll card on that first day than at some later time, so distributing the card and disclosures together in that circumstance maximizes the chances that the employee will review the disclosures and ask related questions. Further, these commenters asserted, an employee who possesses a physical payroll card has at least one way of receiving his pay. If he chooses the payroll card, they argued, he will be paid quickly and without much hassle, in contrast to paper checks, which can take time to clear and cost money to cash or deposit, or direct deposit, which requires the employee to submit additional information to the employer in order to set up.",
                        "One employer that uses payroll card accounts to distribute wages to its employees argued that acquisition should mean either the point at which a consumer affirmatively chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account, or the point at which a consumer fails to make a choice from among a previously-presented list of available payment options. According to this commenter, some employers provide payroll cards as the default payment option if an employee fails to affirmatively elect a payment option. This practice, the commenter maintained, should be allowed to continue so long as the employee is notified (and where permitted by State law).",
                        "On the other hand, a number of consumer groups stated that under current payroll card disbursement processes, there have been continuing reports of employers steering employees to select payroll card accounts as their payment method. Such reports, they maintained, show that current methods for distributing payroll cards or disclosures do not sufficiently ensure that employees have the time and information they need to evaluate or choose an alternative payment method. Relatedly, two consumer groups also argued that employees should be given a minimum number of days (seven, according to one commenter, and 30, according to the other) before they are required to select a method of payment. Other commenters did not suggest a specific point in time for defining acquisition. Rather, they urged the Bureau to define acquisition in a way that ensures employees receive the pre-acquisition disclosures earlier than they currently receive the initial account opening disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7.",
                        "With respect to online acquisition, a digital wallet provider argued that the point of acquisition for a digital wallet should be the point at which the consumer's account first holds a balance, not the point at which the consumer sets up or opens the account. Prior to the point at which the account holds a balance, the commenter argued, the pre-acquisition disclosures are irrelevant and may confuse consumers and cause them to abandon the online sign-up process. In addition, the commenter urged the Bureau to revise proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to allow digital wallet providers to collect personally identifiable information before providing the disclosures. The commenter noted that these providers have to collect certain information in order to open the account. In a similar vein, a program manager asked the Bureau to clarify that the collection of certain personally identifiable information from a consumer does not by itself constitute \u201cacquisition.\u201d The commenter provided the example of an individual who goes online and submits her name and address in order to receive more information about a prepaid product by mail. The commenter was concerned that proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 could be read to require the financial institution to provide the short and long form disclosures before the consumer submitted this information, even if the consumer was providing the information on a third-party Web site while seeking information about multiple prepaid account products.",
                        "Also with respect to online acquisition of accounts, a consumer group commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that consumers must be shown both the short form and long form prior to acquiring the account, not just provided a link to them. The commenter argued that there was a lack of clarity in proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 around this point, since the comment both states that the consumer should not be able to easily bypass the disclosures, and that the financial institution can include a link to the long form on the same Web page as it discloses the short form."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) largely as proposed, with a technical revision. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comments 18(b)(1)(i)-1 and -2 with several revisions. First, the Bureau has added guidance in comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 to clarify that for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i), a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid card. Second, the Bureau has added clarification to comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.ii to explain that, in the context of payroll card accounts, short form and long form disclosures are provided pre-acquisition if they were provided before a consumer chose to receive wages via a payroll card. Third, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to clarify that a consumer who goes online to obtain more information about a prepaid account does not acquire a prepaid account by providing personally identifiable information in the process. The comment also provides additional examples of when a consumer who acquires a prepaid account electronically receives the short form and long comments for clarity and consistency.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i), as well as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) discussed below, pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that adjustment of the timing and fee requirements and the disclosure language is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts.",
                        "Specifically, the Bureau has added language to comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 stating that a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account. The Bureau agrees with commenters that additional clarity was needed around the use of the term acquisition in circumstances where the consumer does not purchase the prepaid account. Accordingly, the Bureau has included such terms as \u201copening\u201d or \u201cchoosing to be paid\u201d in the commentary to clarify the point in time at which consumers acquire a prepaid account in circumstances other than the retail scenario. The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.i, which includes an example of the acquisition timing requirements in the context of a bank branch, largely as proposed, with minor revisions for conformity with changes elsewhere in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b).",
                        "For similar reasons, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.ii to clarify that, in the payroll card account context, a consumer who is provided with a payroll card and the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) at the time he or she learns that he or she can receive wages via a payroll card account, but before the consumer chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account, is provided with the disclosures prior to acquisition. The final comment explains that, if a consumer receives the disclosures after the consumer receives the first payroll payment on the payroll card, those disclosures were provided post-acquisition, in violation of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i).",
                        "As above with respect to the timing of acquisition of a government benefit card, the Bureau has attempted to strike a balance that ensures that employees receive the new disclosures early enough to inform their payment choices, thereby furthering the goals of the compulsory use prohibition in \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2), while minimizing the potential disruption to current employer practices. Further, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) above, the Bureau believes it is important that consumers have a choice with respect to how they receive their wages or salary. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a rule requiring financial institutions to provide their new disclosures before the consumer chooses a method of payment. Under the final rule, therefore, consumers must receive both the short form and long form disclosures (which include on the short form disclosure a notice informing consumers they have other options besides the payroll card account to receive their wages) before they choose the payment method that is best for them.",
                        "The Bureau declines to require a mandatory waiting period between the time consumers receive the disclosures and the time they are required to elect a payment method, for the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) and 1005.15(c) above. Specifically, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary at this time to specify a single time period that would apply in all enrollment scenarios.",
                        "Further, the Bureau is aware that, as noted by an employer commenter and as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) above, consumers are sometimes given a choice between two or more payment alternatives, but may fail to indicate their preference. Depending on the facts and circumstances\u2014for example, the date by which the consumer has to be paid her wages under State law\u2014it may be reasonable for a financial institution or other person in this scenario to employ a reasonable default enrollment method. However, the Bureau is concerned about reports from consumer group commenters of employees being coerced to accept payroll card accounts as their default method of receiving wages and intends to monitor the payroll card account market for compliance with the compulsory use prohibition and will consider further action in a future rulemaking if necessary. As stated above, the Bureau also believes that by requiring the disclosures to be provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, the final rule will help ensure that all prepaid consumers, including employees receiving payroll card accounts, have the information they need to evaluate the prepaid account option (or options) available to them.",
                        "With respect to proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2, regarding the timing for delivery of disclosures provided electronically, the Bureau understands that the digital wallet acquisition process may in some respects be different than the acquisition process for other prepaid accounts. However, the Bureau does not believe that this warrants different treatment for purposes of the timing requirement for delivery of pre-acquisition disclosures. In particular, the Bureau notes that the fact that a digital wallet consumer could receive the disclosures before the wallet holds any funds is not unique to digital wallets. Indeed, to qualify as a prepaid account, an account must be issued on a prepaid basis or be capable of being loaded with funds after acquisition.\n          The Bureau believes that it is important that consumers are informed of the fees and other key terms that will apply to their prepaid account before they open or purchase that account, whether that account is accessed by a physical prepaid card, a digital wallet, or through some other means. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that digital wallet providers presently provide some disclosures (for instance, user agreements and privacy policies) prior to a consumer opening an account. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that requiring digital wallet providers to provide the short form and long form disclosures before the consumer opens the account should be problematic for financial institutions or confusing to consumers.",
                        "Next, the Bureau has removed the reference in proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to a consumer's provision of personally identifiable information. The Bureau understands that there may be scenarios in which a consumer provides personal information, such as name or address, in order to obtain more information about a particular product. Likewise, there could be instances where a consumer provides personal information for one purpose online, and that information is then used for other purposes, such as to market a prepaid account to the consumer. In either scenario, the consumer did not provide the personal information in order to acquire the prepaid account. Final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2, therefore, no longer states that a consumer who receives the disclosures after the consumer provides personally identifiable information has received the disclosures post-acquisition. Instead, the comment states that the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) may be provided before or after a consumer has initiated the acquisition process. If the disclosures are presented after a consumer initiates the acquisition process such disclosures are made pre-acquisition if the consumer receives them before choosing to accept the prepaid account.",
                        "Finally, with respect to consumer groups' requests that the Bureau clarify that a consumer must be shown both the short form and long form disclosures prior to a consumer's acquisition of a prepaid account through electronic means, the Bureau has added several examples in final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to illustrate disclosure methods that would comply with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i). In the first example, set forth in new paragraph i, the financial institution presents the short form, long form, and \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) disclosures on the same Web page, which the consumer must view before choosing to accept the prepaid account. In the second example, set forth in new paragraph ii, the financial institution presents the short form and \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) disclosures on one Web page, together with a link that directs the consumer to a separate Web page containing the long form disclosure, which the consumer must also view before choosing to accept the prepaid account. Finally, in the third example, set forth in new paragraph iii, the financial institution presents on a Web page the short form and \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) disclosures, followed by the initial disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) containing the long form disclosure in accordance with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1), on the same Web page. The financial institution includes a link, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii), that directs the consumer to the section of the initial disclosures containing the long form disclosure. The consumer must view this Web page containing the two disclosures prior to choosing to accept the prepaid account.",
                        "These comments are intended to clarify that a consumer does not receive electronic disclosures prior to acquisition if the consumer is able to bypass some or all of the \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) disclosures before choosing to accept the prepaid account. The Bureau agrees with the consumer group commenter that language in the proposed comment regarding whether or not the consumer could review unrelated information before reviewing the long form disclosure on a separate Web page potentially contradicted this general principle. Accordingly, the Bureau has removed that language from the commentary to the final rule.",
                        "In addition to the revisions discussed above, the Bureau is finalizing certain other minor changes to comments 18(b)(1)(i)-1 and -2 for clarity and consistency."

                "The proposal would have provided that the exclusion from the definition of finance charge in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(3) for overdraft services on checking accounts would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card. It also would have provided that the exclusion for participation fees in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(4) would not apply to credit accessed by a prepaid card.",
                "As discussed in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section, many industry commenters urged the Bureau to provide that the exception in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(3) applies to overdraft credit accessed in connection with prepaid accounts. One credit union service organization also indicated that the Bureau should provide that the exception in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(4) should apply to annual and other periodic fees to hold a credit plan in connection with a prepaid account.",
                "Several consumer group commenters stated that the exception in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(1) for application fees for credit features should not apply to credit accessed by prepaid cards. One consumer group commenter urged that the exceptions in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(2) for late fees, over the limit fees, and returned payment fees should not apply to credit accessed by prepaid cards. This commenter expressed concern that prepaid account issuers might use such fees as a back-end method of credit pricing, and stated that the Bureau should either include these fees in definition of \u201cfinance charge\u201d or make clear that they cannot be charged on prepaid accounts.",
                "As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is amending existing \u00a7\u20091026.4 and its commentary to provide that the exclusion in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(3) does not apply to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account and that the exclusion in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(4) does not apply to a fee to participate in a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.",
                "The Bureau has not adopted any changes to the exception in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(1) related to application fees, or to the exception in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(2) related to late fees, over the limit fees, returned check fees, and other fees for delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence. The Bureau believes these changes are outside the scope of the proposal and does not believe that these changes are warranted at this time. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether changes to these exceptions with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are needed."

                "The proposal would have required two distinct disclosures in the short form designed to alert consumers to other fees financial institutions may charge in addition to the standardized static fees disclosed at the top of the short form. First, following the static fee disclosures, pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8), the proposed short form would have disclosed up to three fees incurred most frequently by consumers of that particular prepaid card program that were not otherwise disclosed on the short form (referred to as incidence-based fees). Second, pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10), the short form would have included a statement in bold-faced type near the bottom of the disclosure stating: \u201cWe charge [X] other fees not listed here.\u201d As described further below, the Bureau believed that these two elements would help emphasize to consumers that the short form disclosure was not a comprehensive list of all fees, provide consumers with specific information about the additional fees that they were most likely to encounter, and encourage consumers to review the long form disclosure or otherwise seek additional information about the prepaid account's features and costs.",
                "As discussed further below in connection with both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), the Bureau is adopting both proposed disclosures with substantial revisions and is placing them together on the short form to provide greater clarity to consumers and enhance the impact of each disclosure relative to the proposed version. Other adjustments to the final rule to improve consumer comprehension and reduce implementation burdens for financial institutions include, for example, requiring disclosure of the number of additional types of fees charged in connection with the prepaid account program, rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total as proposed, and requiring disclosure of specific fee types on the short form based on revenue, rather than frequency, and only if in excess of a de minimis threshold. The Bureau believes that these and other changes will make the disclosures easier for financial institutions to prepare and more meaningful for consumers."

The number of fees would have been derived from those listed on the comprehensive long form disclosure pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), other than those listed in the short form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (8).",
                        "The Bureau sought comment on whether the proposed disclosure would be useful to consumers or whether listing the total number of additional fees without any other information would actually interfere with consumers' ability to make an informed choice between prepaid account programs. The Bureau acknowledged that there was some risk that consumers might assume that the additional fees were punitive, rather than covering the cost of optional services or product features that the consumer might find advantageous. However, the Bureau also noted that some participants in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing reported finding out about fees only after purchasing their card, and sometimes only after incurring them.\n          On balance, the Bureau believed that disclosing in the short form a statement indicating exactly how many additional fees could apply would encourage consumers to seek out more information about a prepaid account before acquisition.",
                        "Unlike the proposed incidence-based fees, the Bureau did not believe it was necessary to propose provisions about updating this statement regarding other fees. Pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(f), a financial institution would have been required to include the long form disclosure in a prepaid account's \u00a7\u20091005.7(b)(5) initial disclosures. Any updates made to the fees disclosed in the long form would have required an overhaul of all of the disclosures for a given prepaid account product, which the Bureau believed was unlikely to occur. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10)-1 would have provided examples of how to comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10)-2 would have provided guidance about how to count the total number of fees to disclose pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10). Specifically, the proposed comment would have clarified that, if the fee a financial institution imposes might vary, even if the variation is based on a consumer's choice of how to utilize a particular service, the financial institution must count each variation of the fee that might be imposed as a separate fee. The proposed comment also would have provided an example illustrating this concept. Finally, the proposed comment would have explained that, even if a fee could be waived under certain conditions, it would still be counted in order to comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10)."

                        "A number of industry commenters, including trade associations, issuing banks, and program managers, recommended eliminating the proposed disclosure of the number of additional fees charged. In its place, many of these commenters favored a general statement that other fees are charged, generally with reference to the cardholder agreement for more information about these other fees. One trade association and an issuing bank stated that they found the proposed disclosure rational and reasonable, as it provided useful data to consumers without overwhelming them with information and without overcrowding the short form disclosure, though they also preferred a requirement simply to state that additional fees could apply.",
                        "Many of these industry commenters expressed concern that presenting the number of fees would tend to mislead and confuse consumers and thus interfere with consumers' ability to make an informed choice among prepaid account programs. Several industry commenters said that the statement would mislead consumers into believing that these other fees are common fees they are likely to incur when in fact the commenters asserted that the fees may only be charged in connection with optional specialized services. Other industry commenters said that the number of other fees could mislead and confuse consumers into thinking that a product with a higher number of available functions\u2014and fees for those functions\u2014is more expensive or otherwise inferior to a product with fewer other fees, when in fact the opposite may be true. Some industry commenters warned that this stigmatized perception of a higher number of other fees and commensurate costs to update the disclosures may undermine innovation and flexibility, as financial institutions may either discontinue or cease developing new and flexible services that may be advantageous to consumers.",
                        "Similarly, one of the consumer groups that recommended disclosure of all fees in all acquisition settings noted that an account that has many more other fees may actually charge fewer fees for the services it has in common with another account, but the proposed short form would make it seem as though it was potentially a more costly product. The consumer group recommended that the Bureau monitor the effect of requiring only the listing of the number of \u201cother\u201d fees on market innovation and the cost and types of fees that are charged.",
                        "An issuing bank agreed that the disclosure of the number of additional fees charged can be a factor for consumers in comparing prepaid account terms, but also challenged the methodology of counting each fee variation as a separate fee. It said this methodology could be misleading to consumers as it will lead to an artificial overstatement of the total number of fees. It said that services like bill payment, which may have standard and expedited delivery and are designed to be flexible and offer the most choice and control to consumers, will make the product appear undesirable, as the number of additional fees will be inflated. Instead, it recommended counting fee types rather than individual fee variations within fee types. Two trade associations and two other issuing banks also recommended against counting each fee variation as a separate fee, agreeing that it might unnecessarily increase the number of other fees without commensurate benefit for consumers."

Second, instead of requiring disclosure of the number of additional fees, including all fee variations, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of the number of additional fee types.\n          \n            Third, instead of requiring the number of additional fees that could be imposed on a consumer in general, the Bureau is limiting this disclosure to the number of additional fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account. Fourth, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of an additional statement if a financial institution discloses additional fee types pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) that directs consumers to the disclosure of those additional fee types that follows. Fifth, the Bureau has relocated the statement regarding the number of additional fee types from the bottom portion of the proposed short form disclosure to a more clearly delineated \u201cadditional fee types\u201d portion that follows the static fees.",
                        "Finally, the Bureau is not adopting any of the proposed commentary, but rather is adopting new comments 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1 through -4 and 18(b)(2)(viii)(B)-1 to clarify various issues regarding application of the final rule."

Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) would have required disclosure of two fees for using an ATM to initiate a withdrawal of cash in the United States from a prepaid account, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution, using the term \u201cATM withdrawal fee\u201d or a substantially similar term, and \u201cin-network\u201d or \u201cout-of-network,\u201d or substantially similar terms. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed these ATM withdrawal fees on the top line of the short form.",
                        "The Bureau understood that the ATM fees for most prepaid accounts differ depending on whether the ATM is in a network of which the financial institution that issued the card is a member or an affiliate. Insofar as accessing ATM networks of which the issuing financial institution is not a member or an affiliate often costs the financial institution more, it typically charges a higher fee to a consumer for using that out-of-network ATM. Given that such potential variances are common, the Bureau believed that disclosure of fees for both in- and out-of-network ATMs withdrawals is important. Although the Bureau noted in the proposal that many participants during its pre-proposal consumer testing were unfamiliar with the difference between \u201cin-network\u201d and \u201cout-of-network\u201d ATMs, the Bureau believed the inclusion of these two fees on the top line of the proposed short form would highlight for consumers that such fee variations can occur and the importance of understanding the ATM network associated with a particular prepaid account program.",

In response to the Bureau's question regarding whether additional information is needed on the short form to explain the distinction between in-network versus out-of-network ATMs, a prepaid program manager, an issuing bank, and an industry trade association commented that it was unnecessary to require such an explanation, asserting that consumers generally understand the terminology and if not, consumers could direct their questions to the prepaid issuer or to the Bureau. The program manager also suggested permitting disclosure of a single ATM fee if the fees for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals are the same, as well as disclosing when ATM withdrawals are not available.",

The office of the State Attorney General said that its research revealed that ATMs were the most common way for payroll card accountholders in its State to access their wages and that accountholders regularly incurred fees for ATM transactions. It recommended that all payroll card account programs be required to provide free and unlimited withdrawal of wages via ATMs with no third-party fees. The trade association recommended permitting disclosure in the short form of the number of free ATM withdrawals available to payroll card accountholders.",

                        "No commenters objected to the inclusion of ATM withdrawal fees in the short form, or generally regarding distinguishing between in- and out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees."

The Bureau continues to believe it is important for consumers to know how much they will be charged to withdraw funds at an ATM and to know the difference, if any, for conducting the withdrawal at an in-network versus out-of-network ATM. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(3)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)(iii)-1, explaining that a financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an ATM to initiate a withdrawal of cash in a foreign country in the disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iii), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). In response to comments requesting that additional information be added to the disclosure of ATM withdrawal fees, the Bureau declines to require disclosure of such additional information in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iii). The Bureau believes the short form disclosure balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension. Moreover, much of the additional information recommended by commenters, such as third-party fees and the name and extent of the ATM network, must or may be provided in the long form disclosure. See, e.g., final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) and Sample Form A-10(f).",
                        "To address the comments recommending that the Bureau require more fulsome disclosure of the details regarding ATM fees for payroll card accounts (and similar comments made elsewhere recommending disclosure of other information in addition to ATM fees), the Bureau is finalizing new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), which permits inclusion of a statement in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts directing consumers to a location outside the short form for information on how to access funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. Final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii) contains a similar provision for government benefit accounts. To address the comment recommending disclosure of a single ATM fee if the fees for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals are the same (and similar comments made elsewhere regarding two-tier fee disclosures), the Bureau is finalizing new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii), which permits a single disclosure for like fees. Regarding the comment recommending disclosure of when ATM withdrawals are not available, both proposed and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2) require such disclosure through use of \u201cN/A\u201d as discussed above. See also final comment 18(b)(2)-1. Regarding the comment requesting that the Bureau ban fees for ATM transactions on payroll card accounts, such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking."

                "Similar to the proposed alternative for retail stores, the Bureau proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) to provide that before a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone, a financial institution would have to disclose orally the short form information that would have been required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i). Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) would have further stated that a financial institution could provide a written or electronic long form disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) after a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone if the financial institution communicated to a consumer orally, before a consumer acquired the prepaid account, that the information required to be disclosed by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) was available orally by telephone and on a Web site. The Bureau believed that as long as consumers were made aware of their ability to access the information contained in the long form disclosure, they would be able to get enough information to make an informed acquisition decision. Those who wished to learn more about the prepaid account could do so, and financial institutions would not be unduly burdened by having to provide the long form disclosure orally to all consumers who acquire prepaid accounts by telephone. A version of the long form disclosure, however, would have still been required to be provided after acquisition in the prepaid account's initial disclosures, pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(f).",
                "Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-1 would have explained that, for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii), a prepaid account was considered to have been acquired orally by telephone when a consumer spoke to a customer service agent or communicated with an automated system, such as an interactive voice response system, to provide personally identifiable payment information to acquire a prepaid account, but would have clarified that prepaid accounts acquired using a mobile device without speaking to a customer service agent or communicating with an automated system were not considered to have been acquired orally by telephone. The Bureau believed that, if a consumer used a smartphone to access a mobile application to acquire a prepaid account, and did not receive disclosures about the prepaid account orally, the disclosures could be provided electronically pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i)(B). The Bureau believed that in such a scenario the logistical challenges justifying an alternative timing requirement for accounts acquired orally by telephone were not present.",
                "Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have explained how disclosures provided orally could comply with the pre-acquisition timing requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i). Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have clarified that to comply with the pre-acquisition requirement set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) for prepaid accounts acquired orally by telephone, a financial institution may, for example, read the disclosures required under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) over the telephone after a consumer had initiated the purchase of a prepaid account by calling the financial institution, but before a consumer agreed to acquire the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have also explained that although the disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) was not required to be given pre-acquisition when a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone, a financial institution would still have to communicate to a consumer that the long form disclosure was available upon request, either orally by telephone or on a Web site. Finally, the proposed comment would have clarified that a financial institution must provide information on all fees in the terms and conditions as required by existing \u00a7\u20091005.7(b)(5), as modified by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(f), before the first EFT was made from a consumer's prepaid account.",
                "One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to provide consumers who acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically the option of receiving written disclosures by mail upon request. The Bureau notes that consumers acquiring prepaid accounts through these methods must still receive the initial disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7, which, as modified by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1), must include all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4). Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to separately provide consumers the right to request a written copy of information they are already required to receive under existing \u00a7\u20091005.7 and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1).",
                "The Bureau is therefore adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its related commentary largely as proposed, with a few minor revisions. Under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii), a financial institution is not required to provide the long form disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone if the following conditions are met: (A) The financial institution communicates to the consumer orally, before the consumer acquires the prepaid account, that the long form disclosure is available both by telephone and on a Web site; (B) the financial institution makes the long form disclosure available both by telephone and on a Web site; and (C) the long form disclosures are provided after the consumer acquires the prepaid account.",
                "The Bureau continues to believe that it is appropriate to modify the proposed general pre-acquisition disclosure requirements when a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone, and that requiring disclosure of only limited information by telephone will increase the likelihood that a consumer will understand any information about the prepaid account when acquiring it orally by telephone. The Bureau believes that, since the final rule mandates that consumers be made aware of their ability to access the information contained in the long form disclosure, consumers will have access to enough information to make an informed acquisition decision.",
                "As stated above, the Bureau is finalizing several modifications to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its commentary. First, the Bureau has added language to comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 to clarify that a financial institution can meet the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) by providing the required disclosures over the telephone using an interactive voice response or similar system. Second, for the same reason the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) above, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii)(C) to clarify that, to qualify for the telephone exception, the financial institution would have to provide the long form disclosure after the consumer acquires the prepaid account. Again, while this new provision does not set forth a specific time by which the long form disclosure must be provided after acquisition, the Bureau expects that compliance with \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii)(C) will typically be accomplished through delivery of the long form disclosure as part of the initial disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7, in accordance with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1). Finally, the Bureau has made certain other revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its commentary to streamline and clarify the language therein."

                "As explained at the beginning of the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, the proposal would have required two distinct disclosures in the short form designed to alert consumers to other fees financial institutions may charge in addition to the standardized static fees disclosed at the top of the short form. First, following the static fee disclosures, pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8), the proposed short form would have disclosed up to three fees incurred most frequently by consumers of that particular prepaid card program that were not otherwise disclosed on the short form (referred to as incidence-based fees). Second, pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10), the short form would have disclosed a statement in bold-faced type near the bottom of the disclosure stating: \u201cWe charge [X] other fees not listed here.\u201d As described herein, the Bureau believed that these two elements would help emphasize to consumers that the short form disclosure was not a comprehensive list of all fees, provide consumers with specific information about the additional fees that they were most likely to encounter, and encourage consumers to review the long form or otherwise seek additional information about the prepaid account's features and costs.",
                "As discussed in connection with both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), the Bureau is adopting both proposed disclosures with substantial revisions and is placing them together on the short form to provide greater clarity to consumers and enhance the impact of each disclosure relative to the proposed version. Other adjustments made to the final rule to improve consumer comprehension and reduce implementation burdens for financial institutions include, for example, requiring disclosure of the number of additional types of fees charged in connection with the prepaid account program, rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total as proposed and requiring disclosure of specific fee types on the short form based on revenue, rather than frequency, and only if in excess of a de minimis threshold. The Bureau believes that these and other changes will make the disclosures easier for financial institutions to prepare and more meaningful for consumers."

                        "In addition to the fees that all financial institutions would have had to disclose in the static portion of the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7), the Bureau also proposed that financial institutions disclose up to three additional \u201cincidence-based\u201d fees not already disclosed elsewhere on the short form that are incurred most frequently for that particular prepaid account product. If a financial institution offered several prepaid account products, the incidence-based fees analysis would have had to be conducted separately for each product, based on usage patterns in the prior 12-month period, and updated annually. Thus, the incidence-based fees that would have been disclosed to a consumer on the short form could have varied from one product to the next depending on which fees consumers incurred most frequently for each product.",
                        "The Bureau proposed this disclosure because it was concerned that, while the fee disclosures in the static portion of the short form under the proposed rule would have included the key fees on most prepaid accounts, that list is not comprehensive and there could be other fees that consumers might incur with some frequency. The Bureau also had concerns that, absent this incidence-based disclosure, there was a risk of evasion whereby a financial institution trying to gain an advantage relative to its competitors could restructure its fee schedule to make the fees disclosed in the static portion of the short form lower, while structuring its pricing to make up or even increase overall revenue by imposing fees that would not otherwise be disclosed on the short form. The Bureau believed that requiring financial institutions to disclose other fees that are frequently paid by consumers would limit the ability of financial institutions to avoid having to disclose relevant fee information up front on the short form disclosure.",
                        "Additionally, the Bureau believed that the incidence-based portion of the short form, though it would have mandated a specific metric to determine which additional fees may be listed, would have provided some flexibility to industry participants to disclose up to three more fees on the short form particular to each prepaid account product and that may be imposed for features that could be appealing to consumers.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I). Accordingly, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I) would generally have required disclosure of up to three fees, other than any of those fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7), that were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product.",
                        "For existing prepaid account products, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I) would have required that, at the same time each year, a financial institution assess whether the incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I) were the most frequently incurred fees in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product. In accordance with the timing requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h), a financial institution would have had to execute any updates required by the rules within 90 days for disclosures provided in written, electronic, or oral form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i). Disclosures provided on the packaging material of prepaid account access devices, for example, in retail stores pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), or in other locations, would have had to be revised when the financial institution printed new packaging material for its prepaid account access devices, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h). All disclosures provided pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I) and created after a financial institution makes an incidence-based fee assessment and determines changes are necessary would have had to include such changes, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h).",
                        "The Bureau believed that it was important for the incidence-based fee disclosure to list a prepaid account product's most commonly incurred fees. The Bureau, however, recognized that financial institutions would need time to update disclosures upon assessing whether any changes to the incidence-based fee disclosure are needed, although the Bureau expected such changes would be infrequent. The Bureau believed such updates would be easier for disclosures provided in electronic form or in written form outside of a retail setting. Thus, the Bureau proposed that financial institutions would have had to make updates to written, electronic, and oral disclosures within 90 days to ensure that consumers receive up-to-date incidence-based fee disclosures. The Bureau, however, recognized that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to market prepaid accounts in retail stores, and therefore proposed that financial institutions would have been able to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles. The Bureau acknowledged that the proposal could result in some disclosures for the same prepaid account product (i.e., electronic disclosures provided online or printed disclosures provided in person without the use of packaging) having different incidence-based fee disclosures on the short forms provided on retail store packaging material. The Bureau, however, did not believe that this discrepancy would significantly impact a consumer's decision regarding which prepaid account product to acquire since consumers would most likely be comparing the disclosures for two distinct products, and not reviewing disclosures side-by-side for the same prepaid account product found in different acquisition channels.",
                        "The Bureau also recognized that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with out-of-date incidence-based fee disclosure in retail stores could reduce the effectiveness of this disclosure. The Bureau, however, believed that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be overly burdensome.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed to adopt several comments to provide additional guidance on incidence-based fee disclosures. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)-1 would have provided guidance regarding the number of incidence-based fees to disclose in the short form, including when no fees, more than three, or less than three fees meet the criteria in the definition of incidence-based fees. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)-2 would have set forth how to determine which fees were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period and would have also clarified that the price for purchasing or activating a prepaid account could qualify as an incidence-based fee. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I)-3 would have provided guidance regarding the disclosure of incidence-based fees in accordance with the proposed effective date regime in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I)-4 would have explained how to disclose incidence-based fees when disclosing multiple service plans on a short form disclosure that would have been permitted by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I)-5 would have explained that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I) would have permitted a reprint exception that would not have required that financial institutions immediately destroy existing inventory in retail stores or elsewhere in the distribution channel, to the extent the disclosures on such packaging materials were otherwise accurate, but would have required that, if a financial institution determines that an incidence-based fee listed on a short form disclosure in a retail store no longer qualified as one of the most commonly incurred fees and made the appropriate change when printing new disclosures, any packages in retail stores that contained the previous incidence-based fee disclosure could still be sold in compliance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I).",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(II). Recognizing that new prepaid products have no prior fee data history, the Bureau also proposed additional requirements to address such circumstances. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(II) would have required that, if a particular prepaid account product was not offered by the financial institution during the prior 12-month period, the financial institution would have to disclose up to three fees other than any of those fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7) that it reasonably anticipates will be incurred by consumers most frequently during the next 12-month period. The incidence-based fee disclosures for newly-created prepaid account products would have to be included on all disclosures created for the prepaid account product, whether the disclosure is written, electronic, or on the packaging material of a prepaid account product sold in a retail store, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h). Although financial institutions do not have actual fee data for new prepaid account products, the Bureau believed that they nonetheless would have a reasonable expectation as to which fees would be incurred most frequently. Thus, financial institutions would have been required, for those prepaid account products without prior fee data, to estimate in advance the fees that should be disclosed in the incidence-based portion of the short form disclosure. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(II)-1 would have explained that the financial institution should use available data to reasonably anticipate what fees should be disclosed and provided an example to illustrate.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(8)(III). The Bureau also proposed additional requirements for when a particular prepaid account product's fee schedule changes. Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(III) would have required that, if a financial institution changes an existing prepaid account product's fee schedule at any point after assessing its incidence-based fee disclosure for the prior 12-month period pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I), it would have had to determine whether, after making such changes, it reasonably anticipates that the existing incidence-based fee disclosure would represent the most commonly incurred fees for the remainder of the current 12-month period. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the current incidence-based fee disclosure would not have represented the most commonly incurred fees for the remainder of the current 12-month period, it would have had to update the incidence-based fee disclosure within 90 days for disclosures provided in written or electronic form, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h).",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(III) also would have required that disclosures provided on a prepaid account product's packaging material, for example, in retail stores pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii), or in other locations, must be revised when the financial institution is printing new packaging material, in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h). All disclosures provided pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(III) and created after a financial institution makes an incidence-based fee assessment and determines changes are necessary must include such changes, in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(III)-1 would have provided an example demonstrating the impact of a fee change on an existing prepaid account product's incidence-based fee disclosure.",
                        "The Bureau noted in the proposal that its proposed model forms did not isolate or identify these incidence-based fees in a way that would have distinguished them from the other fees, outside the top-line, disclosed under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(5) through (7). Thus, the Bureau explained, a consumer comparing two different prepaid account products may see some types of fees that are the same (the seven standardized fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7)) and may see some that differ (the three incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)). During its pre-proposal consumer testing, the Bureau tested language identifying the incidence-based fees as such, but this language was often ignored or misunderstood by participants.\n          Nevertheless, the Bureau recognized that some variation on the short form fee disclosure could lead to confusion, and thus the Bureau sought comment on whether the model forms should more clearly indicate to a consumer the meaning of the incidence-based fees.",
                        "The Bureau also recognized that the proposed procedure for determining and disclosing incidence-based fees could be complicated in some instances, particularly for new prepaid accounts or those with revised fee schedules. Further, the Bureau acknowledged that basing the incidence-based fees determination on fee incidence might not make sense for all prepaid products. Thus, the Bureau sought comment on all aspects of this incidence-based fees proposal. Among other things, the Bureau specifically solicited feedback on whether other measures, such as fee revenue, would be better measures of the most important remaining fees to disclose to consumers considering a prepaid account, and whether there should be a de minimis threshold below which changes to the incidence ranking would not require form revisions, and if so, what that threshold should be."

                        "Numerous industry commenters spanning a panoply of interests in the prepaid industry including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, a law firm commenting on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, and other parties involved in the prepaid industry, as well as several employers, addressed the proposed requirement to disclose incidence-based fees, with the vast majority recommending the Bureau eliminate this aspect of the short form disclosure. Their specific concerns and criticisms are discussed in detail below. Industry commenters, however, generally supported the proposed reprint exception. That exception would have excused financial institutions from annually updating the incidence-based fees for disclosures provided on a prepaid account product's packaging material, for example, in retail stores, until the financial institution prints new packaging material.",
                        "Industry commenters offered myriad reasons in support of their recommendation that the Bureau not finalize the requirement to disclose incidence-based fees. Industry commenters' concerns, summarized here, are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs that follow. Some said that the disclosure would heavily burden industry with what they viewed to be little, if any, benefits to consumers and, if finalized as proposed, would likely cause some prepaid providers to exit the market. Many said that this disclosure defeats the uniformity in the short form and thus could inhibit consumers' ability to comparison shop. Many others asserted that the disclosure would create a discrepancy between fees disclosed online and those disclosed on packaging for financial institutions taking advantage of the reprint exception. Some industry commenters suggested that the incidence-based fees disclosed may not be germane to all consumers. Some also asserted the disclosure would be redundant because the incidence-based fees can be found elsewhere, such as on the long form disclosure.",
                        "Specifically, some industry commenters voiced concern regarding consumer comprehension of the significance of incidence-based fees. They said that the disclosure defeats uniformity within and comparison shopping among short form disclosures because incidence-based fees would vary among different prepaid account programs and over time even for the same program, which they contended would mislead consumers into thinking that absence of a certain fee on the short form may mean the feature is not offered. A few commenters said that because of differences in customer usage, some of the disclosed incidence-based fees would not be germane to some consumers. Some industry commenters contended that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing showed that consumers did not understand if they would incur incidence-based fees, that frequency of incidence determined disclosure of one feature over another, or how the information was relevant to them in selecting a prepaid account. One industry commenter said that addressing this confusion with an explanation of these topics in the short form disclosure would take up valuable space and create its own confusion, but that eliminating the requirement to disclose incidence-based fees would solve this problem while reducing the overwhelming amount and complexity of the information required in the short form disclosure.",
                        "Some industry commenters questioned the Bureau's rationale for the disclosure of incidence-based fees in the proposed rule, saying that the risk of fee evasion by industry is unwarranted in the current competitive prepaid marketplace.",
                        "Some industry commenters questioned the validity of the data upon which incidence-based fees would be calculated, saying incidence-based fees were unlikely to change significantly absent structural changes to the program and that, because prepaid accounts are typically short-lived, annual assessment would not provide a sufficient basis from which to extrapolate meaningful information.",
                        "Some industry commenters, including issuing banks, credit unions, and industry trade associations, asserted that requiring disclosure of incidence-based fees for products distributed in bank branch settings is unnecessary as availability of the long form disclosure prior to acquisition and bank personnel to answer questions both encourage more thoughtful consumer review. Some of these industry commenters claimed incidence-based disclosures would disproportionately burden community banks and credit unions because they use outside vendors to handle disclosures, creating higher costs and unfair due diligence demands on banks to oversee the vendors. Some said that, without an exemption for small issuers, compliance costs may force these providers out of the market. A program manager for government benefit account programs recommended an exemption for accounts arranged for or issued by government agencies, saying agencies usually each offer only one prepaid account program and consequently, consumers do not need disclosures to be provided in a format designed to facilitate comparison of multiple prepaid accounts offered by the agency. Alternatively, the commenter recommended permitting government agencies to aggregate their data for incidence-based fees rather than analyzing each program separately.",
                        "Many industry commenters focused on the perceived burden of this proposed requirement, saying the disclosure would be complex, costly, and difficult to implement. One industry commenter said the fear that any changes to incidence-based fees will require changes to packaging and marketing materials would stifle innovation and development of new services or new prepaid products. Another recommended the Bureau commission a study to confirm that the benefits of the incidence-based disclosure outweigh the burden. Many industry commenters said it would be a major undertaking to identify and calculate incidence-based fees, with some saying the proposed annual update alone would necessitate a massive amount of new procedures, controls, system updates, and packaging design changes.",
                        "Some questioned the meaning in the proposed rule of the term \u201cseparate prepaid account program,\u201d saying initial and ongoing identification and calculation of incidence-based fees would be particularly cost prohibitive for entities with hundreds or thousands of separate prepaid account programs, as they said is the case with certain companies that issue or manage payroll card account programs. Some commenters involved in payroll card account programs queried whether the proposed rule would require them to calculate incidence-based fees for each individual program negotiated separately with an employer or whether they could aggregate data across programs. For example, one payroll card account program manager with 4,000 individual employer programs said every annual printing would cost $1 per cardholder such that annual printing costs alone would be a multimillion dollar undertaking.",
                        "Some industry commenters questioned specific aspects of the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure. A few commenters questioned the proposed 90-day period for updates, saying it was unclear whether both assessing and updating incidence-based fees would be required in that time frame and recommended various extensions of the period, for example, to 120 days for both assessment and updating, 12 months after analysis to update, or within a reasonable time after a change. A trade association commenter said the requirement to disclose additional fee types would pose a \u201ccompliance trap\u201d because financial institutions could be second-guessed on how they categorized them.\n          Another industry commenter said financial institutions would have to justify their categorization and tracking of fees to examiners, even when vendors perform that service (as, they said, is the case with many small banks). Another commenter said the \u201creasonable\u201d standard for estimating incidence for new products would be complicated and inexact, with no guarantee of accuracy but would function as a de facto strict liability standard.",
                        "Many industry commenters responded to the Bureau's solicitation of comments regarding alternatives to the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure. They variously recommended the following in the short form disclosure: A general statement that other fees may apply, disclosing all fees, or adding to the static fees already disclosed on the short form up to three more common fees chosen by the financial institution or determined by the Bureau on the basis of research. Some industry commenters recommended modifying the proposed update schedule by requiring the update every two years, or requiring it only when there is a fee change which would require the financial institution to update the prepaid account terms, packaging, and disclosures in any case.",
                        "A few industry commenters addressed the Bureau's queries regarding whether the disclosure should be based on assessment of fee frequency, as proposed, or fee revenue. A trade association and an issuing bank said they had no preference, as long as the criteria are clear, easy to determine, and not subject to annual updating. A program manager also said it had no preference as it has the data necessary for either calculation, and the cost and compliance burden would be the same either way.",
                        "The proposal sought comment on a de minimis threshold below which changes to the incidence ranking would not require form revisions. While some industry commenters supported this idea, others went further and advocated for a general de minimis threshold that would not require disclosure of additional fee types below a threshold set by the Bureau. A trade association, a payment network, an issuing bank, and several program managers urged the Bureau to adopt a general de minimis exclusion from the incidence-based fee requirement. The issuing bank said this would help to ensure that consumers are provided with information on the short form disclosure that is most likely to be relevant to their actual use of the prepaid account. Other commenters explained that, in general, very little revenue is generated from fees paid by consumers that are not already reflected on the proposed short form, other than from the purchase price and activation fees (when charged), though there are outliers in certain circumstances. One commenter expressed concern that because so few consumers use the services associated with these other fees, the incidence-based fees required to be disclosed would likely change every year due to small shifts in consumer usage.",
                        "A trade association recommended the Bureau adopt a safe harbor to the proposed incidence-based fee requirement that allows financial institutions to disclose all fees on the short form, with a de minimis exception for fees that are imposed on fewer than 25 percent of accounts. A credit union similarly recommended that the Bureau give financial institutions the option of listing all fees on the short form, which it said would be more transparent to consumers and more beneficial particularly for issuers who charge a limited number of fees on their prepaid accounts.",
                        "Several consumer group commenters, on the other hand, supported the proposed disclosure of incidence-based fees. These commenters said that requiring disclosure of incidence-based fees would prevent financial institutions from designing their fee schedules to minimize fees required to be disclosed on the short form and to maximize those that are only listed on the long form disclosure, where consumers are less likely to see them. They also said the disclosure of incidence-based fees would help consumers evaluate and avoid the most-commonly charged fees.",
                        "The consumer group commenters also recommended some changes to the proposed requirement. They all recommended requiring calculation of the fees based on revenue, rather than frequency of incidence, saying it is more important to warn consumers about high fees that impact small numbers of consumers rather than small fees charged often. They warned that placing more importance on a commonly incurred but inexpensive fee, rather than a rare expensive fee, could result in consumers paying more for fees that are not prominently displayed. They said the rule could incent some providers to bring down cost of the most common fees in favor of higher fees on those incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges.",
                        "One consumer group commenter recommended eliminating the 12-month lookback period for assessment of incidence-based fees because an expensive fee, such as a legal process fee, may be charged sporadically but could devastate a consumer. That commenter also argued against a de minimis exception, saying any fee so small or so rarely incurred should be eliminated. Moreover, it said, a de minimis threshold would likely eliminate disclosure of infrequent but costly fees, such as legal fees for garnishment. The consumer group also suggested requiring standardized use of the term \u201cbill payment\u201d for incidence-based fees. Another consumer group recommended permitting a financial institution that charges a total of four other fees to disclose all four of those fees in lieu of disclosing three of those fees and the statement regarding other fees.",
                        "Regarding purchase price, one consumer group commenter agreed that, as the Bureau had proposed, the purchase price for a prepaid account should be a potential incidence-based fee and not be required as a static fee because of the limited space in the short form and other parts of the packaging can disclose this information. Moreover, the commenter said, it is a one-time fee and consumers will take notice of the price they have to pay for the prepaid account. On the other hand, another consumer group commenter recommended that the purchase price be required to be disclosed as a static fee on the short form or, alternatively, as an incidence-based fee. It said disclosure of this fee was important because almost half of regular GPR card users buy a new card when their funds are exhausted, so the purchase price is a frequent expense. Further, it stated that simply because the purchase price is deducted from the amount of cash loaded onto a prepaid card does not mean that consumers understand this fee."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), with substantial modifications, largely in response to comments received. First, as discussed above, the Bureau is moving the disclosure's location on the short form so that it appears immediately after the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). The Bureau believes that locating these disclosures together will help consumers see their connection and increase understanding of why the fee information specified under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) may vary among prepaid account programs, and thus enhance the use of short form disclosures for comparison shopping. The Bureau believes this will also make the disclosure of the total number of additional fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) more valuable to consumers by providing some additional specific information.",
                        "Second, the Bureau is finalizing several changes to the nature of the disclosure. In particular, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of two fee types\u2009\n          instead of three, and has renamed this requirement the \u201cdisclosure of additional fee types.\u201d In addition, the Bureau is requiring that the criteria for determining fee types be based on which categories generate the highest revenue from consumers, rather than highest incidence of consumer use as proposed. As discussed above, the Bureau compiled a list of fee type examples to provide guidance to financial institutions and to help facilitate their categorization of additional fee types for satisfying the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (ix).",
                        "Third, the Bureau has made a number of other adjustments intended to reduce compliance burden relative to the proposal regarding the tracking and reporting of the additional fee types. These adjustments are in addition to proposed burden-reducing measures that the Bureau is adopting in the final rule, such as the exemption from having to update the listing of additional fee types on previously printed packaging materials, pursuant to the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4). Additional burden-reducing measures in the final rule include a 24-month (rather than annual) cycle for assessing and updating the disclosures and permitting financial institutions to track revenue on a consolidated basis across multiple prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. The final rule also permits issuers not to provide disclosures for any fee categories that fall below 5 percent of consumer-generated revenues, as well as excluding certain other fee categories. Finally, the Bureau has replaced the proposed commentary with a number of new comments to provide additional clarification and guidance on the requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix).",
                        "The Bureau has considered the industry comments objecting to the proposed disclosure of incidence-based fees\u2009\n          and recommending their elimination from the final rule. It has also considered the alternatives recommended by some industry commenters and suggestions for improvement by consumer group commenters. The Bureau has made extensive refinements to the proposed framework based in substantial part on this feedback but continues to believe that there is value to maintaining a dynamic element on the short form and that disclosing specific additional fee information that is updated on a periodic basis is the best way to provide such dynamic information, as discussed further below.",
                        "As discussed in detail in the next few paragraphs, the Bureau continues to believe it is important that financial institutions disclose to consumers certain fee types not otherwise listed on the short form. The Bureau believes that this may be particularly important for certain virtual wallets and other products covered by this final rule that may have pricing structures that do not mirror those of GPR cards or other more traditional prepaid products, as well as for capturing potential major evolutions in pricing structures on traditional products that may occur in the future. Further, the final rule provides some flexibility to financial institutions that have fewer than two fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) to disclose additional fee types of their choice, such as those particular to their prepaid account program and imposed for features that could be appealing to consumers. It also provides additional flexibility for financial institutions to disclose the names and fee amounts of the discrete fee variations for additional fee types with two or fewer fee variations pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C).",
                        "First, as pointed out by some consumer group commenters, the requirement to disclose additional fee types in the short form disclosure creates a dynamic disclosure designed to reduce incentives for manipulating fee structures to reduce the cost of the most common fee types in favor of higher fees on fee types incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges. The Bureau is not convinced, as asserted by some industry commenters, that market forces alone would adequately control for potential fee manipulation. Requiring disclosure of additional fee types in the short form will help prevent financial institutions from minimizing the cost of the fees required to be disclosed in and outside the short form by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) in favor of higher fees for fee types that would only be required to be disclosed in the comprehensive long form disclosure, where the Bureau believes consumers are much less likely to see them before acquiring a prepaid account. In particular for prepaid accounts sold at retail, consumers may not see the additional fee types disclosed only in the long form and, thus, could be more likely to incur such fees unknowingly. Putting consumers on notice of additional fee types that, outside of those excluded from disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3), generate the highest revenue from consumers for the particular prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule will alert consumers to account features for which they may end up incurring a significant cost.",
                        "Second, eschewing full standardization in a static short form disclosure in favor of the dynamic disclosure of additional fee types enables the disclosure to capture market changes and innovations. In this way, the short form is capable of reflecting over time significant changes in consumer use patterns that affect the amount of revenue generated for new features. Disclosing additional fee types in the short form allows the disclosure to reflect the advent of new fee types that consumers may come to incur frequently and for significant cost that, without this requirement, otherwise would be prohibited from disclosure in the short form and thus could render it outdated and of diminished value to consumers over time. This same dynamism also permits disclosure of fees for certain types of prepaid accounts, such as mobile wallets, whose currently scant fee structures may not otherwise be represented in the short form. Further, requiring disclosure of additional fee types allows the short form to capture future fee types charged by new products and under new pricing models that emerge over time. Without this mechanism, the information provided to consumers in the short form disclosure may become ossified and anachronistic over time absent additional rulemakings by the Bureau to update the required elements of the short form.",
                        "The Bureau recognizes that there are some tradeoffs for consumers and for industry in providing the disclosures, but believes those disadvantages are outweighed by the benefits of these disclosures to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the changes it has made in the final rule address many of the concerns raised by industry commenters and also substantially reduce the burden on financial institutions related to providing these disclosures relative to the proposal.",
                        "One objection raised by industry commenters is that, because the additional fee types disclosures will be the only non-standardized elements of the short form, the lack of uniformity will cause consumer confusion and prevent comparison shopping. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, the Bureau had consumer tested language to explain how the incidence-based fees were selected for disclosure on the short form but found that the information did not track well with consumers. The Bureau believes that the final rule substantially reduces this problem by linking the disclosures in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) by using a transition statement between the two (\u201cHere are some of them:\u201d) as discussed above, making clear that the specific additional fee types listed are examples of additional types of fees not otherwise disclosed on the short form. While the short form will not specifically explain why those two particular fee types were selected for disclosure, consumers will be able to understand that this portion of the form is variable across prepaid account programs, evaluate the specific information provided for potential applicability to their expected prepaid account use, and seek more information. The Bureau does not believe it necessary for consumers to understand the calculations behind and the specific purpose of the additional fee types to benefit from their disclosure.",
                        "Some commenters said the proposed reprint exemption would create discrepancies among short form disclosures for the same prepaid account program depending on where a consumer views the form (for example, at retail versus online). However, in addition to the modifications to the final rule discussed above adding an explanatory heading above the listing of additional fee types, the Bureau believes it unlikely most consumers will be comparing short form disclosures for the same prepaid account program in different mediums. Moreover, a large majority of industry commenters favored the reprint exemption, as it reduces burden, and the Bureau believes it is preferable to retain this exemption in the final rule as opposed to removing it. The Bureau does not believe that the additional fee type disclosures required by the final rule will stifle innovation, as suggested by industry commenters, particularly given the reprint exemption and the additional explanation the Bureau has provided in the supplementary information for this final rule regarding use of change-in-terms notices pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) and notice of new EFT services pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7(c). See, e.g., the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) below.",
                        "With regard to comparison shopping, the Bureau believes that having the same disclosures in the bulk of the short form, including the static fees and informational statements, will create more than sufficient consistency to facilitate consumer comparison shopping based on key fees in the marketplace, despite some variance introduced by the disclosure of two additional fee types. At the same time, the disclosure of additional fee types will ensure that consumers are made aware of significant fee types relating to each particular prepaid account program. Also, the transition statement linking the statement regarding the number of additional fee types and the disclosure of additional fee types provides sufficient information to orient consumers to these disclosures and will help dispel the consumer confusion that concerned industry commenters, particularly in light of consumer testing of explanations of the criteria for selection of additional fee types that proved ineffective.",
                        "To preserve standardization and consistency across short form disclosures, the Bureau declines to exempt prepaid accounts distributed in branches, particularly those of community banks and credit unions, and by government agencies from the requirement to disclose additional fee types. In addition to preserving standardization across short form disclosures, the Bureau is concerned that creating an individualized disclosure regime for different acquisition settings would create a patchwork regulatory regime, which is what this rule seeks to eliminate. The Bureau believes it is important to make the short form disclosure as informative as possible considering its space constraints; the disclosures regarding additional fee types will encourage consumers to review the long form for more detailed information in a way that simply providing the long form disclosure will not do.",
                        "In finalizing this provision, the Bureau attempted to maximize the usefulness of the disclosure for consumers while exacting the minimum burden on industry. As discussed above and below, the final rule incorporates many burden-reducing measures relative to the proposal, such as excluding certain fees from potential disclosure as additional fee types altogether (final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) and (3)), allowing for a consolidated calculation of additional fee types to occur across all prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule (final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)), increasing the timeframe for data collection and assessment/update from one year to 24 months (final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E)), and incorporating a de minimis revenue threshold to exclude from potential disclosure fee types that fall below this threshold (final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2)). The Bureau is skeptical that this disclosure requirement will prompt financial institutions to exit the prepaid market as suggested by some commenters. Rather, the Bureau believes that the burden imposed on financial institutions by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) is manageable. Also, with regard to comments that the disclosure of additional fee types in the short form is redundant of information found in the long form disclosure, the Bureau believes these fees merit disclosure in the short form as it is the disclosure most likely to be reviewed pre-acquisition by consumers.",
                        "Each aspect of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) is addressed in turn below, together with other specific comments from both industry and consumer groups."

The requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) would have been in addition to the initial disclosure requirements in existing \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) and corresponded to the requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) for prepaid accounts generally.\n          EFTA section 905(a) sets forth disclosure requirements for accounts subject to the Act.\n          In addition to these disclosures, the Bureau proposed to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act to require government agencies to provide disclosures prior to the time a consumer acquires a government benefit account. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) below for prepaid accounts, the Bureau believed that adjustment of the timing requirement was necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of government benefit account consumers, because the proposed revision would have assisted consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their government benefit accounts.",

Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1) would have stated that before a consumer acquired a government benefit account, a government agency must comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b), in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h).",

As it noted in the proposal, the Bureau believed it was important for consumers to realize they had the option of not accepting a government benefit account before they acquired the account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form would help to ensure consumers were aware of this right. To that end, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2) would have stated that before a consumer acquired a government benefit account, the agency must provide a statement pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) that the consumer did not have to accept the government benefit account and that the consumer could ask about other ways to get their benefit payments from the agency instead of receiving them through the account, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(a).",
                        "Proposed comment 15(c)-1 would have explained that proposed Model Form A-10(a) contained a model form for the pre-acquisition short form disclosure requirements for government benefit accounts pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c), and that government agencies could use Sample Form A-10(e) to comply with the pre-acquisition long form disclosure requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1). Proposed comment 15(c)-2 would have reiterated that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) generally required delivery of both the short form and long form disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account, and provided, in comment 15(c)-2.i, an example illustrating when a consumer received disclosures before acquisition of an account for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1). Proposed comment 15(c)-3 would have explained that the disclosures and notice required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1) and (2) could be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer acquired or agreed to acquire a government benefit account. When a consumer received benefits eligibility information and signed up or enrolled to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gave the disclosures and notice required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1) and (2) before issuing a government benefit account would have complied with the timing requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)."

                        "Several industry and government commenters objected to the wholesale application of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures to government benefit accounts. Specifically, several trade associations, a program manager for government benefit accounts, and two State government agencies urged the Bureau to exempt government benefit accounts from the proposed disclosure regime altogether, or to exempt them from the requirement to provide the short form disclosure. These commenters argued that the timing requirements proposed by the Bureau were too difficult to implement and unnecessary, since consumers could not in fact shop for alternative government benefit cards. One State government agency commenter argued that the application of the proposal to its program could necessitate revisions to its vendor contracts. In addition, commenters argued that most of the information that would be required by the proposed disclosures is already disclosed to consumers of government benefit accounts in the initial disclosures required by existing \u00a7\u20091005.7(b)(5) or would be disclosed via the proposed long form disclosure. Receiving duplicative information in the short form and long form disclosures, these commenters asserted, would lead to consumer confusion and information overload.",
                        "Other industry and government commenters did not object to the general application of the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements to government benefit accounts, but urged the Bureau to modify the requirements to better suit the government benefit account context. For example, several industry trade associations, a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, a program manager for government benefit card programs, and State government agencies argued that consumers would be confused if they saw certain fees listed on the government benefit account disclosures that did not in fact apply to their government benefit account program. These commenters urged the Bureau to allow agencies and financial institutions to omit such fees rather than disclose them with a corresponding \u201cN/A\u201d or \u201c$0,\u201d as required under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) and comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1. Likewise, certain commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the disclosures for government benefit account programs disclose the maximum amount that could be charged for each fee, since such a disclosure would in some cases misinform consumers as to the actual fee charged in connection with their account.",
                        "The program manager commenter and a State government agency commenter argued that government benefit accounts should be exempt from the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure requirements. They argued that the calculation required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8) would be too difficult to complete for government benefit accounts, especially since it was unclear whether the calculation must include every distinct program the issuer offers (of which there could be dozens), or only different types of programs. Oftentimes, the commenters noted, issuers offer only one type of program, but that program is customized for individual government agency clients. The commenters argued in addition that government benefit accounts should be exempted from the segregation requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4), so that the short form disclosure accompanying them can include additional information about how consumers can use their accounts with minimal fee charges.",
                        "A large number of commenters, including payment networks, issuing banks, program managers, industry trade associations, a member of Congress, and several government agencies, urged the Bureau to revise the language of the notice requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2) to inform a consumer that he or she was not required to accept the government benefit account. They argued that the proposed language was overly negative in tone and would dissuade consumers from choosing prepaid accounts by giving them the impression that prepaid products were unsafe or less preferable than other payment options. A program manager for government benefit accounts and a State government agency also urged the Bureau to remove the requirement that the banner notice for government benefit accounts include a sentence encouraging consumers to \u201cask about other ways to get\u201d their payments. These commenters argued that this language would lead consumers to contact the government agency or their individual caseworkers to get information about the prepaid account program. Such outreach by consumers would place a further burden on already strained resources without aiding consumers, since agencies or caseworkers were unlikely to have the information the consumer is seeking. Consumer group commenters also asked the Bureau to revise the notice language to include information about what alternative payment methods the consumer could choose, arguing that the onus should not be on the consumer to seek out information about what other payment options are available.",
                        "The Bureau also received numerous comments, from both industry and consumer groups, regarding the timing requirements of the pre-acquisition disclosures and their application in the government benefit context. As stated above, the Bureau proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 to clarify when a consumer enrolling to receive government benefits via a prepaid account received the disclosures in compliance with the timing requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i). An industry trade association, two issuing banks, a program manager for government benefit accounts, and a State government agency, argued that the proposed comments did not provide sufficient clarity. Specifically, they were concerned that proposed comment 15(c)-2.i suggested that \u201cacquisition\u201d in the government benefit context meant the consumer's physical acquisition of the card. According to these commenters, entities charged with administering government benefit account programs often distribute inactive government benefit cards to consumers at the same time as they distribute accompanying disclosures and other paperwork. The commenters were concerned that, as proposed, the commentary would disrupt current practices and place additional implementation burdens on government agencies. Further, they argued that the practice of providing consumers with an inactive card does not harm consumers, since consumers do not accrue any fees or undertake any obligations until the card is activated. Instead, the industry and government commenters urged the Bureau to clarify in revised commentary that acquisition for purposes of government benefit accounts was the point at which the consumer agreed or elected to be paid via a government benefit card. One trade association argued instead that the Bureau should define acquisition in this context as the point at which the consumer activates the government benefit account.",
                        "Several consumer group commenters agreed that the Bureau should provide greater clarity regarding what it meant to \u201cacquire\u201d a government benefit account, but argued that the point of acquisition should be defined as earlier in the enrollment process. Two consumer groups specified further that the disclosures should be provided before the consumer acquired the physical (if un-activated) card.",
                        "Finally, an industry trade association and an issuing bank argued that the Bureau should exempt government benefit accounts from the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(12) that the short form disclosure include a statement communicating to the consumer that a prepaid account must register with a financial institution or service provider in order for the funds loaded onto it to be protected. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believed this disclosure was necessary because many consumer protections set forth in the proposal would not have taken effect until the consumer registered the account. The Bureau acknowledged, however, that the disclosure would be less useful for government benefit account recipients, since consumers have to register with the agency in any event in order to receive their benefits. Commenters noted in addition that the notice was not necessary for government benefit accounts because, as discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) below, government agencies are required to provide error resolution and limited liability protections to government benefit account consumers regardless of whether those consumers have registered their accounts."

The Bureau is finalizing this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that extending the disclosure requirements in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of government benefit account consumers, by assisting consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their government benefit accounts.",
                        "Largely similar to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.15(c), final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(1) states that before a consumer acquires a government benefit account, a government agency shall comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b). As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i) and (ii), which largely mirror final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(xiv)(A) and (B). Section 1005.15(c)(2)(i) reflects several changes to the proposed requirement to inform consumers that they are not required to accept the government benefit account, while \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii) provides that agencies may include additional information about how consumers can access their government benefit account funds or balance information for free or for a reduced fee. The Bureau is also adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(3) to address the form of the pre-acquisition disclosures required for government benefit accounts pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c). Second, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed comment 15(c)-1; accordingly, it has renumbered proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 as final comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively. Third, the Bureau is adopting new comment 15(c)-3. Finally, the Bureau is finalizing certain revisions to those comments to provide further guidance on when a consumer acquires a government benefit account for purposes of the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements.",
                        "Although the Bureau understands that government benefit accounts are distinguishable from other prepaid accounts in several material respects, including the way they are distributed and marketed and the fees associated with them, the Bureau declines to exempt government benefit accounts from the general requirement to provide both a short form and long form disclosure before the consumer acquires the account. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) and as discussed in the section-by-section analysis thereof, agencies are not required to pull and replace prepaid account packaging materials with non-compliant disclosures that were produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe that consumers who use these accounts will benefit from the ability to review a set of uniform disclosures regarding their accounts. First, the disclosures provide a clear and conspicuous disclosure of consumers' right under \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) to receive their payment in some other form. The Bureau believes that this important disclosure may be less conspicuous, and therefore potentially less effective, if it were disclosed on the long form disclosure, since the long form disclosure contains far more information in a format that is less hierarchical than the short form disclosure. Second, the new disclosures highlight information that, according to the Bureau's consumer testing, was the most important information consumers needed to inform their decision-making with respect to their preferred payment method.\n          Third, although consumers may not be able to shop for alternative government benefit cards, the short form disclosure facilitates comparison shopping between the government benefit card and, for example, the consumer's own prepaid card or a prepaid card sold at retail. With respect to the comments that the pre-acquisition timing requirements would be particularly difficult to implement in the government benefit context, the Bureau notes that the revisions it is making to proposed comment 15(c)-2 (re-numbered as comment 15(c)-1) in the final rule, as discussed below, will provide government agencies and financial institutions with more flexibility to design efficient and practical enrollment procedures that comply with \u00a7\u20091005.15(c).",
                        "The Bureau likewise disagrees with industry commenters' suggestion that the statement regarding benefit payment options is negative and implies that government benefit accounts are inferior products, thereby discouraging consumers from using them. As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv) below, the Bureau examined this issue in its post-proposal consumer testing and found that participants did not construe the language negatively, confirming the Bureau's original understanding from the proposal.\n          Nonetheless, the Bureau has decided to include in the final rule an alternative version of the statement language which the Bureau believes would address commenters' concerns. Moreover, unlike the proposed statement, this added alternative has the advantage of providing concrete options to consumers regarding other ways to receive their funds. The Bureau is thus finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i), which mirrors final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), and provides that as part of its short form pre-acquisition disclosures, the agency must provide a statement that the consumer does not have to accept the government benefit account and directing the consumer to ask about other ways to receive their benefit payments from the agency instead of receiving them via the account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cYou do not have to accept this benefits card. Ask about other ways to receive your benefits.\u201d Alternatively, an agency may provide a statement that the consumer has several options to receive benefit payments, followed by a list of the options available to the consumer, and directing the consumer to indicate which option the consumer chooses using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: \u201cYou have several options to receive your payments: [list of options available to the consumer]; or this benefits card. Tell the benefits office which option you choose.\u201d Final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i) also provides that this statement must be located above the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv). This statement must appear in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the fee headings required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv).",
                        "To address comments arguing that agencies should be permitted to include additional information on the short form disclosure for government benefit accounts about how consumers can use their accounts with minimal fee charges, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii), which states that an agency may, but is not required to, include a statement in one additional line of text in the short form disclosure directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access government benefit account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. This statement must be located directly below any statements disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), or, if no such statements are disclosed, above the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x). This statement must appear in the same type size used to disclose variable fee information pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), or, if none, the same type size used for the information required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii).",
                        "To provide greater clarity and additional guidance on the specific form and formatting requirements that must apply to government benefit account disclosures, the Bureau is moving the reference to Model Form A-10(a) to new \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(3). New \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(3) mirrors several form and formatting requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b). Specifically, it states that when a short form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) is provided in writing or electronically, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) shall be provided in the form of a table. Except as provided in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B), the short form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2) shall be provided in a form substantially similar to final Model Form A-10(a). Final Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) when the agency does not offer multiple service plans.",
                        "Because the Bureau has added format requirements for government benefit account disclosures in new \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(3), proposed comment 15(c)-1 is now superfluous; accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing that comment. The Bureau has therefore renumbered proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 as final comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively.",
                        "With respect to comments regarding the timing of acquisition requirements in \u00a7\u20091005.15(c), the Bureau agrees that the final rule should provide greater clarity with respect to when a consumer acquires a government benefit account. The Bureau believes that, in providing such clarity, the rule should strike a balance between avoiding significant disruption of current benefit enrollment practices and ensuring that consumers receive the new disclosures early enough in the enrollment process to inform their decision of how to receive their payments, thereby furthering the goals of the compulsory use provision in \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2). Accordingly, the Bureau declines to define acquisition as, for example, the point at which the consumer obtains physical possession of a government benefit card, or the point at which a consumer signs an enrollment form, because such a rule could be overly prescriptive and could disrupt current practices and delay benefit disbursement. On the other hand, the Bureau also declines to define acquisition as the point at which a consumer receives his or her first payment on the government benefit card, because it believes that by the time a consumer receives funds via a particular payment method, he or she is less likely to consider alternative options for how to get paid, thereby reducing the value of the pre-acquisition disclosures. Furthermore, the Bureau notes that, pursuant to the compulsory use prohibition in \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2), discussed above, consumers cannot be required to receive government benefits by direct deposit to any particular institutions, including a specific prepaid account. In other words, consumers who have the option to receive their government benefits via a government benefit account must be provided with at least one alternative payment method. The Bureau believes that, particularly in such scenarios, the proposed disclosures should be provided in time to help a consumer decide between the alternative payment methods available to him or her.",
                        "Accordingly, and in consideration of the comments above, the Bureau is finalizing revisions to proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 (re-numbered as comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively) to clarify that a consumer acquires a government benefit account when he or she chooses to receive benefits via the government benefit account. Specifically, final comment 15(c)-1 has been revised to state that, for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c), a consumer is deemed to have received the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) prior to acquisition when the consumer receives the disclosures before choosing to receive benefits via the government benefit account. The Bureau recognizes that consumers may indicate their choice to be paid via a government benefit card in various ways, including, for example, by signing or filling out an enrollment form or by calling the financial institution to activate the card. The final rule does not specify what actions manifest a consumer's choice regarding how to get paid.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing the first example in comment 15(c)-1.i generally as proposed. The second example in final comment 15(c)-1.i (which as proposed would have stated that the short form and long form disclosures are provided post-acquisition if a consumer receives them after receiving the government benefit card) has been revised to state that if the consumer does not receive the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) to review until the time at which the consumer received the first benefit payment deposited into the government benefit account, these disclosures were provided to the consumer post-acquisition, and were not provided in compliance with final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c). Under the final rule, therefore, a government agency can provide the short form and long form disclosures in the same package as the physical prepaid card and still comply with the requirement in final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) that the forms be provided prior to acquisition. Likewise, a government agency can provide the pre-acquisition disclosures at the same appointment during which the consumer acquires the government benefit account so long as the disclosures are provided before the consumer actually chooses to receive payments via the account.",
                        "Final comment 15(c)-2 also reflects certain other technical revisions for clarity and consistency with the above changes. Specifically, this comment states that the disclosures and notice required by final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) may be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer receives a government benefit card. When a consumer receives benefits eligibility information and enrolls to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gives the disclosures and notice required by final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) before the consumer chooses to receive the first benefit payment on the card complies with the timing requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c).",
                        "The Bureau has added new comment 15(c)-3 to provide clarification regarding the form and formatting requirements for government benefit account disclosures. This comment explains that the requirements in \u00a7\u20091005.15(c) correspond to those for payroll card accounts set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b). The comment also cross-references final comments 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 and 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1 for additional guidance regarding the requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively. The Bureau has also added new comment 15(c)-4 to clarify the application of the requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) that the name of the financial institution be disclosed outside the short form disclosure for government benefit accounts. Pursuant to new comment 15(c)-4, the financial institution whose name must be disclosed pursuant to the requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) is the financial institution that directly holds the account or issues the account's access device. Also pursuant to comment 15(c)-4, the disclosure provided outside the short form may, but is not required to, include the name of the government agency that established the government benefit account.",
                        "Finally, the Bureau agrees with commenters that the notice regarding registration of the prepaid account that would have been required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(12) is likely not necessary for government benefit accounts, as the registration process is typically completed before the account is opened. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) below, the final rule does not require the statement regarding registration where customer identification and verification occurs for all prepaid accounts within the prepaid program before the account is opened."

Cash reloads are one of the primary ways for a consumer to add funds to a prepaid account. As such, the Bureau believed that the existence of a cash reload service and the fee for using such a service, if any, is important for consumers to know insofar as this is a key feature of many prepaid accounts. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed the cash reload fee on the top line of the short form disclosure.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed to adopt comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(4)-1, which would have provided guidance on what would be considered a cash reload fee. Specifically, the proposed comment explained that the cash reload fee, for example, would include the cost of adding cash at a point-of-sale terminal, the cost of purchasing an additional card or other device on which cash is loaded and then transferred into a prepaid account, or any other method a consumer may use to load cash into a prepaid account. This proposed comment would have also clarified that if a financial institution offers more than one method for a consumer to load cash into the prepaid account, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have required that it only disclose the highest fee on the short form. The Bureau noted that consumers may incur additional third-party fees when loading cash onto a card or other access device; these expenses are typically not controlled by the financial institution or program manager and instead are charged by the entity selling the cash reload product. Such fees would not be disclosed on the proposed short form pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-2. The Bureau noted, however, that, pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-3, fees imposed by third parties acting as an agent of the financial institution would always have to be disclosed in the long form.",
                        "As described in the proposal, the Bureau considered requiring financial institutions to list on the short form disclosure both cash reload methods discussed in proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(4)-1: Loads via a point-of-sale terminal and loads via an additional card or other device. The Bureau, however, believed it was important to limit the amount of information on the short form disclosure to maintain its simplicity in order to facilitate consumer understanding of the information that is included. Further, in its pre-proposal consumer testing, the Bureau found that participants consistently understood a disclosure containing a single cash reload fee, and therefore the Bureau did not believe it was as important to include two fees for this fee type."

                        "One issuing bank and a number of consumer groups expressed concern that failing to reflect third-party fees in connection with the proposed disclosure of the cash reload fee in the short form might create consumer confusion given that it is a standard industry practice for reload network providers or third-party retailers, not the financial institutions that issue prepaid accounts, to provide and charge for the reloading of cash into prepaid accounts. In such circumstances, due to the prohibition on inclusion of third-party fees in the short form pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C), a financial institution that does not offer proprietary cash reloading capabilities would typically disclose the cash reload fee as \u201c$0,\u201d while a financial institution that offers proprietary cash reloading capabilities would have to disclose the cost for the cash reload. In addition to confusing consumers, commenters suggested this outcome would result in a competitive disadvantage for financial institutions that offer proprietary systems, which are usually less expensive than third-party systems, and thereby dissuade financial institutions from offering this service. A trade association recommended eliminating the term \u201ccash reload\u201d fee in favor of \u201cdeposit\u201d fee for consistency and clarity. An issuing bank recommended disclosure of a range of fees for cash reloads and a statement explaining where to find reload locations as well as allowing disclosure of the conditions under which the cash reload fee could be waived instead of the asterisk and linked statement for variable fees pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(C). A program manager commenter recommended permitting disclosure of a disclaimer for third-party charges for cash reloads. An office of a State Attorney General recommended prohibiting cash reload fees, particularly for payroll card accounts, but otherwise supported the disclosure."

As in the proposal, the Bureau is requiring in the final rule disclosure of the cash reload fee in the top line of the short form because it is one of the primary ways consumers fund their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes the disclosure in the short form of a single cash reload fee balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and therefore declines to require disclosure of additional content in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iv) as requested by commenters.",

See also final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iv) and (v). The Bureau had intended the proposed rule to require disclosure of the complete cost of reloading cash. While the Bureau believes that a general prohibition on the disclosure of third-party fees in the short form is appropriate, the Bureau also believes that it is important to reflect the cost of a cash reload via a non-proprietary cash reload network and to avoid disfavoring particular prepaid market participants in connection with reload systems, which is a concern raised by several commenters. By requiring inclusion of the full cost of cash reloads, including third-party fees, consumers will receive full information about the amount of this key fee as well as ensuring standardized disclosure requirements among market participants. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iv) also reflects minor technical modifications for clarity.",

Final comment 18(b)(2)(iv)-2 thus allows a financial institution that does not permit cash reloads via a third-party reload network but instead permits cash deposits, for example, in a bank branch, to use the term \u201ccash deposit\u201d instead of \u201ccash reload.\u201d Regarding the comment requesting that the Bureau ban fees for cash reloads, such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.",

While such accounts are currently defined only in existing \u00a7\u20091005.15(a)(2), the Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that given the other modifications to Regulation E proposed therein, it was appropriate to explicitly add such accounts used for the distribution of government benefits as a stand-alone sub-definition of prepaid account as well. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to have \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(iii) state that the term prepaid account includes a government benefit account, as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.15(a)(2).",

Under existing \u00a7\u20091005.17, financial institutions must provide consumers with a notice describing the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent, before fees or charges may be assessed on the consumer's account for paying such overdrafts.",
                        "Existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a) currently defines \u201coverdraft service\u201d to mean a service under which a financial institution assesses a fee or charge on a consumer's account held by the institution for paying a transaction (including a check or other item) when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the account. Existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a) also provides that the term \u201coverdraft service\u201d does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to: (1) A line of credit subject to Regulation Z, including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, or overdraft line of credit; (2) a service that transfers funds from another account held individually or jointly by a consumer, such as a savings account; or (3) a line of credit or other transaction exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.3(d). In adopting the provisions in what is now existing \u00a7\u20091005.17, the Board indicated that these methods of covering overdrafts were excluded because they require the express agreement of the consumer.",
                        "As discussed in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section, in the proposal, the Bureau declined to extend the current regulatory scheme governing overdraft services on checking accounts to prepaid accounts, and instead proposed to regulate these types of services generally under Regulation Z (as well as Regulation E's compulsory use provision). The proposal would have amended existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(1) to explain that the term \u201coverdraft service\u201d does not include credit plans that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, the proposal would have amended existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(1) to provide that the term \u201coverdraft service\u201d does not include any payments of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or credit plan subject to Regulation Z, including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, overdraft line of credit, or a credit plan that is accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z. Similar to the other exemptions from the definition of \u201coverdraft service,\u201d under proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(a)(1) and proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7, credit card plans in connection with prepaid accounts would have required the express agreement of consumers in that, under the proposal, such plans could be added to previously issued prepaid accounts only upon a consumer's application or request. In addition, under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(g)(1) and proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h), a credit card account could not have been added to a previously issued prepaid account until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered.",
                        "In the proposal, the Bureau also noted that the opt-in provision in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17 would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card that would not have been a credit card under the proposal because the card could have only accessed credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Specifically, existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a) applies only to overdraft services where a financial institution assessed a fee or charge for the overdraft. For prepaid accounts under the proposal, any fees or charges for ATM or one-time \u201cdebit card\u201d transactions (as that term is used in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17) that access an institution's overdraft service would have been considered \u201cfinance charges\u201d under the proposal. Thus, under the proposal, a prepaid card that is not a credit card could not be charging any fees or charges for ATM or one-time \u201cdebit card\u201d transactions (as that term is used in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17) for accessing the overdraft service, such that the opt-in provision in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17 would apply. Under the proposal, if a prepaid card were charging any fees or charges for ATM or one-time \u201cdebit card\u201d transactions (as that term is used in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17) that accessed the overdraft service, the prepaid card would have been a credit card under Regulation Z. In that case, the prepaid card would not have been subject to the opt-in requirement in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17, but would be subject to provisions of Regulation Z, as discussed above."

As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)).

As discussed above, in the proposal, the Bureau also noted that the opt-in provision in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17 would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card that would not have been a credit card under the proposal because the card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                        "Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is adding new \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(4) to provide that the term \u201coverdraft service\u201d does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). As discussed above, a prepaid card would not be a hybrid prepaid-card when it accesses this credit. With respect to such an overdraft credit that meets the conditions for the exception in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer could still qualify for this exemption if the issuer is charging a per transaction fee for paying a transaction on the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the per transaction fee is not higher based on whether the transaction only accesses asset funds in the prepaid account or also accesses credit. For example, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each paid transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including transactions that only access asset funds, transactions that take the account balance negative, and transactions that occur when the account balance is already negative. A prepaid account issuer could still qualify for the exception under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) even if it was charging this $1.50 transaction fee, so long as the prepaid account issuer meets the conditions of new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4).",

This is true even though the prepaid account issuer may be charging a per transaction fee as described above on the prepaid account, including for transactions that access incidental credit as described above. The Bureau believes that the opt-in requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.17 are not necessary for this types of overdraft credit given that the per transaction fee is the same amount regardless of whether the transaction is only accessing funds in the prepaid account or is also accessing credit.",
                        "The Bureau notes that a prepaid account issuer does not satisfy the exception in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) from the definition of \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d if it charges on a prepaid account transaction fees for credit extensions on the prepaid account where the amount of the fee is higher based on whether the transaction accesses asset funds in the prepaid account or accesses credit. For example, assume a $15 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account each time a transaction is authorized or paid when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account at the time of the authorization or settlement. Also assume, a $1.50 fee is imposed each time a transaction on the prepaid account only accesses funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account. The $15 charge would disqualify the prepaid account issuer for the exception under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) and the prepaid card would be a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to that prepaid account. In that case, the prepaid account issuer still would not be subject to final \u00a7\u20091005.17, but would be subject to Regulation Z. In that case, under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(b), the credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card must be structured as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d as discussed above.",
                        "While overdraft credit described in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) is exempt from final \u00a7\u20091005.17, this incidental credit generally is covered under Regulation E. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.12(a) above, Regulation E's provisions in final \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.11 and 1005.18(e) regarding error resolution would apply to extensions of this credit. In addition, such credit extensions would be disclosed on Regulation E periodic statements under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) or, if the financial institution follows the periodic statement alternative in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1), on the electronic and written histories of the consumer's prepaid account transactions. This overdraft credit, however, is exempt from the compulsory use provision in final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) above.",
                        "Non-covered separate credit features that are functioning as an overdraft credit features with respect to prepaid accounts also typically will not be subject to final \u00a7\u20091005.17 because these credit features typically will be lines of credit that are subject to Regulation Z, which are expressly exempt from the definition of \u201coverdraft service\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(1)."

This portion of the proposed definition expanded upon the phrase \u201cissued on a prepaid basis\u201d used in the Gift Card Rule's definition of general-use prepaid card in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(3),\n          by also including a prepaid product that was \u201cnot issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter.\u201d",

The Bureau proposed this approach to address concerns that prepaid providers could restructure existing products to avoid coverage by the proposed rule if they were to separate account acquisition from initial funding. In addition, the Bureau believed the proposed provision would have ensured that consumers who used prepaid accounts received the protections in the proposed rule\u2014particularly the pre-acquisition disclosures regarding fees and other key terms\u2014prior to and upon establishment of the account.",
                        "Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-3 would have clarified that to be \u201cissued on a prepaid basis,\u201d a prepaid account had to be loaded with funds when it was first provided to the consumer for use. For example, if a consumer purchased a prepaid account and provided funds that were loaded onto a card at the time of purchase, the prepaid account would have been issued on a prepaid basis. A prepaid account offered for sale in a retail store would not have been issued on a prepaid basis until it was purchased by the consumer.",
                        "Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-4 would have explained that a prepaid account that was not issued on a prepaid basis but was capable of being loaded with funds thereafter included a prepaid card issued to a consumer with a zero balance to which funds could be loaded by the consumer or a third party subsequent to issuance. This would not have included a product that could never store funds, such as a digital wallet that only held payment credentials for other accounts.",
                        "Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-5 would have clarified that to satisfy proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(A), a prepaid account would have to either be issued on a prepaid basis or be capable of being loaded with funds. This would have meant that the prepaid account had to be capable of holding funds, rather than merely acting as a pass-through vehicle. For example, if a product was only capable of storing a consumer's payment credentials for other accounts but was incapable of having funds stored on it, such a product would not have been a prepaid account. However, if a product allowed a consumer to transfer funds, which could be stored before the consumer designated a destination for the funds, the product would have satisfied proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(A).",
                        "With these examples, the Bureau sought to make clear that it did not intend to extend the proposed definition of prepaid account to a product that could never store funds. To the extent that a digital wallet, for example, merely stores payment credentials (e.g., a consumer's bank account or payment card information), rather than storing the funds themselves, the digital wallet would not have been considered a prepaid account under the proposed rule. If, however, a digital wallet allowed a consumer to store funds in it directly, then the digital wallet would have been a prepaid account if the other criteria of the proposed definition were also met. Finally, proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-6 would have provided that prepaid accounts did not have to be reloadable by the consumer or a third party."

                        "As discussed above, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to limit the final rule to those products that could be reloaded by a consumer, arguing that such products were more likely to act as transaction account substitutes. Those comments are summarized in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) above. In short, these commenters argued that, to the extent the Bureau was seeking to create a uniform regulatory regime for like products, non-reloadable products did not function like other accounts already covered by Regulation E and thus should be excluded from coverage. They noted, for example, that non-reloadable cards were not generally accompanied by an expectation of a continued relationship between the financial institution and the consumer. In addition, these commenters argued, such accounts were largely used as a substitute for cash, such that adding disclosure and other substantive requirements to these cards would add unnecessary complexity that would far outweigh consumer expectations or needs with respect to these products. Commenters also noted that with respect to many types of non-reloadable cards, such as cards used to disburse insurance claim proceeds or tax refunds, consumers did not in fact have a choice with respect to which card they received. Comparison shopping in such circumstances, they argued, was unhelpful. Finally, with respect to the Bureau's proposed rationale that including non-reloadable accounts in the definition of prepaid account would help prevent evasion, a trade association stated that they believed that such evasion was unlikely, and further argued that the Bureau could address this risk through the adoption of an anti-evasion provision specifically aimed at preventing financial institutions from morphing their products to avoid coverage under this rule.",
                        "With respect to the clarification in proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-5 that the prepaid account definition only covered accounts that were capable of holding funds (rather than just acting as a pass-through), several commenters, including issuing banks, a payment network, a digital wallet provider, and a consumer group, agreed with the proposed approach. These commenters asserted that, to the extent a digital wallet was simply acting as a pass-through of credentials for accounts that were already protected under Regulation E (or other regulations), consumers using those digital wallets were already receiving sufficient protections. As stated in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) above, other commenters objected to the Bureau's decision to cover digital wallets under the rule in any respect."

Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(1) defines a prepaid account, in part, as an account that is issued on a prepaid basis in a specified amount or not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter. In addition, the Bureau is finalizing proposed comments 2(b)(3)(i)-3, -4, -5, and -6, renumbered as comments 2(b)(3)(i)-4, -5, -6, and -7, largely as proposed, with some minor revisions for clarity.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe that it would be inappropriate to exclude a product from the definition of prepaid account based on whether it can be reloaded or who can (or cannot) load funds into the account. The Bureau notes that products that may limit consumers from loading funds include payroll card accounts, which are already subject to Regulation E. Other products reloadable only by a third party also may hold funds which similarly represent a meaningful portion of a consumer's available funds. This may be true, for example, for students receiving financial aid disbursements or a consumer receiving worker's compensation payments. The Bureau believes that, like consumers relying on payroll card accounts,\n          consumers may use these products as transaction account substitutes for a substantial period of time even when consumers cannot reload the cards themselves, and thus such products should be similarly protected. In addition, while it is true that non-reloadable products are distinct from transaction accounts (to the extent that the funds will eventually be spent down in their entirety and the account abandoned), while the accounts are in use, they may be used to conduct a significant portion of a consumer's transactions or hold a substantial portion of a consumer's funds, and as such the Bureau believes that they warrant the protections of Regulation E, including error resolution in particular. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that extending protections to all broadly usable prepaid accounts is necessary to avoid consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts. Finally, the Bureau remains concerned that, if it were to exclude non-reloadable cards from the definition of prepaid account, a financial institution could evade the Bureau's rulemaking on prepaid accounts by issuing non-reloadable cards repeatedly to the same consumer, such as to provide repeated disbursements (e.g., providing a new student loan disbursement card each semester). The Bureau does not believe that an anti-evasion provision is the optimal method for dealing with this concern; rather, the Bureau is concerned that, at this time, such a provision would in fact cause some uncertainty without addressing all other concerns.",
                        "The Bureau also is not persuaded by commenters' objections to the Bureau's proposal to cover digital wallets that can hold funds under the definition of prepaid account. The Bureau continues to believe that digital wallets that can hold funds operate in large part in a similar manner to physical or online prepaid accounts\u2014a consumer can load funds into the account, spend the funds at multiple, unaffiliated merchants (or conduct P2P transfers), and reload the account once the funds are depleted. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that consumers who transact using digital wallets deserve the same protections as consumers who use other prepaid accounts. Indeed, as with other prepaid accounts, a consumer's digital wallet could fall victim to erroneous or fraudulent transactions. In addition, while the Bureau understands that most digital wallets available today do not typically charge many fees (with few exceptions, such as, for example, foreign exchange fees in certain circumstances or a fee for having funds from the account issued to the consumer in the form of a check), it is impossible to rule out that existing or new digital wallet providers will charge such fees in the future. If fees do become standard in this space, consumers ought to know what those fees are and when they will be imposed."

A number of commenters, including a payment network and an industry trade association, noted a specific lack of clarity with respect to products that could arguably qualify as both. To illustrate, they noted that some prepaid accounts offer preauthorized check-writing capability, while some checking accounts allow consumers to transact using the ACH routing number or online passcode. These commenters asked the Bureau to resolve this ambiguity.",

In addition to those changes, the Bureau is also adding a third prong to \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(3), only accounts that are not otherwise a checking account, a share draft account, or a NOW account will qualify as a prepaid account. For purposes of this element, the Bureau does not consider the capability to issue preauthorized checks to qualify an account as checking, share draft, or NOW accounts. The Bureau notes that it intended to exclude checking and other demand deposit accounts from the proposed definition of prepaid account by including the phrase \u201cnot otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\u201d The Bureau acknowledges, however, that its proposed approach did not sufficiently resolve the potential ambiguity referenced by commenters. The Bureau believes that its express reference in final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(3) to the account not being a checking, share draft, or NOW account, together with the primary function test in final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(2), more directly address these concerns."

                "The proposal explained that, although the Bureau understands that most prepaid accounts do not charge per transaction fees for purchases of goods or services from a merchant, some do. The Bureau said that the impact of these fees could be substantial for consumers who make multiple purchases. Often these fees are charged when periodic fees are not, and thus a consumer may be choosing between a prepaid account that has no monthly fee but charges for each purchase and a prepaid account that has a monthly fee but no per purchase charge. Therefore, the Bureau believed it appropriate for all prepaid accounts to disclose on the short form both whether there is a per purchase fee and, if so, the fee for making those purchases. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed the per purchase fees on the top line of the short form.",
                "The Bureau's proposed rule further recognized that a handful of prepaid accounts charge a different per purchase fee depending on whether the purchase is processed as a signature or PIN transaction. While PIN debit transactions require input of the accountholder's PIN code at the time of authorization of the transaction, for a signature transaction, the accountholder may sign for the transaction but does not need to enter his or her PIN code. The Bureau therefore proposed model forms for prepaid accounts that disclose both fees for these two authorization methods.",
                "No commenters objected to inclusion of per purchase fees generally in the short form disclosure. An industry trade association, an issuing bank, and a program manager commented on the relevance of requiring the separate disclosure of per purchase fees for PIN and signature. These commenters said that such methods may become obsolete with the evolution of new cardholder verification methods (CVMs) and that many current transactions do not technically require either PIN or signature, such as online purchases. These commenters, plus another industry trade association and the office of a State Attorney General, suggested permitting disclosure of one per purchase fee if the PIN and signature fees are the same. The office of a State Attorney General also urged the Bureau to ban per purchase fees for payroll card accounts.",
                "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(2), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii), with certain modifications as described below. Because a per purchase fee could be significant for consumers who make multiple purchases with their prepaid card, the Bureau continues to believe it appropriate for all prepaid accounts to disclose on the short form whether there is a per purchase fee and, if so, the fee for making a purchase. However, the Bureau understands that most prepaid accounts do not charge fees for each purchase transaction and, for those that do, the Bureau believes that distinguishing between PIN and signature when other methods of cardholder verification may now or in the future be available may be confusing to consumers. The Bureau further understands that new cardholder verification methods are rapidly evolving. For these reasons, the Bureau believes disclosure of the breakdown of specific per purchase fees has less consumer benefit than disclosure of one per purchase fee, i.e., the highest fee charged for making a purchase as required pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i), which is discussed in detail below. Thus, the Bureau is finalizing this provision as proposed, except it is requiring disclosure of only a single fee for making a purchase using the prepaid account instead of requiring disclosure of two fees (both for when a consumer uses a PIN and when a consumer uses a signature to verify the purchase). The Bureau has also made other technical revisions to this provision for clarity.",

For each fee, an agency would have had to disclose the amount of the fee, the conditions, if any, under which the fee may have been imposed, waived, or reduced, and, to the extent known, whether any third-party fees would have been applied. These disclosures pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.15(f) and 1005.18(f) would have had to include all of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) and would have needed to be provided in a form substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(e).

According to this commenter, as well as a trade association and issuing bank, an ATM is one of the most expensive ways for consumers to check their balance on a prepaid card.

See final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iii).",
                "Thus, for the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(D), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iii), with substantial modifications. Specifically, the Bureau is requiring a more fulsome disclosure regarding insurance, as well as the statement directing the consumer to register the account, where applicable. The Bureau has made other technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.",
                "Unlike the proposal, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) requires that financial institutions disclose a statement regarding eligibility for FDIC deposit insurance or NCUA share insurance, as appropriate, rather than just a statement in situations where the prepaid account was not eligible for insurance. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) also requires that the statement direct the consumer to register the prepaid account for insurance and other account protections, where applicable, which had been a separate provision in the proposal. In addition, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iii) requires an explanation of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage and the benefit of such coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage, as applicable. New comment 18(b)(4)(iii)-1 provides examples illustrating how this disclosure might be made for FDIC and NCUA insurance in certain circumstances, and cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 for guidance as to when NCUA insurance coverage should be disclosed instead of FDIC insurance coverage.",
                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi), the Bureau is persuaded by commenters, the results of its post-proposal consumer testing, and information received during the interagency consultation process that the registration and insurance disclosures should be combined, and that both the existence as well as the lack of insurance eligibility should be disclosed. The Bureau also believes that mirroring the \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) disclosure in the long form will assist consumers in comparison shopping and reinforce the need to register prepaid accounts, where applicable.",
                "As discussed above, while the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that some consumers erroneously equate FDIC coverage with fraud or theft protection, a number of participants understood that the insurance protects consumers' funds in the case of bank insolvency.\n        Absent the space limitations of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes the long form disclosure provides an optimal opportunity to briefly, but more fully, explain the implications of insurance coverage or lack thereof. The Bureau does not believe it necessary to prescribe the exact content of this disclosure because circumstances may vary for a particular prepaid account program; thus, the final rule requires only that the long form include (in addition to the statement required in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi)) an explanation of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage and the benefit of such coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage, as applicable.",
                "As noted above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi), the final rule refers to NCUA, rather than NCUSIF, insurance for credit unions. After further consideration and based on information received during the interagency consultation process, the Bureau believes the term \u201cNCUA\u201d may be more meaningful to consumers than \u201cNCUSIF\u201d and has revised the disclosures accordingly in both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) and (4)(iii)."

For each fee type, the financial institution would have had to disclose the amount of the fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. This would include, to the extent known, any third-party fee amounts that may apply. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would also have required that if such third-party fees may apply but the amount of those fees are not known, a financial institution would have had to instead include a statement indicating that third-party fees may apply without specifying the fee amount. Under the proposal, a fee imposed by a third party that acts as an agent of the financial institution for purposes of the prepaid account always would have had to be disclosed.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would have also stated that a financial institution may not utilize any symbols, such as asterisks, to explain the conditions under which any fee may be imposed. The Bureau believed it is important that consumers be able to easily follow the information in the long form, and that, when financial institutions do not face space constraints like on the short form, text should be used to explain any information about fees, instead of relying on a consumer first to notice symbols and then associate them with text in a footnote.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed to add commentary to explain the format of the long form disclosure. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-1 would have explained that, for example, if a financial institution charges a cash reload fee, the financial institution must list the amount of the cash reload fee and also specify any circumstances under which a consumer can qualify for a lower fee. The proposed comment would have further explained that relevant conditions to disclose could also include, for example, if there is a limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a transaction or during a particular time period.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-2 would have explained that a financial institution may, at its option, choose to disclose pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), any service or feature it provides or offers even if it does not charge a fee for that service or feature. The proposed comment would have clarified that, for example, a financial institution may choose to list \u201conline bill pay service\u201d and indicate that the fee is \u201c$0\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that service or feature. By contrast, where a service or feature is available without a fee for an introductory period, but where a fee may be imposed at the conclusion of the introductory period for that service or feature, the financial institution could not indicate that the fee is \u201c$0.\u201d The proposed comment would have clarified that the financial institution should instead list the main fee and explain in the separate explanatory column how the fee could be lower during the introductory period, what that alternative fee would be, and when it will be imposed. Similarly, if a consumer must enroll in an additional service to avoid incurring a fee for another service, neither of those services should disclose a fee of \u201c$0,\u201d but should instead list each fee amount imposed if a consumer does not enroll. The proposed comment also would have provided an example that if the monthly fee is waived once a consumer receives direct deposit payments into the prepaid account, the monthly fee imposed upon a consumer if they do not receive direct deposit would be disclosed in the long form, and an explanation regarding how receiving direct deposit might lower the fee should be included in the explanatory column in the long form.",
                        "Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-3 would have provided guidance on the disclosure of third-party fees in the long form disclosure. Specifically, the proposed comment would have explained that, for example, a financial institution that offers balance updates to a consumer via text message would disclose that mobile carrier data charges may apply for each text message a consumer receives. Regarding the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), a financial institution must always disclose in the long form any fees imposed by a third party who is acting as an agent of the financial institution for purposes of the prepaid account product, the proposed comment would have provided an example that any fees that the provider of a cash reload service who has a relationship with the financial institution may impose would have had to be disclosed in the long form."

See the section-by-section analysis \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above for discussion of such comments and the Bureau's reasoning for finalizing the overall requirement to disclose the long form.",
                        "With regard to recommendations for the specific content of the long form disclosure, two issuing banks requested that the Bureau limit the proposed requirement to disclose on the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account by eliminating disclosure of optional, incidental services. The commenters said such features generally are not available at the time of purchase and are disclosed in a prepaid account program's terms and conditions at the time the consumer elects such services. The commenter asserted that mandating disclosure of fees connected with such services would add complexity to the long form disclosure and discourage financial institutions from creating new features and enhanced functionality due to the burden of having to update the disclosure and distribute new packaging.",
                        "Two consumer group commenters and individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group generally supported the long form disclosures' proposed scope and urged the Bureau to add additional content requirements, such as disclosure of when funds become available after consumer deposits via ATM, teller, and remote deposit capture; free ways to get cash such as cash back at point of sale when making a purchase; and the number of surcharge-free ATM withdrawals available to the consumer. One consumer group commenter suggested that the Bureau's proposed sample long form disclosure was ambiguous in certain places regarding fees disclosure, particularly with respect to payroll card account fees.",

                        "Several industry commenters, including trade associations, issuing banks, program managers, and a payment network recommended eliminating the requirement to disclose third-party fees in the long form disclosure. They said it is not practical to disclose third-party fees because the amount, timing, and frequency of such fees are outside of the control of the financial institution and because any changes in such fees would require updates to the long form disclosure and change-in-fee notices. Some industry commenters urged the Bureau to require instead a general disclosure that third-party fees may apply or a more specific disclosure that third-party fees apply with information on how to obtain the specific fee information. A consumer group supported the disclosure of third-party fees in the long form as a method of creating a fair comparison among financial institutions that use third parties to load cash into prepaid accounts and those with proprietary cash reload systems."

Most significantly, as explained below, the final rule contains several additional accommodations regarding disclosure of third-party fees in the long form. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comments 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-1 through -4, renumbered as 18(b)(4)(ii)-1 through -4, with certain revisions as discussed below. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule and commentary for conformity and clarity.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that pre-acquisition disclosures of all fees for prepaid accounts will, consistent with EFTA section 902 and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, and ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account. The Bureau also believes that the long form disclosure will, in many ways, be similar to what many financial institutions currently disclose regarding prepaid accounts' fee structures in their prepaid account agreements, although pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) the long form disclosure will be provided to consumers as a stand-alone document before they acquire a prepaid account (unless the exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) or (iii) applies).",

The Bureau is finalizing as proposed the requirement that the financial institution disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. The final rule also requires that a financial institution may not use any symbols, such as an asterisk, to explain conditions under which any fee may be imposed. The final rule further states that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer.",
                        "As discussed above, some industry commenters urged the Bureau not to require disclosure of all fees on the long form. The Bureau believes that this requirement is necessary to help consumers understand, both prior to and after purchase, the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts and ensure that account features are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed in a manner that permits consumer understanding of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the prepaid account. Furthermore, because the short form discloses a limited number of fees and few conditions, this requirement is necessary so that the long form disclosure can provide the full amount of information unabridged.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau believes there should be a comprehensive disclosure to which a consumer can turn prior to purchasing a prepaid account for straightforward information on all fees and the circumstances under which they may be imposed. The Bureau is not requiring disclosure in the long form of additional information related to fees as requested by some commenters because the Bureau believes disclosing fee amounts and the conditions under which they may be imposed provides consumers with the most important information they need to have access to pre-acquisition. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions include details in their account agreements' fee schedules about free services, and the Bureau encourages financial institutions to continue to do so. To provide support to the proposed commentary regarding how to disclose free services and features, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text a sentence stating that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer.",
                        "While the Bureau is generally permitting formatting flexibility on the long form disclosure, the Bureau also is adopting the prohibition in the proposed rule against using any symbol, such as an asterisk, to explain the conditions in the long form disclosure under which any fee may be imposed. The Bureau continues to believe that it is important that consumers can easily follow the information in the long form disclosure and, absent the space constraints of the short form disclosure, the financial institution is able to explain any information about fees directly instead of relying on consumers to notice symbols and then associate them with explanatory text.",
                        "Regarding the consumer group's comment that the Bureau's proposed sample long form disclosure was ambiguous in certain places regarding fees disclosure, particularly with respect to payroll card account fees, the Bureau notes that the sample long form is meant to provide an example to aid financial institutions in complying with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4). Financial institutions, including those offering payroll card accounts, should ensure that their long form disclosures accurately reflect the fees and features of their prepaid accounts.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-1 explains that the requirement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) that a financial institution disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account and is not limited to just fees for EFTs or the right to make transfers. It further explains that the requirement to disclose all fees in the long form includes any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61 but does not include finance charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature as described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(i). The comment cross-references comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 for guidance on disclosure of finance charges as part of the \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) fee disclosure in the long form. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may also be required to include finance charges in the Regulation Z disclosures required pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii).",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-2 elaborates on the disclosure of conditions in the long form. The comment provides several examples illustrating how a financial institution would disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include on the long form disclosure additional information or limitations related to the service or feature for which a fee is charged, such as, for cash reloads, any limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a single transaction or during a particular time period. Finally, the comment clarifies that the general requirement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) does not apply to individual fee waivers or reductions granted to a particular consumer or group of consumers on a discretionary or case-by-case basis.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-3 addresses disclosure of a service or feature without a charge. It reiterates the provision in the rule that a financial institution may, but is not required to, list in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer. For example, a financial institution may list \u201conline bill pay\u201d in its long form disclosure and indicate a fee amount of \u201c$0\u201d when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that feature. The Bureau agrees that such services should be disclosed as $0, rather than \u201cfree,\u201d as requested by one industry commenter, because having a single standardized approach is shorter, simpler, and clearer for consumers to use to compare fees across prepaid accounts.",
                        "Comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-3 further explains, however, that where a fee is waived or reduced under certain circumstances or where a service or feature is available for an introductory period without a fee, the financial institution may not list the fee amount as \u201c$0\u201d or \u201cfree.\u201d Rather, the financial institution must list the highest fee, accompanied by an explanation of the waived or reduced fee amount and any conditions for the waiver or discount. The comment also provides several examples.",
                        "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, particularly for those sold at retail locations, and changes may require pulling and replacing or providing appropriate change-in-terms notices.",
                        "If a financial institution is making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program, a financial institution may provide new customers disclosures in accordance with \u00a7\u20091005.7(c) post-acquisition, without needing to pull and replace card packaging that does not reflect that new optional feature in any disclosure contained inside the package in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.7 and 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), (b)(4)(ii), and (f)(1). The Bureau intends to monitor financial institutions' practices in this area, however, and may consider additional requirements in a future rulemaking if necessary.",
                        "Disclosure of third-party fees. With regard to disclosure of third-party fees in the long form, the Bureau is finalizing the general proposed requirement that financial institutions disclose in the long form any third-party fee amounts known to the financial institution that may apply, but making changes regarding the wording and updating of the disclosure to address commenter concerns.",
                        "Specifically, the final rule provides that for any such third-party fee disclosed, the financial institution may, but is not required to, include a statement that the fee is accurate as of or through a specific date, a statement that the third-party fee is subject to change, or both statements. As in the proposal, if a third-party fee may apply but the amount of that fee is not known by the financial institution, the final rule requires that the long form disclosure include a statement indicating that the third-party fee may apply without specifying the fee amount.",
                        "The Bureau moved language clarifying disclosure of fees by a party acting on behalf of the financial institution from the proposed regulatory text to the commentary in the final rule. Specifically, comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-4 clarifies that fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed on the long form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii).",
                        "The final rule also provides that a financial institution is not required to revise the long form disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) to reflect a fee change by a third party until such time that the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the long form disclosure. Thus, whether for a prepaid account program with packaging material or for one with only online or oral disclosures, the financial institution must update the long form to disclose a third-party fee change when it otherwise updates its long form disclosure. Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-4 provides an example illustrating a disclosure on the long form of a third-party fee when that fee is known to a financial institution and an example of when it is not.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3) above, the comprehensive design of the long form disclosure is better suited to inform consumers about the details of fee variations and third-party fees than the short form disclosure for which, due to its abridged nature, the final rule disallows disclosure of most third-party fees. Indeed, the Bureau believes that the comprehensiveness of the long form disclosure would be compromised by the exclusion of third-party fees, which would result in consumers not being made aware of all fees they could incur in connection with the prepaid account. The Bureau believes the final rule strikes an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure in the long form of third-party fees but providing, among other things, a safe harbor regarding reprinting or otherwise updating the long form disclosure when a third-party fee changes and a general statement for situations in which a financial institution does not know the amount of the third-party fee.",
                        "Disclosing the date as of or through which a third-party fee is accurate, the fact that the third-party fee is subject to change, or both provides flexibility to alert consumers to the limitations of the financial institution's knowledge about third-party fees. The Bureau also believes that it reduces the need to require instantaneous updates as third-party fees shift. Regarding the safe harbor for reprinting due to third-party fee changes, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require updates of these third-party fees when the financial institution prints new packaging materials or, if there are no packaging materials, when the financial institution otherwise updates the long form disclosure."

                        "As discussed above, the Bureau believed that consumers commonly incur these top-line fees when a financial institution imposes charges for these services. In the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, participants reported that these fee disclosures were the most important to them.\n          The Bureau recognized that a financial institution may not charge all of the fees identified in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (4). For example, a financial institution might not charge any per purchase fees when it imposes a monthly fee. The Bureau, however, still believed that such fees should be disclosed in a more prominent and larger font size than other information on the short form disclosure in order to draw consumers' attention to this information before acquiring a prepaid account. The Bureau also proposed that pixel sizes used correspond to the font sizes specified because font sizes can vary when applied in electronic contexts. Though the font sizes may differ, the Bureau explained that the relative sizes of the components of the short form would have to remain consistent to maintain the visual hierarchy of information included in the form.",

As discussed in the recap of the proposal above, the Bureau believed that, while these other fees are important for a consumer to know pre-acquisition, the Bureau believed that these fees are less likely to drive most consumers' acquisition decisions when shopping among prepaid accounts and thus should be disclosed using a smaller font size.",

The Bureau is adopting the actual size requirements as proposed, with the addition of size requirements that were unspecified in the proposed rule. The Bureau has also replaced the proposed requirement that certain portions of the short form disclosure be more prominent with the more specific requirement that such disclosures appear in bold-faced type to clarify that other methods of illustrating prominence, such as italicized type, would not be deemed compliant. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.",
                        "As stated in the proposal and above, the top line of the short form disclosure uses prominence and relative type size to highlight what the Bureau's research indicates are the fees that are most important to consumers when selecting a prepaid account. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) appear as follows: Fee amounts in bold-faced type; single fee amounts in a minimum type size of 15 points (or 21 pixels); two-tier fee amounts for ATM withdrawal in a minimum type size of 11 points (or 16 pixels) and in no larger a type size than what is used for the single fee amounts; and fee headings in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and in no larger a type size than what is used for the single fee amounts.",
                        "Echoing the proposed rule, the next rung of the visual hierarchy for the short form disclosure includes the remaining fees and the statements regarding additional fee types. The Bureau continues to believe that this information, while important, is not as crucial as the top-line information in driving consumer acquisition decisions and, thus, merits disclosure in a relatively smaller type size. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(v) through (ix) appear in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and appear in the same or a smaller type size than what is used for the fee headings required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv).",
                        "As in the proposed rule, the final rung of the visual hierarchy for the short form disclosure includes the statements required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii). The Bureau believes that this information, while important, is secondary to the fee information provided in larger type above the statements. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii) appear in a minimum type size of seven points (or nine pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required to be disclosed by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(v) through (ix).",
                        "While the proposal would have required that certain disclosures in the short form be more prominent than other parts of the disclosure, the final rule specifies that those disclosures appear in bold-faced type. The Bureau believes that the statement regarding the number of additional fee types should be in bold-faced type to alert consumers that the short form does not disclose all fee types that the consumer may incur using that particular prepaid account and to inform them of the total number of additional fee types that could be charged. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, in the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing, participants expressed interest in knowing more about these fee types.\n          Relatedly, the Bureau believes it is important to direct consumers to the source from which consumers can learn about these additional fee types and other information about the prepaid account program. The Bureau believes that standardized and consistent use of bold-faced type for elements the Bureau believes merit greater prominence supports the overall goal of the short form disclosure to provide consumers with clear and easy-to-read information that will enhance their prepaid account purchase and use decisions. Therefore, the final rule requires that the statements disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (x) and the telephone number and Web site URL disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii), where applicable, must appear in bold-faced type. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) above, the Bureau believes the statement regarding the availability of an overdraft credit feature must stand out to consumers.",
                        "Finally, the final rule sets forth the smallest type size requirements for the remaining elements of the short form disclosure, which provide the details of certain fees. The final rule requires that text used to distinguish each of the two-tier fees pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(iii), (v), (vi), and (ix), to explain that the fee required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi) applies \u201cper call,\u201d where applicable, or to explain the conditions that trigger an inactivity fee and that the fee applies monthly, or for the applicable time period, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vii) appear in a minimum type size of six points (or eight pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii)."

The Bureau notes that Regulation DD requires that periodic statements disclose all fees debited to accounts covered by that regulation.\n        Regulation DD defines \u201caccount\u201d to mean \u201ca deposit account at a depository institution that is held by or offered to a consumer.

To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require inclusion of all fees charged. These revisions will assist consumers' understanding of their prepaid account activity. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because the Bureau believes that comprehensive disclosure of fee information will help ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers, over the term of the product or service, in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with prepaid accounts.",
                "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4) states that a financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on any periodic statement provided pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.9(b) and on any history of account transactions provided or made available by the financial institution.",

For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).",

The Bureau received no comments on this issue and the Bureau is making no additional changes to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4) other than those discussed herein."

                        "As discussed in the proposal, to preserve the design integrity of the short form and long form disclosures, which the Bureau believes will facilitate consumer engagement and optimal consumer comprehension, it is necessary that the information in these disclosures be restricted to that required or permitted under this final rule. Thus, the final rule requires that the short form and long form disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2) and (4) must be segregated from other information and must contain only information that is required or permitted for those disclosures by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b).",
                        "New comment 18(b)(7)(iii)-1 addresses information permitted outside the short form and long form disclosures.

Similarly, the comment explains that the segregation requirement does not prohibit a financial institution from providing the long form disclosure on the same page as other disclosures or information, or as part of a larger document, such as the prepaid account agreement, cross-referencing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1) and (f)(1).",
                        "Thus, as long as the long form disclosure remains intact and free of extraneous information not required or permitted within its structure, neither the segregation requirement nor any other part of the final rule prohibits disclosure of the long form as part of the cardholder agreement. Thus, the long form may be disclosed as a separate document or may be inserted intact within another document such as the cardholder agreement.",

The Bureau believes it is necessary to preserve the design integrity of the short form and long form disclosures for all types of prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii), all fees and conditions, including those required by State law, must be disclosed in the long form disclosure. Thus, inclusion of State-required information in the long form (with regard to fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed for the prepaid account) would not only not violate the segregation requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(iii) but exclusion of this information would violate the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) to disclose all fees and conditions. The Bureau acknowledges, however, that State laws may have other specific presentation requirements for their disclosures that may not correspond to the final rule's requirements for the long form as set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) and (6)(iii)(A) and thus may necessitate additional disclosure in a format that complies with those requirements.",

Pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the final rule permits disclosure in the short form for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii)) of a statement directing consumers to State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers, whether this information is located on the same page as (but outside) the short form disclosure or in another location such as the cardholder agreement or on a Web site.",

                "EFTA section 908 governs the timing and other requirements for consumers and financial institutions pertaining to error resolution, including provisional credit, and is implemented for accounts under Regulation E generally, including payroll card accounts, in \u00a7\u20091005.11. Section 1005.11(c)(1) and (3)(i) require that a financial institution, after receiving notice that a consumer believes an EFT from the consumer's account was not authorized, must investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred (i.e., whether the transfer was unauthorized), within 10 business days (20 business days if the EFT occurred within 30 days of the first deposit to the account). Existing \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2) provides that if the financial institution is unable to complete the investigation within 10 business days, its investigation may take up to 45 days if it provisionally credits the amount of the alleged error back to the consumer's account within 10 business days of receiving the error notice.\n        Provisional credit is not required if the financial institution requests but does not receive written confirmation within 10 business days of an oral notice by the consumer, or if the alleged error involves an account that is subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Securities Credit by Brokers and Dealers, 12 CFR part 220).",
                "The Bureau proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2) to extend to all prepaid accounts the error resolution provisions of Regulation E, including provisional credit, with modifications to the \u00a7\u20091005.11 timing requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2) for financial institutions following the periodic statement alternative in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1). In addition, the Bureau proposed to use its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to propose \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3); that provision would have provided that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, if a financial institution disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice that is substantially similar to the proposed notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7, a financial institution would not have been required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements under \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it had not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification.",
                "As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau is revising the limitation on financial institutions' obligations to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for prepaid accounts that have not completed the consumer identification and verification process. Rather than allow financial institutions to forego providing all of the limited liability and error resolution protections for such unverified accounts, as the Bureau proposed, the final rule allows financial institutions to forego extending provisional credit to such accounts as part of the error resolution process\u2014under the final rule, therefore, financial institutions may take up to 45 days (or 90 days, where applicable) to investigate an error claim without provisionally crediting the account in the amount at issue for prepaid accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. To implement this revision, the Bureau is adopting an exception to the general requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2) that a financial institution must provide provisional credit if it takes longer than 10 business days to investigate and determine whether an error occurred. As stated above, there are two existing exceptions listed in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) (no provisional credit where institution required, but did not receive, written confirmation of the oral notice of error within 10 business days) and \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(B) (no provisional credit where error involves an account subject to the Board's Regulation T). The Bureau is adding a third exception in new \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(C), which, together with \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i), provides that a financial institution does not have to provisionally credit a consumer's account if the alleged error involves a prepaid account, other than a payroll card account or government benefit account, for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process, as set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3)(ii).\n        The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to finalize this exclusion pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers.",
                "By adding an exception for unverified accounts to the provisional credit requirement set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i), the Bureau intends to clarify the scope of the revised exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3). Specifically, although the Bureau is finalizing a provision that would allow financial institutions not to extend provisional credit to prepaid accounts for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process, all other timing and related requirements set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c), as modified by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(2), will apply to both verified and unverified accounts. The addition of new \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(C), therefore, is intended to make clear that accounts referenced in that provision are only exempted from the provisional credit requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i), and not from any other provisions of \u00a7\u20091005.11(c). Final \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) and 1005.18(e)(3) reference each other for added clarity.",

This information would have been disclosed on any periodic statement provided pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.9(b), in any electronic history of account transactions whether provided pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) or otherwise, and on any written history of account transactions provided pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).

Proposed comment 18(c)-5 would have also explained that the fees that must be included in the summary total include those that are required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A). For example, an institution would have been required to include the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM in the summary total of fees, but it would not have been required to include any fee charged by an ATM operator with whom the institution has no relationship for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM.",

                        "The Bureau received comments from several consumer groups, who supported this portion of the proposal and argued that setting apart monthly and year-to-date fee totals would help consumers understand the costs associated with their accounts and how to minimize fees. These commenters stated that financial institutions should also be required to include a statement that indicates actions consumers can take to lower their fees, such as using network ATMs.",
                        "Several industry groups, including program managers, issuing banks, credit unions, and a trade association generally supported this portion of the proposal and the goal of providing consumers access to information needed to manage their prepaid accounts, but cautioned that implementing the requirement as proposed would require more time than the proposed nine-month compliance period and would require costly system updates. For example, a credit union explained that the proposed summary total of fees requirement would be complex and burdensome for a financial institution that houses its data with a third-party processor and stated that retrieving the data to perform the analysis would be costly. In addition, an issuing bank explained that the proposal would require changes to the prepaid account processing infrastructure design and stated that those changes would be inconsistent with how statements are calculated for checking and other consumer asset accounts that tend to share the same processing infrastructure. A government benefits card program manager argued that, because the summary totals requirement would take significant time and investments to implement, the Bureau should exempt government benefit accounts from this aspect of the proposal. A program manager argued that the summary totals requirement would not be appropriate for non-reloadable products. A program manager requested that, for financial institutions that do not have the data to calculate the summary totals as of the final rule's effective date, the requirement be implemented on a going-forward basis only.",
                        "Regarding the proposed requirement to disclose the summary totals of fees specifically, these commenters stated that they recognize the value in providing aggregated fees paid over time and therefore support the overall goal the Bureau seeks to achieve by including this provision. However, several industry commenters, including program managers and issuing banks, urged the Bureau to require financial institutions to include in the summary totals of fees only fees that are discernible to the financial institution. These commenters explained that a transaction that includes a third-party fee, such as an out-of-network ATM fee, may not separate the fee portion from the total amount and therefore determining the fee amounts for each consumer would be costly and burdensome. These commenters also stated that financial institutions cannot provide details about or accurately disclose those fees. An issuing bank stated that a financial institution also cannot determine whether a fee was waived due to the consumer's relationship with the third party. One consumer group argued, however, that financial institutions can determine the amounts of third-party fees. This commenter explained that, if a consumer withdraws $40 in cash from an ATM that charges a $2.50 out-of-network fee, the withdrawal will appear as $42.50, and the financial institution would be able to discern the $2.50 third-party fee. A payroll card program manager requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to provide a form disclaimer regarding fees that are outside of the financial institution's control or an example showing consumers when such fees may occur. Another program manager requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to distinguish fees for using a prepaid account (such as per transaction fees), optional fees, and third-party fees.",
                        "Several industry commenters also suggested other modifications to this aspect of the proposal, which they believed would minimize the costs and burdens to industry. For example, a credit union requested that financial institutions not be required to provide paper statements displaying the summary totals of fees and argued that displaying fees on electronic statements is sufficient and the most appropriate way to communicate with consumers. Another credit union and a program manager requested that the year-to-date calculation be eliminated. The credit union argued that consumers usually find year-to-date totals confusing and can instead calculate their own totals using the information available online. On the other hand, another program manager argued that that the proposed summary by calendar month is overly proscriptive and inconsistent with consumer usage and preference. This commenter explained that the transaction history begins on the date of the first transaction (not the first day of the month) and continues until the account is closed or becomes inactive for a period of time.",
                        "One issuing bank opposed this portion of the proposal altogether, arguing that providing summary totals of fees would not help consumers understand how to limit such fees, unless the summary distinguishes behavior-based fees (i.e., fees that apply to certain conduct engaged in by the accountholder, such as out-of-network ATM fees) from service-based fees (i.e., fees that apply to all accountholders without regard to conduct, such as monthly fees). This commenter also requested, if the Bureau decides to finalize this portion of the proposal, that the Bureau clarify definitions for the terms fee, deposit, and debit."

To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require a summary total of both monthly and annual fees. These proposed revisions will assist consumers' understanding of their prepaid account activity. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because the Bureau believes that disclosure of these summary totals of fees will help ensure that the features of prepaid accounts, over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with prepaid accounts.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing the requirement that financial institutions provide the summary totals of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution against the consumer's prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date. The Bureau has removed the requirement that financial institutions provide summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a consumer's prepaid account from the final rule.",
                        "The Bureau believes the final rule will provide consumers important information for better understanding and managing their prepaid accounts. The Bureau agrees with commenters that displaying the summary totals of fees is valuable to consumers and believes the requirement will be an important consumer education and money management tool that will help consumers understand the actual costs of using their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that this requirement will be beneficial to consumers of all prepaid accounts, including government benefit accounts, and is therefore not exempting any accounts from this requirement. The Bureau is not, however, requiring financial institutions to include a statement that indicates actions consumers can take to lower their fees, as requested by consumer group commenters. The Bureau does not believe such a requirement justifies the additional costs to financial institutions at this time. However, the Bureau believes it is beneficial for financial institution to educate and inform consumers on how to avoid fees, as many do currently. The Bureau will continue to monitor industry practice and may revisit this issue at a later time.",
                        "The Bureau believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide the summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a prepaid account will not harm consumers. The Bureau believes that consumers likely know how much money is deposited into and debited out of their accounts and can easily calculate this information by using the data from their transaction history and account balance. In addition, the Bureau believes that the modification to limit the summary totals requirement to fees only and the modifications to the rule's effective date discussed below addresses industry commenters' concerns about not having sufficient time to implement the requirement.",

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) above, consumers value receiving information about their accounts in both electronic and paper forms. The Bureau believes that it is important for consumers to have access to summary totals of fees for their accounts regardless of the method by which they access their account information.",
                        "The Bureau is not requiring that third-party fees, such as out-of-network ATM fees and cash reload fees, be included in the summary totals. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5) provides, in part, that the summary totals consist of fees assessed by the financial institution against the consumer's account, as explained further in comment 18(c)-8.ii, discussed below. The Bureau agrees with industry commenters that, even if financial institutions can determine whether third-party fees were assessed against a prepaid account, requiring them to extract details about such fees could be problematic for financial institutions, especially for transactions that involve foreign currency conversion calculations. The Bureau notes that third-party cash reload fees do not need to be included in the summary totals of fees. This is different from how cash reload fees are treated in the pre-acquisition disclosures context, where financial institutions must include third-party cash reload fees on the short form disclosure.",
                        "Regarding a program manager's request to permit financial institutions to distinguish fees in the fee totals, noted above, the Bureau agrees that allowing some flexibility in how financial institutions display summary totals of fees may be beneficial to consumers. The Bureau has clarified in comment 18(c)-9, discussed below, that financial institutions may also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that all disclosures should be clear and readily understandable as required by \u00a7\u20091005.4(a), including the summary totals of fees pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5) and any sub-totals thereof.",

However, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(3)(ii) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) below for additional discussion regarding the final rule's effective date and related accommodations.",

Also, for clarity, the Bureau has divided this comment into two parts: Final comment 18(c)-8.i explains the summary totals of fees requirement generally and final comment 18(c)-8.ii clarifies the requirements regarding third-party fees. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-8.i explains that a financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.9(b) for a prepaid account must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement, as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, this comment clarifies that, if a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.9(b), fee totals may be disclosed for each statement period rather than each calendar month, if different. This comment also clarifies that the summary totals of fees should be net of any fee reversals.",
                        "Final comment 18(c)-8.ii clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include third-party fees in its summary totals of fees provided pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5). For example, a financial institution must include in the summary totals of fees the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM, but it need not include any fee charged by an ATM operator, with whom the financial institution has no relationship, for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM. Similarly, a financial institution need not include in the summary totals of fees the fee charged by a third-party reload network for the service of adding cash to a prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal.",
                        "The Bureau is also adopting new comment 18(c)-9 to clarify that a financial institution may, but is not required to, also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5). For example, if a financial institution distinguishes optional fees (e.g., custom card design fees) from fees to use the account, in displaying the summary totals of fees, the financial institution may include sub-totals of those fees, provided the financial institution also presents the combined totals of all fees."

All text included in the tables required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii) must be all black or one color type and printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical. The Bureau believed that contrasting colors for the text and the background of the short form and long form disclosures would make it easier for consumers to read the disclosures. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this proposed requirement.",

In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(7)(ii)(A)-1.",

The Bureau has removed the proposed requirement that the background be provided in clear contrast to the type whenever practical because the Bureau does not believe there is a circumstance under which providing a clear contrast would not be practical. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that contrasting colors for the text and the background of the short form and long form disclosures will make it easier for consumers to read and comprehend the disclosure.",
                "New comment 18(b)(7)(ii)(A)-1 explains that a financial institution complies with the color requirements if, for example, it provides the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2), (3)(i) and (ii), and (4) printed in black type on a white background or white type on a black background. While the Bureau continues to believe that using black/white for the text and a contrasting white/black for the background of the disclosures would provide an ideal presentation, it also recognizes that using other similarly dark colors for text with a neutral background color could also provide clear contrast. For example, as noted in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the statement at the top of the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) disclosed in black type on a grey background, if the background of the rest of the short form disclosure is white, could provide a clear contrast that would help alert consumers to that notice. See, e.g., final Model Form A-10(b).",
                "The comment also explains that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), the type and color may differ between the short form disclosure and the long form disclosure provided for a particular prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution may use one font/type style for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use a different font/type style for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program. Similarly, a financial institution may use black type for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use blue type for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program.",

                "Several consumer groups recommended that the long form, as the more comprehensive disclosure, should indicate whether the financial institution offers overdraft or other credit features in connection with that prepaid account program. The Bureau agrees that the long form disclosure, like the short form disclosure, should include an explicit statement as to whether or not the prepaid account offers any overdraft or credit feature because this is key information for consumers to consider in making their purchase and use decisions regarding prepaid accounts. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) above for further discussion of this disclosure requirement generally. While a financial institution offering a prepaid account program with an overdraft credit feature must disclose in the long form any fees that are imposed in connection with the prepaid account pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii), the Bureau believes a more explicit statement regarding the existence or lack of such a feature is also appropriate, as the availability of such a feature may not be obvious depending on the nature of the fees imposed in connection with the overdraft credit feature and where they are imposed (i.e., on the prepaid account or on the covered separate credit feature). Moreover, inclusion of this statement makes the short form and long form disclosures parallel with regard to the disclosure of the existence of such a feature and, if one may be offered, the duration of the waiting period, and that fees would apply.",

Specifically, existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1) currently provides that EFTA and Regulation E govern: (1) The addition to an accepted credit card, as defined in Regulation Z (existing \u00a7\u20091026.12, comment 12-2), of the capability to initiate EFTs; (2) the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions pursuant to an overdraft line of credit (involving a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account), or under an overdraft service (as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)); and (3) the addition of an overdraft service, as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a), to an accepted access device.",

The application of these various provisions to prepaid accounts and revisions to the relevant prongs of existing \u00a7\u20091005.12 are discussed below. The proposal would have amended provisions in existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(ii) so that the rules in TILA and Regulation Z would govern whether a prepaid card could be a credit card when it is issued. Proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h) (renumbered as new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) in the final rule) would have required a credit card issuer to wait at least 30 days from prepaid account registration before opening a credit card account for a holder of a prepaid account, or providing a solicitation or application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit card account that would be accessed by the access device for a prepaid account that is a credit card. Thus, proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h) would have prevented a prepaid card from being a credit card at the time it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h). Under the proposal, because a prepaid card could not have been a credit card at the time it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period discussed above, the issuance of such a prepaid card would have been governed under the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E.",

Existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(ii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions under a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a).",

In contrast, Regulation Z's issuance rules apply if the access device can access another type of credit feature when it is issued; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account. Existing comment 12(a)-2 provides that for access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a).

The Bureau proposed to comment 12(a)-3 to explain that an access device for a prepaid account may not access a credit card account when the access device is issued and would have cross referenced proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h). Under the proposal, because a prepaid card could not have been a credit card when it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h), the issuance of such a prepaid card would have been governed under the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E.",

                        "As discussed above, the proposal would have added comment 12(a)-3 to explain that an access device for a prepaid account may not access a credit card account when the access device is issued and would have cross referenced proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(h). Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is adopting new comment 12(a)-3, with revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. New comment 12(a)-3 provides that an access device for a prepaid account cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 when the access device is issued if the access device is issued prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c). New comment 12(a)-3 also explains that an access device for a prepaid account that is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as that term is defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 is subject to the issuance rules in Regulation E. Because a prepaid access device cannot access a covered separate credit feature that would make the access device into a credit card when the access device is issued if the access device is issued prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c), the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E will apply to the issuance of the prepaid access device that does not access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                        "The issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E apply to those prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards even though the prepaid card accesses the credit feature at the time the prepaid card is issued.",
                        "Addition of a covered separate credit feature to an existing access device for a prepaid account. The Bureau is amending existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(2)(i) as proposed to provide that the issuance rules in TILA and Regulation Z govern the addition of a credit feature or plan to an accepted access device, including an access device for a prepaid account, that would make the access device into a credit card under Regulation Z.",
                        "The proposal would have added comment 12(a)-4 that would have explained that Regulation Z governs the addition of any credit feature or plan to an access device for a prepaid account where the access device also would be a credit card under Regulation Z. Proposed comment 12(a)-4 also would have stated that Regulation Z (existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(20), proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii) would have provided guidance on whether a program constitutes a credit plan, and that Regulation Z (existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i), proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2) would have defined the term credit card and provided examples of cards or devices that are and are not credit cards. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is finalizing new comment 12(a)-4, with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. New comment 12(a)-4 provides that Regulation Z governs the addition of a covered separate credit feature as that term is defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 to an existing access device for a prepaid account. In this case, the access device becomes a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z. A credit card feature may be added to a previously issued access device for a prepaid account only upon the consumer's application or specific request as described in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(a)(1) and only in compliance with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c), as discussed above. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "For the reasons set forth in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section, the Bureau believes that credit card rules in Regulation Z, including the unsolicited issuance rules in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(a), should apply to hybrid prepaid-credit cards that access covered separate credit features. The Bureau believes that the more restrictive issuance rules in Regulation Z for issuance of a credit card are appropriate in this context. As discussed above, consistent with TILA section 132, final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(a) provides that no credit card generally may be issued to any person on an unsolicited basis. This is in contrast to Regulation E which allows an access device to be provided to a consumer on an unsolicited basis if four enumerated situations are met.",
                        "The Bureau believes in particular that the addition of a covered separate credit feature to an accepted prepaid access device that would make the prepaid card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card causes a significant transformation with respect to a prepaid account. The Bureau believes that applying the Regulation Z unsolicited issuance rules to the addition of such a credit feature to a prepaid access device will help ensure that consumers must take affirmative steps to effect such a transformation by permitting financial institutions to link covered separate credit features to prepaid cards only in response to consumers' applications or requests that the credit features be linked. A card issuer also must comply with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) with respect to linking the covered separate credit feature to the prepaid card, as discussed above and in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) below. New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) will help ensure that consumers are fully aware of the implications of their decisions to link covered separate credit features to prepaid cards by prohibiting card issuers from linking a covered separate credit feature to a prepaid card until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered.",
                        "Overdraft credit services defined in \u00a7\u20091005.17. Existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the addition of an overdraft service, as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a), to an accepted access device. Existing comment 12(a)-3 provides that the addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (existing \u00a7\u20091005.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (existing \u00a7\u20091005.17). The proposal would have provided that existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iii) would not have applied to access devices for prepaid accounts. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-3 to proposed comment 12(a)-2 and would have revised it to provide that the comment does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts.",
                        "The final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iii). The final rule moves existing comment 12(a)-3 to new comment 12(a)-2 for organizational purposes, but does not amend the comment as proposed. The Bureau has not adopted the proposed amendments to existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iii) and new comment 12(a)-2 because the Bureau believes such revisions are unnecessary in light of changes in other parts of the rule. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.17 below, the Bureau is adding \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(4) to provide that an overdraft service does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to (1) a credit feature that is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61; or (2) credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account that meets the conditions of new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). Thus, because a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not an overdraft service under final \u00a7\u20091005.17(a), existing \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iii) and new comment 12(a)-2 related to the addition of an overdraft service as defined in final \u00a7\u20091005.17(a) to an access device are not applicable to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card."

Current \u00a7\u20091005.11 generally sets forth the procedures for resolving errors relating to EFTs involving a consumer's account. The Bureau is adding new \u00a7\u20091005.18(e) to set forth a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs and the procedures for investigating errors related to EFTs involving prepaid accounts. See generally the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(e) below.",

Current Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13 generally sets forth error resolution procedures for billing errors that relate to extensions of credit that are made in connection with open-end credit plans or credit card accounts.",
                        "Existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv) currently provides guidance on how the provisions on limits on liability for unauthorized use and the provisions setting forth error resolution procedures under Regulations E and Z apply when credit is extended incident to an EFT. Specifically, current \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv) provides that EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit that occurs pursuant to an overdraft line of credit (under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account), or under an overdraft service, as defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.17(a).",
                        "Current comment 12(a)-1.i provides that for transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not include a debit to a checking account (or other consumer asset account), the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction debits a checking account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction debits a checking account but also draws on an overdraft line of credit attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations apply, in addition to existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the checking account).\n          If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from a checking account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a line of credit that is separate from the checking account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply. Current comment 12(a)-1.ii sets forth examples that illustrate these principles.",

The Bureau also proposed to add \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) to provide that with respect to a prepaid account, EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit, under a credit plan subject to Regulation Z subpart B, that is incident to an EFT when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) that would have applied to credit in connection with a prepaid account was similar but not the same as proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) that would have applied to accounts other than prepaid accounts. Like proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A), proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) generally would have applied Regulation E's limits on liability for unauthorized use and error resolution procedures to transactions that are partially funded through an EFT using an access device and partially funded through credit under a plan that is accessed by an access device when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn.",
                        "However, unlike proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A), proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would not have focused on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Instead, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would have focused on whether credit is extended under a \u201cplan\u201d when the consumer's prepaid account does not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction and the plan is subject to the provisions in Regulation Z subpart B. For example, under the proposal, a credit plan that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card would have been subject to the provisions of subpart B. Under the proposal, a prepaid card would have been a credit card under Regulation Z even if the creditor retains discretion not to pay the credit transactions. Thus, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would have focused on whether credit is extended under an \u201cplan\u201d that is subject to the provisions of subpart B, rather than whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account.",
                        "The proposal would have added comment 12(a)-5.i to provide that for an account other than a prepaid account where credit is extended incident to an EFT under an agreement to extend overdraft credit between the consumer and the financial institution, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions would have applied, in addition to \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). With respect to an account other than a prepaid account, credit that is incident to an EFT that is not extended under an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution where the financial institution agrees to extend credit is governed solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E and Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) do not apply. With respect to a prepaid account where credit is extended under a credit plan that is subject to Regulation Z subpart B, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions would have applied, in addition to Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). In addition, proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided that a credit plan is subject to Regulation Z subpart B if it is accessed by an access device that is a credit card under Regulation Z or if it is open-end credit under Regulation Z. An access device for a prepaid account would not have been a credit card if the access device only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Proposed comment 12(a)-5.i also would have provided that credit incident to an EFT under a credit plan that only can be accessed by an access device for a prepaid account that is not a credit card is not subject to Regulation Z subpart B and is governed solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E because the credit plan would not have accessed by a credit card and the plan would not have been open-end credit. In this case, Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) would not have applied.",

The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.i to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii and made revisions to make clear that this guidance applies to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal.

Specifically, these examples describe different types of transactions that involve a debit card that also is a credit card and discuss whether Regulation E or Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution requirements apply to those transactions. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D to proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D respectively. The proposal also would have revised the examples in proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D to clarify that these examples relate to a credit card that also is an access device that draws on a consumer's checking account, and would have made technical revisions to clarify the intent of the examples. No substantive changes would have been intended with these revisions. The proposal also would have added proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.E that would have provided that the same principles in proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D apply to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal."

As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "As discussed below, the final rule also adds new \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C), and (D), and (2)(iii) to provide guidance on whether Regulation E or Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions made by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61.",
                        "Proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided guidance on the provisions in both proposed \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). As discussed in more detail below, the final rule retains the guidance related to credit extended in connection with prepaid accounts in new comment 12(a)-5.i with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule moves guidance related to other types of credit from proposed comment 12(a)-5.i to new comment 12(a)-5.ii and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also moves current comment 12(a)-1.i and ii to new comment 12(a)-5.iii and iv and revises this comment to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61.",
                        "Consistent with the proposal, with respect to transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, new \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) does not focus on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Under the final rule, whether a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card does not depend on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Instead, under the final rule, a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z when it is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d as defined in Regulation Z. In particular, new Regulation Z comment 61(a)(1)-1 provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the prepaid card can access credit from a covered separate credit feature even if, for example: (1) The person that can extend the credit does not agree in writing to extend the credit; (2) the person retains discretion not to extend the credit; or (3) the person does not extend the credit once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit.",
                        "Thus, consistent with the proposal, new \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) focuses on transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, where an extension of credit that is incident to an EFT occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction. These are the situations in which Regulations Z and E would overlap with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. New \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that in these circumstances, EFTA and Regulation E generally govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to these transactions. Regulation Z's provisions related to a consumer's liability for unauthorized transactions and error resolution procedures generally do not apply, except for existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) that apply to the credit portion of the transaction.",

The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.i to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii and made revisions to make clear that this guidance applies to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal. The proposal also would have made technical revisions to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii for clarity; no substantive changes were intended. The final rule moves current comment 12(a)-1.i to new comment 12(a)-5.iii and adopts this comment consistent with the proposal, with additional technical revisions for clarity. New comment 12(a)-5.iii provides guidance on how the principles in final \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv) apply to transactions involving access devices that are credit cards under Regulation Z, including hybrid prepaid-credit cards that access covered separate credit features. New comment 12(a)-5.iii provides that for transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards under Regulation Z, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not access funds in a consumer asset account, such as a checking account or prepaid account, the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction accesses funds in an asset account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction access funds in an asset account but also involves an extension of credit under an overdraft credit feature subject to Regulation Z attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply, in addition to existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from an asset account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a credit feature that is subject to Regulation Z that is separate from the asset account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.",

No substantive changes are intended with these revisions.

New comment 12(a)-5.iv.E also provides a cross-reference to final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.13(i)(2) and new comment 13(i)-4 that deals with the interaction between Regulations E and Z with respect to billing error resolution for transactions that involve covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.",
                        "Prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                        "As discussed above, the final rule adds new \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C), (D), and (2)(iii) to provide guidance on whether Regulation E or Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions made by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. New \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that Regulation E governs the consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that involves credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). New comment 12(a)-5.i clarifies that \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that with respect to transactions that involves credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), these transactions are governed solely by the liability limitations and error resolution procedures in Regulation E, and Regulation Z does not apply.",
                        "New \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) provides that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, Regulation E governs the consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account, as applicable. New \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(2)(iii) provides that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable. New comment 12(a)-5.i clarifies that \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.",
                        "As discussed above, EFTA section 909(c) provides that EFTA's limits on liability for unauthorized use apply to transactions which involve both an unauthorized EFT and an extension of credit pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn.\n          The Bureau believes, however, that EFTA section 909(c) does not apply to transactions that access a non-covered separate credit feature. Non-covered separate credit features only include overdraft credit features with respect to prepaid accounts provided by unrelated third-party creditors other than the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature could not be offered by a financial institution that is offering overdraft on the prepaid account. For purposes of EFTA section 909(c), the Bureau believes extending credit is reasonably interpreted only to apply where the financial institution is itself the creditor, and thus would not encompass a situation where the financial institution who is the prepaid account issuer would be accessing credit, pursuant to an agreement with the consumer, from the consumer's non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, as explained in new comment 12(a)-5.i, new \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.

Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(1) would have stated that, except as provided in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2), the requirements of EFTA and Regulation E, as modified by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18, would have applied to prepaid accounts nine months following the publication of the Bureau's final rule in the Federal Register.  This would have included the disclosure requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) and (f)(2), and would have applied to prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other physical materials that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise prepared in connection with a prepaid account on or after nine months. Thus, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(1) would have generally made applicable to all prepaid accounts the requirements of EFTA and Regulation E, as modified by the provisions of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18, including those governing disclosures, access to prepaid account information, limited liability and error resolution, among others, after nine months. For instance, the new disclosure requirements would have applied immediately at the nine-month mark for disclosures and other information made available to consumers online or by telephone.",
                        "However, this first proposed effective date would not have required immediate destruction or removal of previously printed materials because it would have only required packages, cards, and other materials printed on or after the nine month date to comply with the rule's disclosure requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) and (f)(2). Instead, the Bureau proposed a delayed effective date for certain additional packaging-related changes, which would have been 12 months following the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  This second date, in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2), would have required full compliance with the rule's disclosure requirements and would have prohibited the offering, sale, or otherwise making available of prepaid accounts and related packaging, access devices, or other printed materials without such disclosures. As a result, by 12 months, financial institutions and their third-party distribution agents would have had to remove from retail store shelves and other distribution channels any prepaid accounts with disclosures not fully in compliance with the rule.",
                        "For prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other printed materials created prior to this first effective date, the Bureau believed that nothing it proposed would trigger requirements under existing Regulation E to provide a change-in-terms notice insofar as the proposal would not have required increased fees, liability, or fewer types of available EFTs for consumers.\n          If, however, financial institutions wished to avail themselves of the more limited error resolution or limited liability requirements for existing unregistered prepaid accounts where their existing terms provide greater protections, the Bureau noted that a change-in-terms notice might be required.",
                        "The Bureau also noted that, independent of the proposed rule, financial institutions that wish to make substantive changes to prepaid account fees or terms are often required by other laws to remove from retail stores and other distribution channels prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other printed materials that their changes render inaccurate, and to provide notice of those changes to consumers with existing prepaid accounts. Such laws may include operative state consumer protection and contract laws."

                        "The Bureau received many comments from industry, including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, payment networks, a payment processor, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, arguing that the proposed nine- and 12-month compliance periods would be insufficient to implement the changes that would be required under the proposal.",
                        "These commenters argued that, due to the perceived complexity of the proposal, industry would need more time to review the requirements of the final rule and implement extensive system and operational changes, which would include, among other things, revising internal procedures and training staff. Commenters recommended a range of time periods, starting at 12 months but generally converging around 18 to 24 months. One trade association, however, said that it found the proposed nine- and 12-month effective dates reasonable. Commenters stated that the rule will affect the entire prepaid industry at the same time and will require coordination and planning among all industry participants, including third-party vendors. They explained that high demand for packaging manufacturers would strain resources and suppliers and cause significant delays in the production process. Industry commenters also expressed concern about the costs and waste associated with pulling and replacing packaging with non-compliant disclosures. These commenters stated that a longer compliance period would ensure that industry has time to comprehensively implement the required changes, with minimal business disruption, and avoid the destruction of millions of card packages. These commenters also urged the Bureau to consider holiday season system freezes and peak time demands when setting an effective date for the final rule, as well as impacts related to the roll-out of EMV-enabled cards and POS terminals. These commenters explained that, as an industry practice, various entities involved in the prepaid value chain observe a \u201cfreeze period\u201d during which no major system updates should take place, often due to increased volumes during certain times of the year. The exact periods may differ for financial institutions, program managers, data processors, and retail stores, but combined generally span October through April.",
                        "Several commenters explained that industry would need more time than the Bureau proposed to implement necessary system and operational changes, in order to comply with specific aspects of the proposal. For example, with respect to disclosures, several commenters stated that the proposed requirements would, among other things, require industry to design new disclosures that would appear on packaging materials, which would need to be newly produced, and on Web sites and mobile applications, which would need to be redesigned and reprogrammed. These commenters explained that providing disclosures prior to the acquisition of government benefit accounts, payroll card accounts, and campus cards would require revisions to current procedures, training of third parties and employees, enhanced monitoring of third-party practices, and the removal and replacement of preprinted card stock. To help mitigate the costs that would be associated with destroying unused packaging material, several credit unions and credit union trade associations urged the Bureau to consider a compliance period driven by the expiration date on the card stock. These commenters explained that some credit unions purchase card stock four years in advance of the last expiration date, as cards are sold with a three-year expiration date range. One industry trade association suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor for any prepaid account packaging manufactured in the ordinary course of business within 90 days of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  Another industry trade association suggested that the Bureau grant an exemption for cards issued before a certain date, allow financial institutions to exhaust the card stock and notify consumers in a reasonable manner that additional rights apply to the existing cards, or impose a \u201cmanufacture date\u201d after which all cards manufactured must comply with the final rule. A payment network suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor and allow financial institutions to keep existing physical cards stocked at retail locations and notify consumers of any changes either by sending change-in-terms notices or by obtaining consumer consent upon registration. This commenter added that this approach would both cure outdated pricing on card packaging and also allow financial institutions to introduce new features that have a fee.",
                        "Regarding the proposed access to account information requirements, several commenters stated that displaying the proposed summary totals of fees, deposits, and debits for the prior calendar month and the calendar year to date in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4) would require financial institutions to map the fee information for each cardholder, redesign online transaction history pages, and change the formatting for paper statements. With respect to the proposed requirement to provide 18 months of account transaction history under the periodic statement alternative in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), several industry commenters stated that making the changes necessary to provide 18 months of account history nine months after publication of the final rule would be problematic and time-consuming. These commenters explained that financial institutions may not currently have 18 months of account transaction history for prepaid accounts and, if they do, older information is likely archived and not easily accessible. These commenters also explained that financial institutions would need to redesign systems to be capable of supporting 18 months of account transaction history and would need to train staff on the new systems and capabilities.",
                        "Several commenters stated that submitting prepaid account agreements to the Bureau and posting agreements on the issuer's Web site pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and (c), respectively, would require financial institutions to create a process for updating agreements on a quarterly basis, develop a periodic monitoring process to ensure accuracy of these agreements, create a location on their Web sites for the posting of agreements, and develop a process for maintaining inventory of these agreements.",
                        "Regarding the proposed changes to the treatment of overdraft services and certain other credit plans for prepaid accounts, several industry commenters explained that, to avoid coverage under the rule as proposed for inadvertent overdrafts such as those resulting from force pay transactions, financial institutions would either need to block authorization requests where the final transaction amount is not known in advance (such as gasoline purchases at automated fuel dispensers) and require cardholders to pay in advance for every transaction that could potentially result in an inadvertent overdraft, or add transaction audit steps for merchant-initiated transactions to ensure that merchants have a current, accurate authorization before any prepaid card transaction is processed. One program manager that currently offers overdraft services on some of its prepaid accounts requested a compliance period of at least 24 months to develop and test new systems for delivering the required disclosures (e.g., periodic statements for prepaid cards that are also deemed a credit card) and to perform underwriting for complying with ability-to-pay requirements under Regulation Z. For existing prepaid accounts that offer overdraft services, this commenter urged the Bureau to establish at least a 6-month period during which overdraft services could continue to be offered without being subject to the final rule, so that consumers could be given sufficient notice regarding the changes to allow them to make alternative financial arrangements as necessary. This commenter explained, however, that if the Bureau established an effective date for a period longer than nine months (such as 24 months), the 6-month wind-down period would be less important.",
                        "Several commenters suggested modifications to the proposed effective dates that they believed would reduce the potential compliance burden on industry. A few industry commenters suggested a longer compliance period for products sold at retail and for portions of the rule that require system changes. One payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers urged the Bureau to allow consumers to continue using their existing prepaid cards until the card expires, which the payment network believed would allow financial institutions to avoid destroying millions of cards consistent with the spirit of what is commonly referred to as the \u201cECO Card Act.\u201d\u2009\n          For existing vendor contracts that may be in violation of the final rule, one state employment department and an industry commenter urged the Bureau to either grandfather in existing contracts until they expire, or provide a reasonable timeframe in which to amend or rebid the contracts. One industry commenter requested that the final rule clearly state when revisions to Regulation Z will become effective to avoid confusion for financial institutions that are also subject to 32 CFR part 232, the regulation implementing the MLA,\n          which the DOD proposed shortly before the Bureau released its proposed rulemaking on prepaid accounts.",
                        "The Bureau received few comments from consumer groups regarding this portion of the proposal. One consumer group suggested that the Bureau could allow financial institutions to implement the access to account information requirements set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c) on a rolling basis. This commenter explained that under such scenario, a financial institution would not be required to provide account information from prior to the final rule's effective date, but instead could begin accumulating it on the effective date until the financial institution has the information needed for the full time periods required by the rule."

The Bureau believes it is important to ensure that industry has sufficient time to implement the changes required by this final rule, but it is also important not to delay the important consumer protections the rule sets forth any longer than necessary. The Bureau has thus extended the general effective date of this final rule from the proposed nine months following the publication of the rule in the Federal Register to approximately 12 months following issuance of the final rule. The Bureau has also made a number of modifications and accommodations in the rule to address particular concerns raised by commenters.",
                        "Specifically, the Bureau's final rule on prepaid accounts, as set forth herein, will generally become effective on October 1, 2017, with a few exceptions as discussed below. Under this final rule (unlike the proposal), financial institutions are not required to pull and replace prepaid account access devices and packaging materials with non-compliant disclosures that were produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017. The final rule also includes specific provisions addressing how financial institutions should provide notices of changes and updated initial disclosures in certain circumstances. Further, this final rule includes an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily available the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) or the summary totals of fees requirement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5) as of October 1, 2017. In addition, the requirement to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) is delayed until October 1, 2017.",
                        "The Bureau has included several provisions in regulatory text and commentary to make clearer these specific modifications to the rule's general October 1, 2017 effective date. Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) establishes a general effective date as well as special transition rules for certain disclosure provisions. The delayed effective date for submission of prepaid account agreements to the Bureau is addressed in \u00a7\u20091005.19(f).",
                        "The Bureau notes that nothing in this final rule changes the existing requirements for payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts prior to October 1, 2017. Financial institutions offering payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts must comply with all existing requirements applicable to those accounts under EFTA and Regulation E until October 1, 2017. Beginning October 1, 2017, financial institutions must comply with modified requirements in subpart A of Regulation E for such accounts as set forth in this final rule.",

Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(i) establishes an exception for non-compliant disclosures on existing prepaid account access devices and packaging materials to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement. In return, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) requires that financial institutions provide notices of certain changes and updated initial disclosures to consumers who acquire prepaid accounts on or after October 1, 2017 via non-compliant packaging materials printed prior to the effective date. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) clarifies the requirements for providing notice of changes to consumers who acquired prepaid accounts before October 1, 2017. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv) facilitates the delivery of the notices of changes and updated initial disclosures for prepaid accounts governed by \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). Finally, \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(3) sets forth the accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative or summary totals of fees requirements.

                        "The Bureau believes 12 months is an appropriate compliance period for this final rule in general, particularly given the modifications and accommodations discussed below, and should provide financial institutions sufficient time to review the requirements of the final rule, implement the necessary system and operational changes, and for coordination and planning among all industry participants. The Bureau has specified an October 1, 2017 effective date for the final rule in general, rather than making it contingent on publication of the final rule in the Federal Register,  for several reasons. The Bureau believes an October 1, 2017 effective date will not interfere with holiday season system freezes and peak time demands, which commenters stated generally spans October through April, and setting a date certain in this context will provide more clarity and comfort to industry in this regard. (In response to related concerns raised by commenters, the Bureau believes that, given the modification to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement, and given that the liability shift for EMV cards took place in late 2015, the impact regarding the roll-out of EMV-enabled cards will be minimal, if at all.) In addition, the Bureau has included in regulatory text and commentary several detailed provisions and examples involving dates that it believes will be easier for industry to understand if a particular effective date is specified.\n          Finally, with respect to the Regulation Z portion of this final rule, TILA section 105(d) generally provides that a regulation requiring any disclosure that differs from the disclosures previously required by parts A, D, or E of TILA \u201cshall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows at least six months the date of promulgation.\u201d\u2009",

With respect to an industry commenter's request to continue overdraft services for six months after the effective date without being subject to the final rule in order to inform consumers of changes to those services, the Bureau believes the overall change to a 12-month effective date should provide sufficient time to provide such notice to consumers. The Bureau does not believe any further modifications or extensions to the effective date are necessary or appropriate. Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to handle inadvertent overdrafts such as those resulting from force pay transactions, the Bureau has generally excluded such transactions from coverage under Regulation Z.",
                        "Regarding commenters' request to grandfather in or provide a timeframe to amend or rebid existing vendor contracts, the Bureau does not believe this is necessary and thus declines to do so; however, the Bureau believes the modification to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement for preprinted packaging materials will help ameliorate commenters' concerns until new contracts can be executed.",
                        "The Bureau believes a 12-month compliance period is sufficient for financial institutions to make system and operational changes to comply with this final rule, especially given the modifications and accommodations discussed herein. Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to design new disclosures, the Bureau is providing native design files (for print disclosures) and source code (for web-based disclosures) for all of the model and sample disclosures forms included in the final rule to aid in their development.\n          The Bureau is also committed to working with industry to help address and alleviate burden through regulatory implementation support and guidance.\n          With respect to commenters' concern about the time needed to change the process for providing disclosures prior to the acquisition of government benefit accounts, payroll card accounts, and campus cards, the final rule specifically clarifies the timing of acquisition requirements in final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 for payroll card accounts and prepaid accounts generally, and in final comments 15(c)-1 and -2 for government benefit accounts. These revisions are consistent with the current practices of many employers and government agencies and therefore should not necessitate significant modifications to current procedures. See the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i) and 1005.15(c) for additional information regarding the timing for delivery of pre-acquisition disclosures.",
                        "Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to implement changes to comply with the periodic statement alternative in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) and the summary totals of fees requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5), the Bureau believes the modifications made to those provisions should aid industry in coming into compliance with those requirements. Specifically, the Bureau has modified \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) to require at least 12 months of electronic account transaction history, which commenters stated many financial institutions already make available, and therefore any changes needed to comply with that portion of the rule should be minimal. Likewise, providing at least 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) should have minimal impact on existing business processes because many financial institutions currently archive several years of account information.\n          Moreover, the Bureau has modified \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(4), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(5), to require financial institutions to provide the summary totals of fees only and has removed the proposed requirement to provide summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a consumer's prepaid account. The Bureau also believes the accommodation set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(3) for financial institutions that do not have readily available the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative or summary totals of fees requirements as of the effective date should provide financial institutions the time needed to comply with the final rule. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c) for additional information regarding the periodic statement alternative and the summary totals of fees requirement.",
                        "The Bureau has also made several revisions to address commenters' concerns regarding the time needed to comply with the requirements to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and to post agreements on the issuer's Web site pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c). With respect to the submission requirement, the final rule sets forth a delayed effective date in final \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2), which will provide issuers the time needed to develop and implement their own internal processes and procedures for submitting agreements to the Bureau. Regarding the posting requirement, the Bureau believes the modification in final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) to require issuers to post on their Web sites only agreements that are offered to the general public will reduce the number of agreements at least some issuers must post and therefore should decrease the amount of time needed to comply with this requirement relative to the proposal. In addition, the Bureau believes many issuers already post these agreements to their Web sites. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19 for additional information about the prepaid account agreement submission and posting requirements and the related effective dates.",
                        "18(h)(2)(i). Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(i) establishes an exception for non-compliant disclosures on existing prepaid account access devices and packaging materials. Specifically, it provides that the disclosure requirements of subpart A of Regulation E, as modified by final \u00a7\u20091005.18, shall not apply to any disclosures that are provided, or that would otherwise be required to be provided, on prepaid account access devices, or on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017.",
                        "The Bureau is not adopting the proposed requirement that financial institutions and their third-party distribution agents remove from retail store shelves and other distribution channels any prepaid accounts with disclosures not fully in compliance with the final rule as of the effective date. Thus, financial institutions are not required to pull and replace prepaid account access devices and packaging materials that do not contain new disclosures required by this final rule (such as the short form disclosure) or that contain disclosures that are no longer accurate as a result of this final rule (such as a disclosure stating that at least 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history are available under the periodic statement alternative, rather than 12 and 24 months of history, respectively, as required by this final rule). Likewise, financial institutions are not required to retrieve from consumers prepaid account access devices, such as prepaid cards, that were distributed prior to the effective date. The Bureau believes this modification will help to reduce the demand on packaging manufacturers, which commenters stated would have strained resources and caused delays in the production process, and will also mitigate the waste that would have been associated with pulling and replacing packaging with non-compliant disclosures. Financial institutions are not required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) prior to October 1, 2017.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(h)-1 to explain that the October 1, 2017 effective date applies to disclosures made available or provided to consumers electronically, orally by telephone, or in a form other than on pre-printed materials, such as disclosures printed on paper by a financial institution upon a consumer's request. In addition, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(h)-2 to provide examples of disclosures that would fall under the exception set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(i) and to make clear that disclosures and access devices that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced on or after October 1, 2017 must comply with all the requirements of subpart A of Regulation E.",
                        "18(h)(2)(ii). Because the final rule does not require financial institutions to pull and replace packaging materials manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced before October 1, 2017, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require financial institutions to provide a notice of certain changes and updated initial disclosures to consumers who acquire prepaid accounts on or after October 1, 2017 via such non-compliant packaging materials. Specifically, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A) requires that, if a financial institution has changed a prepaid account's terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect such that a change-in-terms notice would have been required under \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) or \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2) for existing customers, the financial institution must provide to the consumer a notice of the change within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. Separately, \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B) requires that the financial institution mail or deliver to the consumer initial disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7 and \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1) that have been updated as a result of this final rule taking effect, within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. The Bureau notes that financial institutions must mail or deliver initial disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B) even if \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A) does not apply.",
                        "Because of changes made in the final rule relative to the proposal, the Bureau believes that it is even less likely that financial institutions will make broad changes to their prepaid programs as a result of the final rule taking effect of the kind that would trigger requirements to provide a change-in-terms notice to existing customers under \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) or \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2). Those rules require that existing customers be provided with an advance notice in writing only for changes that would result for the consumer in increased fees, increased liability, fewer types of available EFTs, or stricter limitations on the frequency or dollar amount of transfers. For instance, because the final rule requires that Regulation E limited liability and error resolution requirements apply to all accounts, even if they are not registered or verified, the Bureau no longer anticipates that financial institutions would be making changes to their account agreements that would increase liability for consumers. However, based on comments the Bureau received from industry, the Bureau is aware that some financial institutions anticipate discontinuing an available EFT service as it is currently offered as a result of the final rule taking effect, in that the new requirements imposed on overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts would require certain program restructuring in ways that may affect availability in certain circumstances or for certain consumers.",
                        "In light of these circumstances, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to impose a requirement (in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A)) on financial institutions that is parallel to the spirit of Regulation E change-in-terms requirements to notify consumers who acquire a prepaid account after the effective date of the final rule via non-compliant packaging if such changes to the prepaid account's terms and conditions are being made as a result of the rule taking effect. Accordingly, \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) requires such notice to be provided, via the method specified in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv), within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information.",
                        "While the Bureau believes that changes to existing programs' terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect that would trigger change-in-terms requirements under Regulation E for existing customers will be rare, the Bureau expects that financial institutions will make other types of changes to their initial disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.7 and 1005.18(f)(1) in response to this final rule. Accordingly, in light of the decision not to require that outdated packaging be pulled and replaced, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require (in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B)) that consumers who acquire a prepaid account with packaging that was printed prior to the effective date receive updated initial disclosures that accurately describe the account's terms, conditions, and related information as required under the final rule.",
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) and 905(a), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that the notices required pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account. In addition, consistent with EFTA sections 904 and 905(a), the Bureau believes the updated initial disclosures will help consumers understand the new terms of their prepaid accounts, as authorized under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to effectuate the purposes of EFTA.",
                        "Because financial institutions generally mail to consumers a personalized prepaid card embossed with the consumer's name, and other informational materials, after the account is registered, the Bureau believes that requiring financial institutions to include a notice of the applicable changes to the prepaid account's terms and conditions and the updated initial disclosures in that mailing will impose very little burden on industry. Further, as discussed under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, a financial institution is permitted to deliver the notice and disclosures electronically, without regard to E-Sign consent, if it is not otherwise already mailing or delivering to the consumer written account-related communications within the time periods specified in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii). The Bureau believes that the combined effect of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(i) and (ii) will help reduce compliance burden on industry relative to the proposal, while still providing appropriate transparency to consumers.",
                        "18(h)(2)(iii). The Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) to specify and balance burden concerns with respect to providing notices of changes to prepaid accounts' terms and conditions to consumers who acquired prepaid accounts before October 1, 2017. As with \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) discussed above, the Bureau recognizes that some financial institutions may make changes to prepaid account terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect that would otherwise require a change-in-terms notice under Regulation E, in that the new requirements imposed on overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts would require certain program restructuring in ways that may affect availability in certain circumstances or to certain consumers. The Bureau believes that financial institutions that offer such features typically require consumers to consent to delivery of electronic disclosures pursuant to the E-Sign Act before any credit is extended, but there may be other consumers with prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program who have never sought to activate that feature on their prepaid accounts and who have not specifically consented to electronic delivery.",
                        "In light of these unusual circumstances and other considerations with regard to general implementation of the final rule, the Bureau believes that financial institutions may choose to effectuate such changes in terms as of October 1, 2017, or may want to do so earlier depending on operational convenience. New \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii), which applies to prepaid accounts acquired by consumers before October 1, 2017, is designed to address both scenarios. Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution has changed a prepaid accounts' terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect such that a change-in-terms notice would have been required under \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) or \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2) for existing customers, the financial institution must provide to the consumer a notice of the change at least 21 days in advance of the change becoming effective, provided the financial institution has the consumer's contact information. If the financial institution obtains the consumer's contact information less than 30 days in advance of the change becoming effective or after it has become effective, the financial institution is permitted instead to notify the consumer of the change in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A). The financial institution is not required to send a change-in-terms notice for such change pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) or \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2). As discussed under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, a financial institution may provide the notice pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) in electronic form without regard to the consumer notice and consent requirements of section 101(c) of the E-Sign Act in certain circumstances.",
                        "The Bureau believes this special notice requirement provides appropriate flexibility to financial institutions in informing consumers with regard to changes to their accounts as a result of the final rule taking effect. The Bureau emphasizes, however, that all changes to a prepaid account's terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect must nevertheless become effective by October 1, 2017. That is, if a financial institution were to provide to a consumer a notice of a change that is subject to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) on September 20, the change must nonetheless become effective by October 1; a financial institution is not permitted to delay the effective date of such a change until October 11 (i.e., 21 days after the financial institution notified the consumer).",
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. EFTA section 905(b) requires financial institutions to notify consumers in writing at least 21 days prior to the effective date of any change in any term or condition of the consumer's account if such change would result in greater cost or liability for such consumer or decreased access to the consumer's account. Because of the unique circumstances involved in effectuating the final rule particularly with regard to consumers who have never sought to activate a credit or overdraft feature in conjunction with a prepaid account and consumers who may be acquiring prepaid accounts close to the date that certain services are discontinued or restricted, the Bureau is exempting financial institutions in this limited circumstance from complying with the change-in-terms notice requirements in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) and \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2). Instead, financial institutions must notify consumers of the change, using the method specified in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv), 21 days in advance of the change taking effect or, in some circumstances, within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. Pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Bureau believes that exemption from the change-in-terms notice requirement is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers and to facilitate compliance, by assisting consumers' understanding of the new terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts that are purchased in outdated packaging. In addition, the Bureau believes that the notice to consumers regarding changes to terms and conditions pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.",
                        "Although the Bureau did not propose, nor is it finalizing, a requirement that financial institutions to provide updated initial disclosures to all consumers who opened prepaid accounts prior to the effective date of this final rule, the Bureau notes that it believes it would nonetheless be beneficial for financial institutions to provide updated initial disclosures to existing customers so that they will understand their rights under the new regime and to avoid potential consumer confusion. Accordingly, as discussed in connection with \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, the Bureau has provided a special rule to facilitate delivery of such communications.",

Specifically, it provides that for these accounts, if a financial institution has not obtained a consumer's consent to provide disclosures in electronic form pursuant to the E-Sign Act, or is not otherwise already mailing or delivering to the consumer written account-related communications within the respective time periods specified in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii), the financial institution may provide to the consumer a notice of a change in terms and conditions pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii) or required or voluntary updated initial disclosures as a result of this final rule taking effect in electronic form without regard to the consumer notice and consent requirements of section 101(c) of the E-Sign Act.",

In addition, the Bureau believes specific provisions are necessary to address how financial institutions should provide notices of certain changes to prepaid account terms and conditions and updated initial disclosures for prepaid accounts that are acquired via outdated packaging. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions will be able to send the notices and disclosures pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) at the same time it sends an embossed card following account registration, and therefore there should be little additional burden. For existing customers from whom the financial institution has not already obtained consent to receive disclosures electronically pursuant to the E-Sign Act, or for customers to whom the financial institution is not otherwise mailing or delivering written account-related communications during the relevant time period, the Bureau believes that permitting electronic delivery of notices of changes in terms and conditions pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii) or required or voluntary updated initial disclosures as a result of this final rule taking effect will minimize compliance burden while still facilitating consumers' understanding of the new terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts in a timely way. Accordingly, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iv) addresses delivery of voluntary disclosures as well as disclosures that are specifically required under final rule \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) in order to incentivize and facilitate such communications.",

However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must comply with the applicable portions of those provisions within 30 days of the account becoming active again in order to avail itself of the timing requirements and accommodations set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(2)(iii) and (iv).",

If, on November 1, 2019, the consumer made another request for written account transaction history, the financial institution would be required to provide three months of account history. The financial institution must continue provide as much account history as it has accumulated at the time of a consumer's request until it has accumulated 24 months of account history. Thus, all financial institutions must fully comply with the electronic account transaction history requirement set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) no later October 1, 2017 and must fully comply with the written account transaction history requirement set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) no later October 1, 2017.",

Two trade association commenters representing banks stated that the proposed definition of \u201cprepaid account\u201d should be modified to expressly include accounts funded or capable of being funded with virtual currencies and submitted a definition of virtual currency they urged the Bureau to adopt. They asserted that virtual currencies are \u201cfunds\u201d under EFTA, and coverage is needed to ensure consumers get the kind of protections they would have if they used other comparable but closely regulated traditional payment systems and products. They further asserted that virtual currency products and systems pose greater risks to consumers than traditional payment products and systems funded with fiat currency.",
                        "These trade association commenters further asserted their belief that, with few exceptions, regulating prepaid accounts funded in virtual currencies would be consistent with the Bureau's goal of providing comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid products. With respect to the exceptions, the commenters suggested that it was unnecessary to regulate virtual currencies that can only be used (1) at a specific merchant or defined group of affiliated merchants; (2) within online gaming platforms with no market or application outside of those platforms; or (3) as part of a customer affinity or rewards program. They asserted that their suggested carve outs are similar to the proposed exclusions for certain store gift cards and for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, in the proposed definition of prepaid account.",
                        "On the other hand, a diverse group of industry commenters and a non-governmental virtual currency policy organization commenter urged the Bureau to expressly provide in the final rule that it does not apply to virtual currency products and services. Commenters expressed concern that regulation would be premature, thus potentially stifling innovation. Several commenters highlighted the low rate of consumer adoption of virtual currency products and services. Commenters also asserted that the Bureau has not adequately studied the virtual currency industry, and that regulations developed for GPR cards are unsuitable to apply to virtual currency products and services because of the differences between such products and services and GPR cards.",

However, neither commenter supported regulating virtual currency products and services in the context of the prepaid rulemaking. The law firm commenter asserted that it was premature to regulate virtual currency products and services, and that adopting regulations to apply to virtual currency products and services would impose significant regulatory burden on such products and services and also stifle innovation. It further suggested that the Bureau adopt the approach the Board took with respect to the regulation of prepaid cards generally. It asserted that despite the Board's decision to not extend the coverage of its Payroll Card Rule to GPR cards, issuers of GPR cards have nonetheless applied consumer protection comparable to those established in that rule. The trade association commenter asserted that the Bureau should address virtual currencies in a separate rulemaking.",
                        "Consumer group commenters generally urged the Bureau to regulate those virtual currency products and services that are used by or marketed to consumers. Specifically, two consumer group commenters stated that the Bureau was right to develop rules that, they believed, anticipated the increasing role of virtual currencies. One urged the Bureau to extend the definition of account to include virtual currency wallets, stating that such extension would be appropriate because it is important for consumer protection rules to be in place before consumer adoption of such wallets becomes widespread, and the application of Regulation E to virtual currency wallets could incent virtual currency wallet providers to ensure that the funds consumers put into virtual currency wallets are adequately protected (to the extent they are not already doing so). Another consumer group commenter asserted that as long as virtual currencies are used for consumer purposes, consumers need protection. It observed that current virtual currency systems lack such protections and highlighted the lack of protection in the areas of limited liability, dispute rights, and error resolution. However, one consumer group commenter opposed regulating virtual currency products and services as prepaid accounts. The commenter stated that it did not believe that accounts that convert fiat money into stored value in a form that is not fiat currency should be classified as prepaid accounts, because the funds in those accounts would be protected once they are converted back into fiat currency.",
                        "As discussed above, the Bureau stated in the proposal that the Bureau's analysis is ongoing with respect to virtual currencies and related products and services. The proposed rule did not resolve specific issues with respect to the application of either existing regulations or the proposed rule to virtual currencies and related products and services. Accordingly, although the Bureau received some comments addressing virtual currency products and services, the Bureau reiterates that application of Regulation E and this final rule to such products and services is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Bureau notes that as part of its broader administration and enforcement of the enumerated consumer financial protection statutes and title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau continues to analyze the nature of products or services tied to virtual currencies."

In particular, \u00a7\u20091005.20 contains provisions applicable to gift certificates, store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards.\n          For those products marketed and sold as gift cards (and that meet certain other qualifications), the Gift Card Rule requires certain disclosures, limits the imposition of certain fees, and contains other restrictions. The Gift Card Rule is distinct from the rest of subpart A of Regulation E, however, and does not provide consumers who use gift cards with the other substantive protections of Regulation E, such as limited liability and error resolution protections, or periodic statements. The Gift Card Rule in \u00a7\u20091005.20(b)(2) expressly excludes those general-use prepaid cards that are reloadable and not marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, while including general-use prepaid cards that are not reloadable as well as those that are marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. The Bureau proposed to add \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(C), which would have provided that a prepaid account was not a gift certificate as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(1) and (b); a store gift card as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(2) and (b); a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(4) and (b); or a general-use prepaid card as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(3) and (b) that is both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.",
                        "The Bureau believed that having to apply both the existing gift card regulatory requirements and the proposed prepaid account requirements could adversely impact the gift card market. The Bureau further expressed concern that if the requirements of the proposed rule were applied to gift cards, it was possible that those requirements, in the context of the typical gift card, could confuse consumers. Relatedly, the Bureau noted that, because most gift cards are not reloadable, not usable at ATMs, and not open loop, consumers were less likely to use gift cards as transaction account substitutes. Finally, the Bureau was concerned that, were it to impose provisions for access to account information and error resolution, and create limits on consumers' liability for unauthorized EFTs, the cost structure of gift cards could change dramatically, since, unlike other types of prepaid products, many gift cards do not typically offer these protections. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the exemption in the Gift Card Rule for general-use prepaid cards applies to products that are reloadable and not marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates.",
                        "By contrast, the Bureau proposed to exclude from the definition of prepaid account only such general-use prepaid products that were both marketed and labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. The Bureau was concerned that, absent this approach, some products it intended to cover in the proposal may be inadvertently excluded due to occasional or incidental marketing activities. For example, comment 20(b)(2)-2 describes, in part, a network-branded GPR card that is principally advertised as a less-costly alternative to a bank account but is promoted in a television, radio, newspaper, or internet advertisement, or on signage as \u201cthe perfect gift\u201d during the holiday season. For purposes of the Gift Card Rule, such a product would be considered marketed as a gift card or gift certificate because of this occasional holiday marketing activity. For purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(C), however, such a product would not have been considered to be both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and thus would have been covered by the proposed definition of prepaid account. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-9 would have explained this distinction."

Two trade association commenters urged the Bureau to expand the exclusion to also cover rebate or refund cards used by retailers or other businesses as part of their merchandise return or reimbursement programs. In addition, a program manager and a payment network objected to the Bureau's decision to exclude only those GPR products that were both marketed and labeled as gift cards. These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude any prepaid product that was subject to the Gift Card Rule, regardless of how it was marketed or labeled. They argued that any card subject to the Gift Card Rule was likely to be limited in function and therefore did not warrant coverage by a rule aimed at protecting transaction account substitutes. In the same vein, they argued that the burden of complying with the proposal would far outweigh the benefit to consumers for these products, and could effectively remove these products from the marketplace. In addition, the payment network noted that the fact that some prepaid products could be subject to both the proposal and the Gift Card Rule could confuse consumers and create regulatory ambiguity for industry.",

One group urged the Bureau to cover network-branded, open-loop reloadable gift cards loaded with at least $500, while the other urged the Bureau to cover reloadable gift cards with a balance of at least $250, each arguing that a card that is loaded with more than those amounts poses a higher consumer risk associated with unauthorized transactions."

Gift certificates and gift cards do not meet the Bureau's definition of prepaid accounts, as they typically cannot be used with multiple, unaffiliated merchants. With regard to general-use prepaid cards that are both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to finalize this exclusion pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers.",
                        "After consideration of the comments, the Bureau remains convinced that subjecting this general category of products to both the Gift Card Rule and the requirements of this final rule would place a significant burden on industry without a corresponding consumer benefit. On the other hand, the Bureau continues to believe that the gift card exclusion should not extend to products that consumers may use as or confuse with transaction account substitutes, even if such products are also covered by the Gift Card Rule. To illustrate, the Bureau understands that some consumers may use multiple non-reloadable cards as transaction accounts to pay important household expenses like utilities and groceries, spending them down and discarding them when the funds are depleted. These cards may be subject to the Gift Card Rule because they are not reloadable and thus do not qualify for the GPR card exclusion in \u00a7\u20091005.20(b)(2). However, if these cards are not labeled or marketed as gift cards, it is possible that consumers will unwittingly acquire these cards thinking that they carry the same protections as other prepaid accounts under this final rule. As previously stated, the Bureau believes consumers who use non-reloadable prepaid products in this way deserve the same protections as consumers who use GPR cards. Further, the Bureau believes that consumers generally understand the protections associated with, and limitations of, gift cards to the extent they are labeled as such. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to expand the proposed exclusion for accounts that are both marketed and labeled as gift cards to accounts that are labeled or marketed as gift cards, as some industry commenters suggested. The Bureau notes that in the gift card provisions of the Credit CARD Act, Congress expressly granted to the Board (now to the Bureau) authority to determine the extent to which the individual definitions and provisions of EFTA or Regulation E should apply to general-use prepaid cards, gift certificates, and store gift cards.",
                        "The Bureau has considered the comments asserting that coverage under both the Prepaid and Gift Card Rules will cause consumer confusion and regulatory ambiguity. However, the Bureau understands that, currently, prepaid issuers consciously avoid marketing and labeling their products in such a way as would cause such products to be covered under the Gift Card Rule. As such, the Bureau believes that, in practice, very few products that are subject to the Gift Card Rule will also qualify as prepaid accounts under this final rule.",
                        "Finally, the Bureau declines to expressly expand the exclusion for accounts that are both marketed and labeled as gift cards to rebate cards, as two commenters suggested. The Bureau believes such an express exclusion would be unnecessary, since such programs are generally excluded from the rule under the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(4) and (b). Existing comment 20(a)(4)-1.iii lists rebate programs operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that can be redeemed for goods or services."

The Bureau proposed to add a cross-reference to \u00a7\u20091005.5(b) (regarding unsolicited issuance of access devices) in comment 18(a)-1 and to add additional guidance that would have explained that a consumer was deemed to request an access device for a prepaid account when, for example, the consumer acquired a prepaid account offered for sale at a retail store or acquired a prepaid account by making a request or submitting an application by telephone or online. The Bureau also proposed to revise existing comment 18(a)-2 regarding application of Regulation E to employers and services providers to refer to prepaid accounts in addition to payroll card accounts, but otherwise the proposal would have left current comment 18(a)-2 unchanged.",
                "One program manager commenter asked the Bureau to clarify in existing comment 18(a)-1 that the distribution of an un-activated payroll card to a new employee did not constitute unsolicited issuance of a payroll card account. A number of other industry commenters, including a trade association and two issuing banks, requested that the Bureau make the same clarification with respect to other account types, including disaster relief cards and student ID cards that also function as prepaid accounts. With respect to the first comment, the Bureau did not intend the proposal to alter the application of \u00a7\u20091005.5 to payroll card accounts, nor is this final rule making such a change. As such, the Bureau declines to revise comment 18(a)-1 in the final rule to change the existing guidance with respect to when a consumer solicits a payroll card account.",
                "With respect to the request for similar clarification regarding other types of cards, the Bureau does not believe that such a clarification is warranted.\n        The Bureau understands from the comments received that most issuers of student prepaid accounts already comply with most, if not all, of the requirements of existing \u00a7\u20091005.5(b) with respect to such cards. Specifically, the Bureau understands that, when students receive access devices they did not specifically request, the devices are inactive and need to be validated before they can be used to access a prepaid account; further, the Bureau understands the devices already come accompanied by most, if not all, of the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7. The Bureau believes that the remaining requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.5(b)\u2014that the access devices be accompanied by an explanation that it is not validated, as well as an explanation of how the consumer may dispose of the card\u2014should not place an additional ongoing burden on issuers of student prepaid accounts.\n        At the same time, the Bureau is aware of reports of students incurring \u201cconfusing\u201d or \u201cunreasonably high fees\u201d for using their student cards.\n        The Bureau believes that, consistent with \u00a7\u20091005.5(b), students who receive ID cards with a prepaid functionality they did not request should know that they are receiving a financial product, and should be aware that they have the right to decline that product's functionality if they so wish.",
                "In sum, the Bureau believes there are significant consumer protection benefits in requiring student ID cards with prepaid functionality to comply with the unsolicited issuance provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.5(b), even in light of any the potential burden to industry. The Bureau therefore declines to add an exception to the unsolicited issuance provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.5(b) for student ID cards, and, likewise, is not adopting any additional guidance with respect to when a student ID card is distributed on an unsolicited basis in \u00a7\u20091005.18.

                "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(iv) would have addressed prepaid products established in connection with certain health care and employee benefit programs. Specifically, the proposed provision would have stated that the term prepaid account did not include a health savings account, flexible spending account, medical savings account, or a health reimbursement arrangement. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(iv)-1 would have defined these terms by referencing existing provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to define \u201chealth savings account\u201d as a health savings account as defined in 26 U.S.C. 223(d); \u201cflexible spending account\u201d as a cafeteria plan which provides health benefits or a health flexible spending arrangement pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 125; \u201cmedical savings account\u201d as an Archer MSA as defined in 26 U.S.C. 220(d); and \u201chealth reimbursement arrangement\u201d as a health reimbursement arrangement which is treated as employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 106.",
                "The Bureau believed that, while these health care and employee benefit accounts could, in some ways, be similar to other types of prepaid accounts, coverage under Regulation E was not necessary at this time. Specifically, the Bureau noted that these products typically come with limits on the amount of funds that could be loaded on to them, the methods for loading, and numerous restrictions on where, when, and how those funds could be spent.",
                "The Bureau received several comments in response to this aspect of the proposal. Several consumer groups opposed the exclusion, noting that the accounts at issue can hold large amounts of money that consumers use over long periods of time. These commenters noted further that these types of accounts especially warrant error resolution protections since\u2014according to the commenters\u2014healthcare billing is notoriously error-prone. In addition, these commenters asserted that compliance should not be overly burdensome for issuers of these types of accounts, since many of the underlying benefit programs already provide consumers with error resolution protections.",
                "By contrast, industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations representing both financial institutions and employers, a payment network, and a program manager, expressed support for the proposed exclusions, and urged the Bureau to expand them further to include additional categories of similar employer-sponsored compensation programs. Specifically, several commenters urged the Bureau to add exclusions for accounts used to disburse parking, transit, dependent care, and wellness benefits. They argued that these programs are similar in several key respects to the types of programs the Bureau excluded from the definition of prepaid account in the proposal. For example, they explained that these accounts are typically funded from the employer's general assets, not by consumers, and as such they belong to the employer rather than the consumer. They argued further that these accounts do not warrant coverage under the rule because they are not consumer asset accounts in the sense that their use is highly restricted and, for certain types of programs, the funds held in them are notional, rather than actual, in nature. A subset of these commenters also urged the Bureau to reconsider referring to specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code when specifying the types of programs that would qualify for the exclusion, noting that the Code's numbering may change in the future.",
                "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing exclusions for health savings accounts, flexible spending arrangements, medical savings accounts, and health reimbursement arrangements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(iv), renumbered as \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A). The Bureau is likewise finalizing proposed comment 2(b)(3)(iv)-1, renumbered as 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau is persuaded that accounts used to disburse funds related to these programs are fundamentally different from other prepaid accounts covered by the final rule. As stated in the proposal, these products are governed by the terms of their plans and related regulations, such that, for example, health savings accounts and medical savings accounts can typically only be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. The Bureau believes that the limited use of funds under such arrangements distinguish them from consumer transaction accounts. As such, the Bureau believes such accounts are appropriately excluded from the rule. The Bureau believes that the term account is reasonably interpreted not to include these types of products or, in the alternative, to further the purposes of EFTA; the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an express exclusion in final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A).",
                "The Bureau has also considered the comments requesting that additional categories of employer-sponsored compensation be added to the exclusion in \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A). The Bureau agrees that, to the extent other programs exist that are significantly similar to health savings accounts, flexible spending arrangements, medical savings accounts, and health reimbursement arrangements, those programs should also be excluded from the rule for the same reasons. Accordingly, the Bureau is expanding the exclusion to encompass accounts associated with other employer-sponsored benefit arrangements, namely, accounts used to disburse funds from a dependent care assistance program or a transit or parking reimbursement arrangement. The Bureau is adding a reference to these additional program types in final \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A) and the Internal Revenue Code sections that reference them in final comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau is finalizing that comment with references to the relevant Internal Revenue Code sections because it believes that specificity will help ensure that the exclusions remain limited in scope, and because it believes that the clarity provided by such specificity outweighs the potential difficulty that may occur in the event the numbering scheme of the Internal Revenue Code changes.",
                "The Bureau is otherwise finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A) and comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 as proposed. The Bureau notes, in response to commenters that requested that it add an exclusion for employee wellness programs, that such programs are likely excluded from the rule under the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards. That exclusion applies to loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, as defined in \u00a7\u20091005.20(a)(4) and (b). Existing comment 20(a)(4)-1.vi lists incentive programs through which an employer provides cards to employees to encourage employee wellness as a type of loyalty, award, or promotional gift card."

Generally, the Bureau believed that the information provided to consumers in the short form and long form disclosure should appear in a large enough font size to ensure that consumers can easily read the information. Further, the Bureau observed in its pre-proposal consumer testing that some participants had to use reading glasses or otherwise struggled to read existing prepaid account disclosures and that many participants reported a preference for larger font sizes to facilitate their ability both to read and to understand disclosures. Thus, the Bureau proposed minimum font size requirements for both the short form and long form disclosures in order to ensure that consumers can easily read the disclosures. In addition, the Bureau believed that the proposed relative font sizes for the disclosures made on the short form would ensure that consumers' attention is quickly drawn to the most important information about a prepaid account (i.e., the top-line fees).",
                        "The Bureau also noted in the proposal that the proposed minimum font sizes were likely also the maximum sizes that could be used on the short form disclosure to ensure that it will still fit on most packaging material currently used in retail settings. In other acquisition scenarios, when space constraints are not as much of an issue, the Bureau expected that financial institutions would use larger versions of the short form disclosure. For example, when distributing disclosures for payroll card accounts in printed form, financial institutions could use a 8.5x11 inch piece of paper to present a larger version of the short form disclosure, as long as the form maintains the visual hierarchy of the information as reflected in the proposed relative font size requirements. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(2), discussed in more detail below, would have required that the statement disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(10), and the telephone number and Web site URL disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(11) must be more prominent than the information disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(12) through (14) and proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C). The Bureau believed that it is particularly important for a consumer to see this information on the short form disclosure, and that making it more prominent than the other textual language on the short form could help to draw consumers' attention to these disclosures."

A consumer group commenter recommended that the Bureau require larger font size for disclosures provided in non-retail settings. It said that while small print may be unavoidable in retail stores, font size was not similarly constrained in other locations such as Web sites, bank branches, and in settings in which payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts are offered."

The Bureau is also adopting new comments 18(b)(7)(ii)-1 and -2 to provide additional clarification regarding type size requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii). See the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), (B), (C), and (D) below for prominence and size requirements with respect to typeface and type color generally as well as specific requirements regarding the general short form disclosure, the long form disclosure, and the multiple service plan short form disclosure, respectively.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing the proposed visual hierarchy of information for the short form disclosure created by requiring minimum type sizes in descending order because, as explained in the proposal, this format quickly garners consumers' attention, directing it first to the information the Bureau's research indicates is most important to consumers when selecting a prepaid account. The final rule also retains the actual type size requirements as proposed, with the addition of size requirements for newly-created permissible or required disclosures or those that were unspecified in the proposed rule. The Bureau continues to believe that the size requirements will ensure that consumers can read and understand the disclosures without struggling to see small print while also accommodating the existing packaging constraints for prepaid accounts sold at retail locations. Also, in the final rule, the Bureau has replaced \u201cfont\u201d size with \u201ctype\u201d size for clarity, as the term font can refer to both type size and type style. Finally, instead of stating that disclosures must be made in the \u201ccorresponding pixel size\u201d for electronic disclosures when providing the minimum type size for each element of the disclosures, the final rule includes the actual corresponding pixel size for each type size specified.",
                        "The Bureau declines to mandate type size requirements that vary depending on the setting in which consumers receive the pre-acquisition disclosures. As discussed above, the Bureau designed the minimum type sizes requirements for the short form disclosure, that appear in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B) and (D), to accommodate the existing packaging constraints related to the sale of prepaid accounts on J-hooks displays in retail locations. Financial institutions are encouraged, but not required, to use larger type sizes when providing pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts in less space-restrictive settings. For example, financial institutions offering prepaid accounts online, in a bank branch, in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, and in other similar circumstances are encouraged to provide the short form disclosure in a type size that exceeds the minimum requirements in the rule to enhance both consumer engagement and comprehension of the prepaid account's terms.",
                        "To illustrate this, both the proposed and final model forms for government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts use type sizes that exceed the regulatory minimum. See Model Forms A-10(a) and (b). Even when disclosing other information on the same page as the short form disclosure, such as when exercising the option to display State-required information or other fees and discounts on the same page as (but outside) the short form disclosure for these products pursuant to final \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii) and 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the Bureau believes the required disclosures can exceed the minimum size requirements set forth in the final rule. To that end, new comment 18(b)(7)(ii)-1 explains that a financial institution may provide disclosures in a type size larger than the required minimum to enhance consumer comprehension in any acquisition scenario, as long as the financial institution complies with the type/pixel size hierarchy set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii). New comment 18(b)(7)(ii)-2 clarifies that references in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii) to \u201cpoint\u201d size correspond to printed disclosures and references to \u201cpixel\u201d size correspond to disclosures provided via electronic means.",
                        "The Bureau declines to follow the recommendation of an industry commenter that the Bureau preempt certain State law font size requirements that it believes would be impracticable to reconcile with the Bureau's font size requirements. Section 1005.12(b) addresses standards for when inconsistent State law is preempted, but the Bureau does not read the comment to argue that the Bureau's font size requirements are inconsistent with any State law requirements. Moreover, the Bureau notes that financial institutions can provide short form disclosures for payroll accounts in a larger font and on 8.5\u2033 x 11\u2033 or larger paper, as they are not subject to the same space constraints, for example, as are many retail locations.",
                        "In addition, as explained in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(iii) below generally regarding State-required information not permitted within the short form disclosure, financial institutions are free to disclose State-required information outside the confines of the short form disclosure, even on the same page as the short form disclosure. In fact, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the final rule permits inclusion in the short form disclosure of a statement directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for certain information (ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee). Financial institutions have the option of providing other State-required information, including information complying with State conspicuousness requirements, in the location referenced in the short form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or in any other location the financial institution sees fit outside the short form disclosure. Because financial institutions have these options outside the short form disclosure to disclose information required by or otherwise comply with the laws of specific States, the Bureau does not believe either further modification to this final rule nor preemption of State law regarding prominence and size is necessary or appropriate."

According to the request, these accounts allow servicemembers to conduct closed-loop transactions in forward-deployed environments, such as an army base or a naval vessel, where cash is inconvenient and other commercially available payments technologies are unavailable. These accounts sometimes offer a P2P feature that allows users to transfer loaded funds to other accountholders from the closed-loop \u201cpurse\u201d of the account, but such functionality, the Bureau understands, is incidental to the primary closed-loop function of the account.",

This express exclusion will protect servicemember consumers by ensuring that they have access to a convenient and well-established payment method at a time when alternate payment methods such as cash or bank accounts may not be available for operational reasons. The Bureau notes that this is a narrow exclusion intended to accommodate a specific set of closed-loop products that are used in unique circumstances, such as on military vessels or bases, or similar government facilities (e.g., embassies or consulates) in remote locations. The Bureau notes further that, to the extent that such accounts offer an open-loop capability that allows the consumer to conduct transactions at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, that functionality would not be covered by this exclusion."

                "Several commenters, including a payment network, an issuing bank, several industry trade associations, and a national relief organization, urged the Bureau to add a separate exclusion for accounts used to distribute disaster relief funds. Most notably, the national relief organization noted that the accounts used to distribute the funds, as well as the funds themselves, are the property of the relief organization, not the consumer, which makes these accounts distinct from other consumer asset accounts the Bureau proposed to cover. Commenters argued that such accounts are different because consumers who receive these accounts cannot shop for them, and tend to use them for a short period of time without reloading\u2014in most cases, the trade association commenter noted, the cards will expire if not used within 60 days. The payment network argued that the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure requirements would delay consumers' receipt of relief funds in the wake of tragic events. In addition, commenters noted that these accounts rarely feature any of the fees that would be required to be disclosed on the proposed short form. Accordingly, these commenters asserted, covering these accounts under the Bureau's final rule on prepaid accounts would increase the cost of providing them to consumers in need for the sake of disclosures that are neither necessary nor useful to those consumers. The national relief organization, which uses prepaid cards to disburse disaster relief funds in some circumstances, noted further that the proposed disclosure requirements in conjunction with the packaging replacement requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) would render much of its prepaid card inventory useless. A consumer group commenter, by contrast, argued that disaster relief cards should not be excluded so long as they are used in the same way as other prepaid accounts\u2014 i.e., as open-loop accounts used to make purchases at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.",
                "The Bureau agrees that the nature of these accounts\u2014such as, for example, the fact that the underlying funds are owned by the relief organization, rather than the consumer\u2014warrant their exclusion from the rule. The Bureau believes that such an exclusion is further warranted because, on balance, the burden of requiring these accounts to comply with the requirements of this final rule outweighs the potential utility of those requirements to consumers who have had the misfortune of experiencing a disastrous event. The Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate at this time to place such additional burdens on providers. Accordingly, to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an express exclusion in new \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(ii)(B) for accounts that are established directly or indirectly by a third party and loaded only with qualified disaster relief payments. This express exclusion will protect consumers by ensuring that they have quick access to crucial funds provided by disaster relief organizations in the wake of tragic events. The Bureau is also adding new comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-2 to clarify that the exclusion is limited to funds made available through a qualified disaster relief program, as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code."

The Bureau proposed to allow each electronic and written history to include an abbreviated error resolution notice, in lieu of an annual notice, for parity with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(d)(2) for prepaid accounts generally.

These commenters argued that providing an annual notice is costly, that many such notices get returned to the sender without being opened, and that consumers with dormant accounts who receive these notices may be confused and led to believe that their government benefits were being affected in some way.",

The Bureau believes that the limited nature of prepaid accounts that cannot be or have not been verified by a financial institution does not justify requiring financial institutions to provide written account transaction histories upon request for these accounts. The Bureau believes that these accounts do not typically remain active for more than 12 months, and even if they do, they are usually only used to conduct a limited number of transactions. In addition, a financial institution will not likely have a physical address for an unverified prepaid account, and therefore, cannot mail a copy of the consumer's written account transaction history.

The Bureau believed that many financial institutions charge consumers fees when they do not use their prepaid accounts for a specified period of time. The Bureau believed disclosure of these fees is important insofar as consumers sometimes acquire a prepaid account for occasional use; such consumers may want to know that a particular prepaid account program charges fees for inactivity.\n          Thus, the Bureau proposed that financial institutions disclose the existence, duration, and amount of inactivity fees, or that no such fee will be charged, as part the short form disclosure. The Bureau also noted in the proposal, however, that, as with all the disclosures in the short form, the requirement to disclose a particular fee type was not an endorsement of such a fee.",

The Bureau believed that a lower inactivity fee may correlate with a prepaid account product imposing a higher monthly periodic fee on a consumer. Thus, consumers using a prepaid account only sporadically, but often enough to not reach the dormancy period that would trigger the inactivity fee, might actually incur higher fees if they shop based on the inactivity fee instead of the monthly periodic fee. In preparing the proposal, the Bureau considered whether the risk of potential confusion to a consumer outweighed the benefit of including the inactivity fee on the short form disclosure, but believed that providing consumers with the inactivity fee amount and the relevant duration of dormancy would allow consumers to make an informed choice about which prepaid account product is best for their usage patterns."

In response to the Bureau's solicitation of comments as to whether inactivity fees should be included in the short form disclosure, the program manager responded that disclosure of both the monthly fee and the inactivity fee would not confuse consumers, as most prepaid products either charge a monthly fee or an inactivity fee, but not both. Even if both fees are charged, it said, consumers can get more information about the fees from the long form disclosure or on the Web site associated with the prepaid program disclosed on the short form. In contrast, the trade association and the issuing bank urged the Bureau not to require disclosure of inactivity fees because, they said, both studies of prepaid cards that they reviewed and information provided to the trade association by its members indicate that inactivity fees are not commonly charged. Additionally, the commenters said there are better means than the short form through which consumers can learn about inactivity fees, such as the Bureau's Web site, the prepaid issuer's Web site or its customer service, and that contact information for those sources is included in the short form disclosure. The consumer group and the office of a State Attorney General recommended primarily that the Bureau ban inactivity fees, but otherwise generally supported the disclosure.",

The consumer group also stated that the inactivity fee can be known as \u201cdormancy\u201d or \u201cmaintenance\u201d fees, and that the Bureau should require standardized terminology to avoid confusion.",
                        "The office of the State Attorney General also recommended that the Bureau require a minimum 10-day notice prior to imposition of an inactivity fee on a payroll card account.

The commenter asserted that the notice should be provided through the employee's preferred method of receiving communications from the payroll card account vendor."

Because some consumers use prepaid cards on an infrequent or occasional basis, the Bureau continues to believe that disclosure of the inactivity fee is important to provide specific information to consumers regarding the consequences of their prepaid account use patterns, even though not all financial institutions may charge this fee. The Bureau understands the concerns of those commenters seeking to have the fee removed from the short form, but believes that other means of communicating this potentially significant fee are insufficient.",
                        "In the final rule, in place of the proposed disclosure of the \u201cduration of inactivity,\u201d the Bureau is requiring the broader disclosure of the \u201cconditions\u201d that trigger the financial institution to impose the inactivity fee.\n          This change is intended to ensure that more relevant information is disclosed, including what the consumer must do to avoid imposition of the inactivity fee (such as engaging in at least one transaction during a specified time period), the time period after which the fee is imposed, and how often the fee is assessed. The Bureau has made corresponding changes to comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1, and also removed the direction to financial institutions to specify in the long form whether the inactivity fee is imposed in lieu of or in addition to the periodic fee, having relocated this portion of the comment to final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-2, which addresses disclosure in the long form of any conditions under which a fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. Final comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1 also contains an illustrative example of an inactivity fee disclosure. Finally, the Bureau made other technical modifications to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vii) and comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1 for conformity and clarity.",
                        "In response to the comment from a consumer group that proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(7)-1 implicitly endorses the simultaneous charge of both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee, the Bureau reiterates that it does not endorse such a practice nor is it aware of any financial institution that imposes both fees at the same time. However, the Bureau believes it is important that consumers be clearly apprised if their prepaid account charges a periodic fee and an inactivity fee in tandem and for this reason it is included in the commentary for the final rule's long form disclosure requirements. In response to the consumer group recommending that the Bureau require standardized terminology for the inactivity fee disclosure to avoid consumer confusion, because the final rule requires financial institutions to make this disclosure using the term \u201cinactivity fee\u201d or a substantially similar term, the Bureau expects that financial institutions will not use substantially different terminology that would confuse consumers. The Bureau also notes that final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(8), discussed below, requires financial institutions to use fee names and other terms consistently within and across the short form and long form disclosures.",

                "Some industry commenters voiced concern regarding the interplay between the short form disclosure required for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) and disclosure of information required by State law and other fee discounts and waivers for these products.\n        In response to these concerns, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) which states that, for payroll card accounts, a financial institution may, but is not required to, include a statement in one additional line of text directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. This statement must be located directly below any statements disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii) (regarding variable fees), or, if no such statements are disclosed, above the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x) (regarding overdraft credit features). In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1. The Bureau is also adopting a similar provision for government benefit accounts in final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii).",

However, neither the proposed rule nor this final rule's segregation requirements prohibit such disclosures near, but outside, of the short form. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(iii), as discussed in detail below, provides that the short form and long form disclosures must be segregated from other information and must contain only information that is required or permitted for those disclosures by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b). Thus, while additional information may not be added to the short form, there is no prohibition in the proposed or final rule against including other information, such as the State-required disclosures or other fee discounts and waivers, on the same page as the short form. Moreover, because payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts are not subject to the same space constraints as prepaid accounts sold in retail locations, the short form disclosure for such accounts likely can accommodate additional information on the same page as the short form disclosure.",
                "The Bureau examined the potential feasibility of the optional statement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) during its post-proposal consumer testing. Specifically, testing was conducted to ascertain whether consumers understood the relationship between specific information provided on the same page as (but outside) the short form to the information inside the short form.\n        The discounts/waivers listed below the short form were generally related to a fee that was asterisked in the prototype short form to indicate the fee can be lower.\n        To help direct participants' attention to these additional disclosures, the short form included the following statement below the asterisk statement: \u201cSee below for free ways to access your funds and balance information.\u201d In addition, in one round of testing, participants were provided with both a prototype short form and a long form to see if they could locate information about specific fees that were not included within the short form. In post-proposal consumer testing, the majority of participants understood and could use this information.\n        Based on this testing, the Bureau believes that consumers will be able to understand the connection between information in the short form and other information that financial institutions may include on the same page as, but outside, the short form disclosure. The Bureau believes that permitting such a statement in the short form for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) will not disrupt consumer engagement and comprehension and would help industry accommodate for any potential discrepancies between Federal and State disclosure requirements.",
                "New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1 provides several examples of how a financial institution might disclose in the short form for payroll card accounts a statement directing consumers to outside the short form to find information on conditions for a consumer to access funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee in accordance with \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B). Specifically, the comment states that, for example, a financial institution might include the following line of text in the short form disclosure: \u201cSee below for free ways to access your funds and balance information\u201d and then list below, but on the same page as, the short form disclosure several ways consumers can access their payroll card account funds and balance information for free. Alternatively, the financial institution might direct the consumer to another location for that information, such as by stating \u201cSee the cardholder agreement for free ways to access your funds and balance information.\u201d The comment also notes that a similar statement is permitted for government benefit accounts pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.15(c)(2)(ii)."

For example, under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), a consumer would not have been entitled to error resolution rights or protection from unauthorized transactions until after registering the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that this is an important protection insofar as unregistered prepaid accounts are like cash\u2014once lost, funds may be difficult or impossible to protect or replace because the financial institution may not know who the rightful cardholder is.",

The Bureau did propose, however, that financial institutions would have to disclose a statement on the short form if a prepaid account is not set up to be eligible for FDIC (or NCUSIF) pass-through deposit (or share) insurance."

The remaining commenters said the registration requirement was not relevant for payroll card accounts and/or government benefit accounts because registration occurs prior to card issuance and because such accounts would be required to provide error resolution and limited liability protections regardless of registration. The program manager suggested that the space could be better used to disclose other information, such as how to access full wages without fees for payroll card accounts."

Several industry trade associations and a credit union supported the Bureau's proposed disclosure requirement; one commenter noted that it is essential for consumers to know that they could lose their money if the financial institution were to fail. Most industry commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau require disclosure of both when pass-through deposit insurance is available and when it is not.

In particular, many consumer groups, individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group, and the offices of two State Attorneys General argued that disclosures are insufficient in this instance and requested that the Bureau require that prepaid account funds be held in custodial accounts that carry deposit insurance. Several commenters requested FDIC insurance for specific accounts, such as payroll card accounts and registered prepaid accounts.

Because certain protections do not attach until registration, such that unregistered prepaid accounts are akin in some ways to carrying cash, the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be aware that they should register their accounts. As discussed below, the final rule links the act of registration with insurance coverage and other protections. The Bureau believes that, even absent a consumer's full understanding of the protections afforded by registration, linking registration to insurance coverage and other protections will help motivate consumers to register their prepaid accounts.",
                        "Similarly, the Bureau believes it is important to disclose to consumers information about insurance coverage. While the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that some consumers erroneously equate FDIC coverage with fraud or theft protection, a number of participants understood that the insurance protects consumers' funds in the case of bank insolvency.\n          Regardless of their understanding of what FDIC insurance actually protects against, most participants identified insurance coverage as positive and wanted to know whether the prepaid card they were considering buying in the testing scenario offered this protection. The Bureau understands that the attachment of pass-through FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance can be a complex matter determined by many factors, including how the financial institution has structured the program and the accuracy of its recordkeeping. The Bureau believes that, even absent a full understanding of the attachment requirements and the protections afforded by insurance coverage, disclosing whether a prepaid account program provides insurance coverage will educate consumers and a combined insurance and registration disclosure will help motivate consumers to register their prepaid accounts, when applicable.",

First, registration is a prerequisite to insurance protection; the two processes are conceptually linked and the Bureau believes that disclosing them together will help consumers appreciate this cause and effect. Also, while under the proposed rule registration would have been a prerequisite to certain Regulation E protections, the final rule expands error resolution and limited liability protections for unregistered consumers, thereby reducing the urgency to emphasize registration in its own dedicated line in the short form disclosure. See final \u00a7\u20091005.18(e). Moreover, the additional space in the short form created by combining these disclosures has allowed the Bureau to permit the addition of other information to the form while remaining in keeping with the size constraints of existing J-hook packaging. See, e.g., final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (3)(ii). The Bureau believes that melding these two disclosures into a single line will provide more rational and efficient information to consumers.",
                        "Second, the Bureau believes that disclosure of both the existence or lack of insurance eligibility will be more beneficial to consumers than disclosing only when insurance is not available. Consistent with the position of many commenters, the Bureau found in its post-proposal consumer testing that, while participants understood the meaning of statements regarding coverage and non-coverage, when the prototype short form was silent (as it would be under the proposed rule if the prepaid account program was eligible for insurance coverage) most participants did not understand that to mean insurance was offered.\n          The Bureau was thus concerned that the proposed model forms' silence when a program is eligible for insurance coverage would not be effective in communicating to consumers that a prepaid account program is eligible for insurance coverage.",
                        "The final rule refers to NCUA, rather than NCUSIF, insurance for credit unions. After further consideration and based on information received during the interagency consultation process, the Bureau believes the term \u201cNCUA\u201d may be more meaningful to consumers than \u201cNCUSIF\u201d and has revised the disclosures accordingly in both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) and (4)(iii).",
                        "In response to concerns raised by commenters, the Bureau has tailored the final rule to take into account the existence and timing of a financial institution's consumer identification and verification process. For some types of prepaid account programs, such as payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, financial institutions conduct customer identification and verification before the card is distributed or activated, while others, such as certain non-reloadable cards, may have no customer identification and verification process at all. As noted above, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text of the final rule specific language that financial institutions should use to make the disclosure for clarity.

The Bureau did not receive any comments in response to this request.

Thus, new comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 clarifies when to use the term \u201cFDIC\u201d and when to use \u201cNCUA.\u201d Specifically, the comment explains that if the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a credit union, the disclosure must indicate NCUA insurance eligibility. The comment goes on to say that if the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a financial institution other than a credit union, the disclosure must indicate FDIC insurance eligibility. As a result of requests received during the interagency consultation process, the disclosures of both FDIC and NCUA insurance pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xi) expressly reflect eligibility in the statement, to put consumers acquiring prepaid accounts on notice that insurance protections may not attach in all cases. This includes, for example, when the consumer is not a member of the issuing credit union with respect to NCUA.",
                        "New comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-2 addresses certain aspects of customer identification and verification. Specifically, the comment cross-references final \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) and comments 18(e)-4 and -5 for additional guidance on the timing of customer identification and verification processes, and on prepaid account programs for which there is no customer identification and verification process for any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program.",
                        "The Bureau considered adding additional information to the registration and insurance disclosure in the short form, as requested by one commenter, such as an explanation of what protections in addition to insurance eligibility registration provides or more fulsome information about the implications of insurance coverage. However, in light of overall space constraints and the multiple goals for the short form, the Bureau ultimately decided against adding any more information to the registration/insurance disclosure. The Bureau believes this disclosure balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension of the short form disclosure. The Bureau is, however, requiring financial institutions to provide more detailed information about insurance coverage in the long form disclosure. See final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(iii).",
                        "In light of the results of the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements indicating that many products meeting the proposed definition of prepaid account already provide pass-through deposit insurance coverage, consumers' misunderstandings about what protections pass-through deposit insurance actually affords, and the complexities inherent in ensuring pass-through insurance coverage, the Bureau is not including a requirement mandating FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage at this time."

Because payroll card accounts would be largely subsumed into the proposed definition of prepaid account, the Bureau proposed to revise \u00a7\u20091005.18 by replacing it with provisions governing prepaid accounts, which the Bureau proposed to apply to payroll card accounts as well. Each of the provisions of \u00a7\u20091005.18 is discussed in turn below.",
                "Regarding the Bureau's proposed approach to \u00a7\u20091005.18, several commenters, including industry trade associations, program managers, and issuing banks, argued that payroll card accounts should not be treated the same as other prepaid accounts, because they are already heavily regulated by State laws, and, unlike prepaid accounts sold at retail, are not distributed or marketed to the general public. These commenters thus urged the Bureau to finalize the provisions related to payroll card accounts specifically in a separate section, rather than to subsume those provisions into proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18. They argued that maintaining two separate sections would ease compliance and provide regulatory clarity and certainty for issuers and employers. One issuing bank, however, took the opposite position, arguing that there was no reason to treat payroll card accounts distinctly from other prepaid accounts.",
                "As discussed in more detail in the Overview of the Bureau's Approach to Regulation E section and the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) above, the Bureau believes that there is substantial value to both consumers and financial institutions in promoting consistent treatment across products. In addition, the Bureau believes that, to the extent many GPR cards already comply with existing regulations for payroll card accounts, financial institutions already treat payroll card accounts and GPR cards similarly. Similarly, the Bureau believes that maintaining the current numbering system that financial institutions already complying with Regulation E have come to rely on\u2014 i.e., keeping provisions related to government benefit accounts in \u00a7\u20091005.15 and provisions related to payroll card accounts in \u00a7\u20091005.18\u2014will enhance compliance by preventing unnecessary confusion. Thus, although there are several provisions in final \u00a7\u20091005.18 that distinguish payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) from other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to subsume the requirements for payroll card accounts into the requirements for prepaid accounts generally in final \u00a7\u20091005.18. The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.15 separately for government benefit accounts, however, because of the unique complexities surrounding who constitutes a financial institution for purposes of that section (and Regulation E generally) with respect to government benefit accounts."

The Bureau sought general comment on whether it should subsume all requirements for government benefit accounts into \u00a7\u20091005.18, as well. The majority of industry commenters who commented on this issue supported maintaining a separate section for requirements specifically applicable to government benefit accounts, arguing that government benefit accounts had unique legal and functional characteristics that warranted separate treatment. No commenter opposed maintaining a separate section for government benefit cards. After considering the comments and reading no reasons to the contrary, the Bureau is maintaining the government benefit account provisions in a separate section (\u00a7\u20091005.15) as proposed."

                        "The new disclosure regime for prepaid accounts requires a financial institution to provide a consumer with both a \u201cshort form\u201d and a \u201clong form\u201d disclosure pre-acquisition. The short form sets forth the prepaid account's most important fees and certain other information to facilitate consumer understanding of the account's key terms and aid comparison shopping among prepaid account programs.\n          The long form disclosure, on the other hand, provides the consumer with a comprehensive list of all of the fees associated with the prepaid account and detailed information on how those fees are assessed, as well as certain other information about the prepaid account program. The long form provides consumers an opportunity to review all fee information about a prepaid account before acquiring it. In sum, the short form provides a snapshot of key fees and information, while its companion disclosure, the long form, provides an unabridged, straightforward list of fees and greater detail regarding use of the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau understands that there are many methods through which a consumer can acquire a prepaid account, and it has designed the final rule's disclosure regime to be adaptable to all these methods. For example, a consumer might purchase a prepaid account at retail, online through a financial institution's Web site (or the Web site of a service provider such as a program manager), or by telephoning the financial institution (or program manager). An employee might receive a payroll card account from an employer, or a student might receive a prepaid account from his or her university in connection with the disbursement of financial aid. A government benefit recipient might receive benefit payments on a government benefit card distributed by the agency responsible for administering those benefits, or an insurance company might distribute prepaid cards to consumers to disburse property or casualty insurance proceeds.",
                        "The Bureau has tailored the final rule to accommodate these varied methods while maintaining the overall integrity of the required disclosures. This tailoring includes permitting special formatting for prepaid disclosures delivered electronically; permitting disclosure of discounts and waivers for the periodic fee; permitting information within the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) directing consumers to sources of information regarding State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers; and accommodating disclosure of fees for optional services as well as those charged on non-traditional prepaid accounts, such as digital wallets, via a requirement to disclose certain information about additional types of fees not otherwise disclosed on the short form. The Bureau believes that creating a generally consistent and comprehensive disclosure regime that applies before the consumer's acquisition of a prepaid account will ensure that any consumer who obtains a prepaid account, regardless of the type of prepaid account or its method of acquisition, will receive relevant information at an opportune time in the acquisition sequence to better inform his or her purchase and use decisions.",
                        "The content and structure of the short form and long form disclosures set forth in the final rule largely mirror that of the proposed rule, although the Bureau has refined various elements and reorganized the disclosure provisions in the final rule to simplify the structure and aid compliance. See the individual section-by-section analyses below under this \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) for a more detailed discussion of each aspect of the final pre-acquisition disclosure regime.

The short form disclosure, designed to provide a snapshot of key fees and information for a prepaid account, features a section for fees and a section for certain other information. The fee section must appear in the form of a table, and consists of two parts. The first part contains \u201cstatic\u201d fees, setting forth standardized fee disclosures that must be provided for all prepaid account programs, even if such fees are $0 or if they relate to features not offered by a particular program. The second part provides information about some additional types of fees that may be charged for that prepaid account program.",
                        "Specifically, the static portion of the short form fee disclosures features a \u201ctop line\u201d component highlighting four types of fees at the top of the form: The periodic fee, the per purchase fee, ATM withdrawal fees (parsed out for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals in the United States), and the cash reload fee. As discussed in more detail in part III.A above, the Bureau believes these fees are the most important to consumers when shopping for a prepaid account. For this reason, the top line is designed to quickly draw the attention of consumers through its dominant location and use of larger and more prominent type than that used for the remainder of the disclosures on the short form. Located just below the top line are disclosures for three other types of fees: ATM balance inquiry fees (parsed out for both in- and out-of-network balance inquiries in the United States), customer service fees (parsed out for both live and automated customer service), and the inactivity fee. While the final rule generally prohibits disclosure of third-party fees, the final rule requires that the cash reload fee disclosed in the top line include third-party fees.",
                        "The static fees are followed by a portion of the disclosure that addresses additional types of fees specific to that prepaid account program. For the final rule, the Bureau has brought together the proposed statement disclosing the number of \u201cother fees\u201d not listed on the short form disclosure and the proposed disclosure of \u201cincidence-based fees\u201d into a common category referred to as \u201cadditional fee types\u201d and located these disclosures together on the short form immediately following the static fee disclosures. First, the final rule requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account (the proposal would have required disclosure of the total number of individual fees rather than fee types). Second, the final rule requires a statement explaining to consumers that what follows are examples of some of those additional fee types.",
                        "Next, the two additional fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers above a de minimis threshold must be disclosed. These fee types must be calculated for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. In general, financial institutions must assess their additional fee types every 24 months and, if necessary, update their disclosures. There is an exception to this requirement, however, such that financial institutions are not required to pull and replace disclosures provided on, in, or with prepaid account packaging material if there is a change in the additional fee types required to be listed. (Under the proposal, this disclosure would have been based on incidence rather than revenue, would have been three fees rather than two, and updating would have been required every 12 rather than 24 months. The de minimis threshold and assessment across programs that share the same fee schedule are also new to the final rule.) The final rule also contains additional flexibility regarding the timing for reassessments, voluntary disclosures of additional fee types in certain circumstances, and disclosure of fee variations within additional fee types.",
                        "The final, non-fee section of the short form is comprised of a series of statements containing certain other key information regarding the prepaid account. The final rule generally requires disclosure of the highest fee when the price of a service or feature may vary and permits use of a symbol, such as an asterisk, to indicate that those fees may vary; the statement linked to that asterisk must appear below the fee disclosures. The final rule also permits use of a different symbol, such as a dagger, to provide specific information about waivers or discounts for the periodic fee only. Next is a statement indicating whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered in connection with the prepaid account and, if so, an explanation that the feature may be offered after a certain number of days and that fees would apply. In contrast to the proposal, the final rule requires disclosure both when a prepaid account is set up to be eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance and when it is not, and combines this statement with the call to action for the consumer to register the account, if applicable. The final rule requires disclosure of the URL for a Bureau Web site from which consumers can obtain general information on prepaid accounts. The short form disclosure concludes with a statement directing consumers to where they can obtain information on all fees and services for that particular prepaid account program. The Bureau has incorporated into the regulatory text of the final rule specific language for each of these statements rather than referencing the model forms for such language.",
                        "Short form disclosures for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts). The final rule contains an additional requirement and an additional accommodation for short form disclosures for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts). For these accounts, like in the proposal, financial institutions are required to include a statement regarding alternate wage (or benefits) payment options above the top-line fee disclosures. The final rule permits financial institutions to choose between two different statements to make this disclosure. The first statement simply informs consumers that they do not have to accept the card and directs them to ask about other ways to receive their wages. The alternative statement informs consumers that they have several options to receive their wages, followed by a list of those options, and directs them to tell their employer which option they choose. The final rule also permits financial institutions to include an optional line in the informational statements portion of the short form disclosure for these accounts directing consumers to a particular location outside the short form for State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers.",
                        "Short form disclosures for multiple service plans. The final rule permits financial institutions offering prepaid account programs with multiple service plans to use a short form disclosure specifically tailored for these products. The Bureau has redesigned the multiple service plan short form to be more simple and clear, incorporating a multi-columned structure for displaying all short form fees across all plans.",
                        "Additional disclosures outside the short form. The final rule requires that the following information be disclosed outside but in close proximity to the short form: The name of the financial institution; the name of the prepaid account program; and the purchase price and activation fee, if any.",
                        "The long form disclosure. The long form disclosure is the second part of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime for prepaid accounts and complements the short form disclosure. It sets forth in a table all of the prepaid account's fees and their qualifying conditions as well as other information about the prepaid account program. Similar to the short form, the long form also contains a series of statements following the fee table containing certain other key information regarding the prepaid account. First is a statement regarding registration and FDIC or NCUA insurance eligibility that mirrors the statement required for the short form, together with an explanation of the benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage. Next is a statement indicating whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered in connection with the prepaid account and, if so, an explanation that the feature may be offered after a certain number of days and that fees would apply; this statement also mirrors the one required in the short form disclosure. The final rule also requires contact information for the financial institution; the URL of a Bureau Web site where the consumer can obtain general information on prepaid accounts; and the Bureau Web site URL and telephone number to submit a complaint about a prepaid account. Finally, the long form must include certain Regulation Z disclosures if, at any point, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 may be offered in connection with the prepaid account. The final rule provides a safe harbor for financial institutions from having to reprint the long form disclosure due to changes in third-party fees or the Regulation Z disclosures.",
                        "Form and format of the disclosures. The final rule contains detailed provisions addressing the form and formatting of the short form and long form disclosures. These provisions reflect the changes to the multiple service plan short form design, discussed above, as well as several additional exceptions to the general retainability requirement for the pre-acquisition disclosures and clarification regarding how certain requirements apply to electronic disclosures (including how to comply with the requirement that electronic disclosures be viewable across all screen sizes). The final rule contains additional formatting requirements to address new disclosure elements added to the final rule, including several optional elements discussed above. The final rule also contains a provision requiring that fee names and other terms be used consistently within and across the short form and long form disclosures.",
                        "Model and sample disclosure forms. The final rule contains five model form variations for the short form disclosure: Two iterations of the short form disclosures generally, one for payroll card accounts, one for government benefit accounts, and one for prepaid account programs with multiple service plans. See Model Forms A-10(a) through (e). The final rule also contains a sample long form disclosure. See Sample Form A-10(f). The model forms provide a safe harbor to financial institutions that use them (provided that the model forms are used accurately and appropriately), unlike the sample form which serves only as an example. Whether a financial institution chooses to use a model form for its short form disclosure or design its long form disclosure based on the long form, the financial institution must of course tailor its disclosures for the specific prepaid account program in order to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b).",

                        "Timing requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures generally and the alternative timing regime for prepaid accounts acquired at retail locations and orally by telephone. The final rule generally requires that the disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) be provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. Commentary to the final rule explains that a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account, and includes several examples.",
                        "Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also provides special rules for situations in which a consumer acquires a prepaid account at retail or orally by telephone. In these situations, a financial institution must provide the short form disclosure to the consumer prior to acquisition and must provide methods for consumers to access the long form by telephone and via a Web site prior to acquisition. If these conditions are met, the financial institution does not need to provide the long form in writing until after acquisition. The Bureau has expanded this exception in the final rule to cover all retail locations (rather than just retail stores) that sell prepaid accounts in person, without regard to whether the location is operated by a financial institution's agent. A financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts in its own branches does not qualify for the retail location exception with respect to those prepaid accounts.",

A financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if the financial institution uses that same foreign language in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account in certain circumstances. Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require a financial institution to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if an employee of the financial institution or a third party uses that foreign language in person with the consumer. The financial institution also must provide the long form disclosure in English upon a consumer's request and on its Web site."

As the Bureau explained in the proposal, for instance, the Bureau understood based on its outreach that many financial institutions were providing only limited fee information on the outside of packaging for GPR cards, so that consumers would have to purchase the card to access comprehensive information about the card's fees and terms. Similarly, the Bureau was concerned about the acquisition process for payroll card accounts, where new employees often receive account terms and conditions documents at the same time they received large quantities of other benefits-related paperwork, and about the sequencing of account disclosures in an online environment.",
                        "Second, the Bureau believed that it was important to provide specific formatting information that would ensure substantial consistency to facilitate consumers' comparison and selection process across a range of acquisition channels and carefully balance concerns about information overload. The Bureau therefore designed and developed its proposed pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts over the course of several years through a process that included consumer testing conducted both prior to and after the publication of the proposal and feedback from stakeholders in direct meetings, comments responding to the Prepaid ANPR, and follow up to a blog post of prototype disclosure designs.",
                        "The majority of both industry and consumer groups agreed that it was important for consumers to receive disclosures before they purchase a prepaid account. Industry and consumer groups encouraged the Bureau to develop disclosures to accommodate the variety of distribution channels through which prepaid products are distributed and sold, while also considering how distribution may evolve in the future. The majority also strongly supported standardized disclosures, instead of a more general rule requiring only that fees be disclosed clearly and conspicuously without providing specific instructions or model forms. However, industry mostly advocated that on-package disclosures should include only the fees that a consumer would most commonly incur while using a prepaid account, in order to increase the likelihood that consumers would understand and use the disclosures. On the other hand, many consumer groups urged provision of a full disclosure to the consumer of all fees associated with a GPR card, voicing concern that consumers would not get a full understanding of a prepaid account's true costs without comprehensive fee information and that providers could subvert a limited scope disclosure by adjusting fee schedules to increase or add fees not required to be disclosed on a shorter disclosure.",
                        "To balance such concerns, the Bureau proposed to require financial institutions to provide both a short form and a long form disclosure, as generally described above, prior to the time the consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed short form focused on the fees charged most frequently across most types of prepaid account programs, as well as providing limited information about the three fees incurred most frequently by users of the particular program. The short form thus would have provided largely consistent information for purposes of comparison, while also providing certain unique information about other fees that were charged most frequently to consumers (so-called \u201cincidence-based fees\u201d) and other cues encouraging the consumer to consult the long form for more detailed and comprehensive information. The Bureau also proposed to require that financial institutions provide the disclosures in languages other than English in certain circumstances.",
                        "Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2) would have set forth the substantive requirements for the Bureau's proposed prepaid account pre-acquisition disclosure regime, with content requirements for the short form disclosures addressed by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i), content requirements for the long form disclosure addressed by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii), and form and formatting requirements for both disclosures addressed by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3) and (4), respectively.",
                        "Depending on the structure of a particular prepaid account, however, the Bureau recognized that the proposed short form may not capture all of a particular prepaid account's fees or explain the conditions under which a financial institution might impose those fees. The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated that when participants were shown prototype short forms, most understood that they represented only a subset of fee information and that they could potentially be charged fees not shown on the form.\n          Further, except in certain retail stores or with respect to accounts acquired orally by telephone, under the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime, a consumer would have received a long form disclosure simultaneously with the short form and therefore have the opportunity to see all fees associated with a prepaid account and any relevant conditions before acquiring a prepaid account. In addition, in pre-proposal testing, most participants did not identify any additional fees that they would have wanted to see listed in a short form.\n          The Bureau believed that the proposed short form contained most fees that might be charged in connection with a prepaid account and the fees listed are those that are most important for a consumer to know in advance of acquiring a prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau also recognized that disclosing even this proposed subset of fee information on the short form ran the same risk of information overload that the Bureau believed could occur if all fees were disclosed to a consumer instead of just a subset of fees. The Bureau believed, however, based on its pre-proposal consumer testing and other research, that incorporating elements of visual hierarchy would mitigate these risks. Most importantly, the fee types that would have been disclosed pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (4) in the top line of the short form would have used font size and other elements to promote readability."

Discussed in this section are the comments provided in response as well as certain other general comments received. Comments regarding particular aspects of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime are addressed in the applicable section-by-section analyses below.",
                        "Several State government agencies, a majority of consumer groups, and a substantial number of industry commenters (including trade associations, a credit union, and a program manager) expressed general support for the proposed pre-acquisition regime, although most also offered criticisms and recommendations for change of some individual elements. The credit union and industry trade associations complimented the Bureau on the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures, with some commenters calling the short form disclosure an elegant and smart solution that would give consumers a clear, simple, and consumer friendly way to review critical data when shopping for prepaid accounts. Consumer groups and individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group also strongly supported the design and content of the proposed short form and long form disclosures as essential to protecting consumers. In particular, the consumer groups praised the short form disclosure's clear standardized form, saying it provides a good balance between simplicity and completeness.",
                        "Most industry commenters offered specific criticisms of or recommended changes to specific elements of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime. Industry commenters' more general criticisms of the proposed disclosures included both that the amount of information in the short form disclosure would be overwhelming to consumers (and thus certain aspects should be eliminated, such as the disclosure of the number of additional fees, incidence-based fees, or any incidental fees that are excluded from the disclosure requirements of Regulation DD) and that the short form failed to provide certain information that the commenters believed to be meaningful to consumers' purchase decisions (such as disclosure of fee waivers and discounts instead of disclosure of the highest fee as proposed) and thus that additional information should be added.",
                        "More globally, one academic group and several industry commenters (including program managers, a credit union, and a regional credit union trade association) urged the Bureau to eliminate both the short form and long form disclosures. These commenters said variously that the proposed disclosures would overwhelm consumers, burden industry without commensurate benefits to consumers, or duplicate the initial disclosures already required by Regulation E. They also asserted that research by the Bureau and others indicated that few consumers engage in formal comparison shopping among prepaid accounts or that consumers lack the financial literacy or inclination to read disclosures (and thus, the Bureau's efforts to facilitate comparison shopping are unnecessary). One of the program managers and the academic group asserted that the highly competitive prepaid marketplace, which in their view had already produced lower fees and simpler fee structures, was sufficient to meet the evolving needs of consumers. Industry commenters expressed concern regarding the burden they felt the proposed disclosures would impose; the program manager elaborated that the proposed disclosure regime would require expensive and time-consuming redesign of disclosures and changes in packaging, manufacturing processes, and distribution.",
                        "A number of other industry commenters and a group of members of Congress opposed one, but not both, of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures. A few industry commenters (including an issuing credit union, a credit union association, and a program manager) recommended eliminating the short form disclosure in favor of the long form disclosure. A larger group (including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, and the group of members of Congress) recommended eliminating the long form disclosure in favor of the short form\u2014or at least that the long form not be required to be provided pre-acquisition or only be required to be provided online, over the telephone, or upon request. As a whole, both groups of commenters asserted that requiring both of the proposed disclosures would result in too many disclosures (the short form and long form, prepaid account agreement containing initial disclosures, and State-required disclosures for payroll card accounts), resulting in high compliance costs and disclosure fatigue for consumers.",
                        "The industry commenters recommending elimination of the short form asserted that it was redundant of the long form, which they argued would be sufficient alone by virtue of it providing a complete disclosure of fees. The program manager recommended combining the short form and the long form to create a single comprehensive pre-acquisition disclosure. The industry commenters critical of the long form variously asserted that it was redundant of the short form and other disclosures required by Regulation E before a consumer can use the prepaid card (i.e., initial disclosures) and State-required disclosures for some payroll card accounts; inferior to the short form, which would provide the most pertinent and common fees; and would overload and confuse consumers with its comprehensive information and therefore not contribute to consumer purchase decisions. An issuing bank, a program manager, a trade association, and a group of members of Congress recommended against requiring the long form, arguing that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated consumers would not use it to make pre-acquisition decisions. Several industry commenters opposed required disclosure of optional incidental services that are not available at the time of purchase; rather, they suggested those fees should not have to be disclosed until such services are accepted by the consumer.",
                        "A number of industry commenters and a State government agency recommended that the Bureau eliminate the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts or, alternatively, treat the short form disclosure for these accounts differently from those for GPR cards. Some of these commenters said otherwise these disclosures would be burdensome for financial institutions providing payroll (and government benefit) cards for a number of reasons. They said the proposed disclosures were, in their opinion, duplicative of the initial disclosures required by \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) and that the differences between payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) and GPR cards militate against requiring a short form disclosure for the former. They said that, compared to GPR cards, these accounts have fewer fees, features, and conditions, and the statement regarding registration and many specific fees listed in the static portion of the proposed short form are inapplicable. They also pointed to State-required disclosure of certain fee discounts and waivers for these accounts as another distinguishing factor from GPR cards. Some commenters said the proposed disclosures were inapt for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) as there are not the same space constraints as there are for GPR cards sold at retail and, further, consumers cannot comparison shop for these kinds of accounts. Finally, some commenters requested that the Bureau eliminate the long form disclosure for these types of accounts as they said it would be redundant of the short form disclosure and the prepaid account agreement; they also suggested that the long form disclosure could be provided post-acquisition or at the time of registration or activation in the payroll (and government benefit) context.",
                        "Rather than eliminating the short form disclosure altogether for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts), some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau eliminate certain short form requirements, such as the registration statement which would be inapplicable for these products.\n          On the other hand, other industry commenters recommended permitting additional disclosures on the short form, such as disclosure of State-required methods to access wages without incurring fees. Some recommended requiring disclosure of all fees on the payroll card account (and government benefit account) short form disclosure as these accounts generally have fewer fees, thereby allowing room for full fee disclosure.",
                        "Similarly, some industry commenters argued that differences in other types of prepaid accounts necessitated greater flexibility in the content and delivery requirements for the short form disclosure. For example, some industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, and a trade association, recommended that the Bureau exclude non-reloadable prepaid products from the proposed disclosure regime, or at least from certain disclosure requirements such as those regarding registration and eligibility for FDIC insurance. Some industry commenters suggested that requiring standardized disclosures for these products would be of limited use to consumers given how the products are meant to be used, and would come at a prohibitively high cost for issuers; several suggested the burden of complying with the proposed disclosure requirements\u2014for example, the requirement to calculate incidence-based fees\u2014may lead to the removal of certain of these products from market. These commenters suggested instead that the Bureau create a separate disclosure regime for non-reloadable cards, similar to the treatment of loyalty, award, and promotional gift card products under the Gift Card Rule.",
                        "Likewise, several trade associations and a provider of digital wallets urged the Bureau not to sweep innovative financial services, such as digital wallets, into a disclosure regime they felt was designed for a specific type of product (i.e., GPR cards sold at retail) based on how it functioned at a fixed point in time. Specifically, the digital wallet provider argued that disclosures cannot be standardized effectively across industries as diverse as digital wallets and GPR cards. In addition, the commenter stated that current digital wallet models do not charge any fees for general usage. As such, the proposed short form disclosure's top-line fees would all be disclosed as $0 or N/A, which it said could potentially confuse consumers and cause them to abandon the digital wallet sign-up process. The commenter also noted that, because consumers are not likely to comparison shop between digital wallets and GPR cards, it believed the comparison shopping benefit of the short form disclosure would be inapplicable to digital wallets.",
                        "A payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers criticized the proposal for not providing a method for updating or curing outdated pricing, which it said issuers may typically accomplish through disclosures and consumer consent at registration, or at a later point in the customer relationship through a Regulation E change-in-terms notice. The payment network suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor and allow financial institutions to keep existing physical cards stocked at retail locations and notify consumers of any changes either by sending change-in-terms notices or by obtaining consumer consent upon registration. This commenter added that this approach would both cure outdated pricing on card packaging and also allow financial institutions to introduce new features that have a fee.",
                        "While consumer groups generally supported the proposed disclosures, they also asserted some criticisms focused primarily on requesting that the Bureau prohibit certain fees, add certain information to either or both the short form and long form disclosures, and eliminate the proposed short form disclosure for multiple service plans. A few consumer groups also recommended enhancing the disclosures with visual aids, such as an image of a piggy bank to denote that an account offers a savings feature."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting a disclosure regime in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b), under which financial institutions must generally provide both a short form and a long form disclosure before consumers acquire prepaid accounts. The final rule generally retains the content, formatting, and delivery requirements of the short form and long form disclosures as proposed, but includes substantial refinements to some individual elements and numerous smaller changes in response to information received through comments received on the proposal, the interagency consultation process, further consumer testing, and other research and analysis. The Bureau believes the final rule's disclosure requirements will achieve the desired results of providing consumers with a succinct and engaging overview of crucial information in the short form disclosure and an unabridged reference for all fees and other crucial information in the long form disclosure.",
                        "The Bureau has also made substantial organizational changes to the structure of the final rule to facilitate understanding and compliance. The Bureau also has incorporated certain burden-reducing measures to address various concerns raised by commenters about the burden on industry they asserted would result from the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime. The analysis of costs and benefits in part VII.E.1 as well as the section-by-section analyses below both contain discussion of provisions adopted in this final rule that are aimed at reducing burden on industry relative to the proposal. These burden-alleviating modifications include the various changes to the additional fee types disclosures, including disclosure of two fees rather than three; a de minimis threshold; and reassessment and updating required every 24 months rather than 12. Other measures in the final rule that reduce burden include permitting reference in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) to State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B); permitting disclosure of the long form within other disclosures required by Regulation E pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(iii); and flexible updating of third-party fees pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii).",
                        "Although some industry commenters suggested that the competitive nature of the prepaid market forecloses the need for disclosure regulation, the Bureau believes both consumers and industry are better served by disclosure regulations carefully calibrated to balance the needs and concerns of all parties.",
                        "The Bureau is issuing the final rule pursuant to EFTA section 904(a), (b), and (c), and 905(a) and 913(2), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(xiv), (b)(4)(ii), and (b)(9), the Bureau believes that adjustment of the timing and fee requirements and the disclosure language is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts. In addition, the Bureau believes that pre-acquisition disclosures of all fees for prepaid accounts as well as certain foreign language disclosures will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.",
                        "Short form and long form disclosures generally. As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes the short form and long form disclosures both play crucial but distinct roles. Eliminating one or both would defeat the overall purpose of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime to provide consumers with comprehensible information to make reasoned purchase and use decisions with regard to their prepaid accounts. The short form discloses key fees and information to consumers in a standardized visual hierarchy that lends itself to comparison shopping prior to purchase and provides a handy summary post-purchase; the long form provides a comprehensive location for all fees and other information that a consumer may consult both prior to and after purchase. In the absence of such a disclosure regime, consumers have scant opportunity to see all fees prior to purchase or to quickly assess the relative benefits of one prepaid account over another.",
                        "Specifically, the Bureau believes that by prominently displaying key fees with limited explanatory text, the short form enhances consumers' ability to notice these key fees and enables them to use the disclosure to inform their acquisition choice. The Bureau also believes that the short form's design, and in particular the emphasized top-line portion of the disclosure, creates a visual hierarchy of information that will more effectively draw consumers' attention to a prepaid account's key terms. The Bureau also believes the general visual hierarchy as well as the relatively spare content of the short form increases the likelihood that consumers will engage with the disclosure.",
                        "The Bureau understands that, faced with the disclosures in the current marketplace, consumers may spend little time reviewing fee disclosures, particularly when shopping for prepaid accounts in person. The Bureau believes it is therefore important to provide a disclosure that quickly draws consumers' attention to the most important information regarding that particular account with minimal clutter on the form. For this reason, the Bureau designed and developed the short form as a concise snapshot of a prepaid account's key fees and features that is both easily noticeable and digestible by consumers. Relatedly, the Bureau also believes that the overall standardization of the short form disclosure will facilitate consumers' ability to comparison shop among prepaid account programs. The standardization of the static fee components of the short form disclosure ensures that consumers will be provided certain key fee information about prepaid accounts in a consistent manner regardless of how or where they shop for or obtain prepaid accounts. For example, under the final rule, a consumer who takes a package containing a prepaid account access device off of a J-hook in a retail location would see the same fee disclosures in the static portion of the short form as that consumer would see if shopping online for a prepaid account. Similarly, the standardization of the informational statements at the bottom of the short form permits that consumer to easily compare, for example, whether the prepaid accounts are eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance.",
                        "The Bureau believes that consumers offered payroll card accounts at their place of employment can also benefit from this standardization because, even though they cannot comparison shop among payroll card accounts, they can make meaningful comparisons with a prepaid account they may already have or with one they may choose to acquire in lieu of the payroll card account. Moreover, the straightforward standardized format of the short form can enhance consumers' comprehension of the key terms of the payroll card account if they do choose to acquire it. In sum, the Bureau believes that standardizing the short form disclosure across all possible acquisition channels will enhance consumer understanding of the terms of all prepaid accounts and make it easier for consumers to choose the prepaid account that best meets their needs.",
                        "The Bureau recognizes that providing only a subset of a prepaid account program's fee information on the short form might not provide all consumers with the information they need to make fully-informed acquisition decisions. For this reason, the new disclosure regime also requires the long form disclosure to be provided as a companion disclosure to the short form, offering a comprehensive repository of all of a prepaid account's fees and the conditions under which those fees could be imposed. The long form disclosure also provides detailed explanations to consumers about conditions that may cause fees to vary, such as the impact of crossing a threshold number of transactions or specific waivers and discounts. Such explanations are generally not permitted on the short form to preserve its simplicity, but may be relevant to some consumers' acquisition decisions.",
                        "The Bureau expects that consumers will use the long form if they want to review a comprehensive list of fees before choosing to acquire a prepaid account and learn details about the fees listed on the short form. In sum, the short form and the long form used alone or in tandem provide consumers with either or both an overview of the key information about the prepaid account and an unabridged list of fees and conditions and other important information.",
                        "The Bureau believes that providing both disclosures is more beneficial than either form standing alone, and the Bureau does not believe that providing only the long form would be satisfactory. The Bureau understands that the potential size and complexity of the long form could lead consumers to disregard the disclosure in some settings, such as in retail locations where consumers are shopping while standing up, and not use it to comparison shop across products or even to evaluate a single product. However, in the Bureau's pre-proposal testing of a simulated purchase environment, some participants indicated they would use information found only in the long form disclosure, i.e., information absent from the short form disclosure, in making their purchase decisions.\n          Thus, insofar as the subset of fee information on the short form disclosure may be incomplete or insufficient for some consumers, the Bureau believes that providing both the short form and long form disclosures will strike the right balance between giving consumers key information about a prepaid account to aid understanding and comparison shopping, while also providing them with the opportunity to review all of a prepaid account's fee information pre-acquisition.",
                        "Disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts. The Bureau declines, as requested by some commenters, to eliminate the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts or, alternatively, create a short form disclosure specifically for these accounts, for several reasons. First, the short form disclosure provides an opportunity to clearly and conspicuously inform consumers of their wage and benefit payment rights under the compulsory use prohibition in EFTA section 913 and \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2), which the Bureau believes is key information for consumers. If the short form disclosure were eliminated and this statement was moved to the long form disclosure, for example, the Bureau believes it likely this information would be obscured by the relatively increased length and complexity of the long form disclosure and thereby deprive consumers of an opportunity to be informed of this crucial statutory right.",
                        "Second, the short form disclosure is important because consumers may be more likely to view it than the long form disclosure. The short form disclosure was designed to showcase information the Bureau believes is most important to consumers in their general prepaid account purchase and use decisions and such information is intended to complement the information disclosed in the more detailed long form. Pre-proposal testing indicated that consumers would prefer the short form over the long form when shopping for a prepaid card in certain environments, such as at retail while standing up.\n          The Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from receiving the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts in that consumers may receive multiple pieces of written information at the beginning of a new job or when applying for government benefits, that may compete for the consumer's attention. Thus, even if consumers do not look at the long form disclosure before choosing to receive wages or benefits via the account, they may at least see information about key fees and features of the account on the short form disclosure.",
                        "Third, while employees cannot comparison shop among payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, the short form disclosure provides a convenient way to compare key fees and features with the consumer's own prepaid account (if they have one) and, perhaps at a later time, with other prepaid accounts. Consumers may also use the short form disclosure to quickly assess the relative advantage of receiving their wages (or benefits) via the account versus other payment methods, such as direct deposit to a bank account or by check. In sum, while the consumer may not comparison shop among payroll card accounts (or government benefit accounts), the short form disclosure nevertheless provides important comparison opportunities for consumers offered payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts).",
                        "Finally, while the Bureau understands that some payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) currently charge fewer fees and offer fewer features than GPR cards, requiring the short form disclosure in this context ensures that consumers know that certain features and services are free or unavailable and further, it ensures they will be apprised of the charges for any new fees the payroll (or government benefit) industry may impose on such accounts in the future.",
                        "Disclosures for non-reloadable cards and digital wallets. The Bureau also considered the comments requesting exemption from the short form disclosure requirements for non-reloadable cards and digital wallets, but declines such exemption in the final rule. The Bureau believes consumers who buy these product types will benefit from the short form disclosure. As discussed above with respect to payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, the short form disclosure was designed to showcase information participants identified in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as key to their general prepaid account purchase and use decision-making; such information is intended to complement the information disclosed in the more detailed long form. In addition, the Bureau is concerned that creating an individualized disclosure regime for different types of prepaid accounts could create a patchwork regulatory regime, which is one of the results this rule seeks to prevent.",
                        "With respect to the request to exempt digital wallets from the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements (particularly the short form), the Bureau believes consumers of digital wallets should have the same opportunity to review fees (or lack thereof) in the short form disclosure as consumers of other prepaid accounts. While the majority of digital wallet models currently on the market may not charge usage fees, as one commenter asserted, this may not hold true in the future, especially if these products become more widely used and the features and services offered broaden. The Bureau is also not persuaded that there are sufficient factors distinguishing digital wallets from other types of prepaid accounts that are marketed or available for acquisition electronically. The Bureau is skeptical that the technical and other constraints suggested by commenters would impact the ability of digital wallets to provide pre-acquisition disclosures. The Bureau is not persuaded, therefore, that a convincing policy rationale exists for treating digital wallets differently than other prepaid accounts with regard to pre-acquisition disclosures.",
                        "Changes in terms and addition of new EFT services. The Bureau understands financial institutions do not change the fee schedules for most prepaid accounts often, especially for prepaid products distributed in person, such as GPR cards and similar products sold at retail, because a financial institution may need to pull and replace outdated card packaging when making changes to those programs' disclosed fee structures. Financial institutions' reasons for pulling and replacing may include compliance with legal requirements under operative State consumer protection and contract laws, difficulties that may arise in attempting to provide notice of changed terms to consumers, as well as financial institutions' concerns about being accused of deceptive advertising practices by selling products with inaccurate disclosures. The Bureau encourages the practice of pulling and replacing when making significant changes to prepaid account programs, as it believes that doing so will facilitate consumer understanding of the products they are purchasing and reduce risk to the financial institution of litigation or regulatory claims of deception.",
                        "Two industry commenters, however, stated that financial institutions also sometimes make changes either through disclosures and consumer consent at registration, or at a later point in the customer relationship through a Regulation E change-in-terms notice. The Bureau recognizes that Regulation E provides a system for notifying existing customers of changes in terms to existing accounts, set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a). The Bureau believes that in some circumstances, such procedures may also provide an appropriate means to notify new customers of changes to recently acquired prepaid accounts.",
                        "The Bureau also notes that Regulation E also provides a means, separate from a change-in-terms notice, for financial institutions to notify consumers of terms associated with a new EFT service that is added to a consumer's account, in \u00a7\u20091005.7(c).\n          The Bureau believes that such procedures are appropriate in circumstances where a financial institution is, for example, making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program. In such a circumstance, financial institutions do not need to pull and replace card packaging that does not disclose that new optional feature, even though a long form disclosure that may be provided inside the card packaging pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A), the number of additional fee types pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii), and the listing of additional fee types pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) may be incomplete or inaccurate due to the addition of that service. Instead, a financial institution may provide to new customers disclosures for the addition of the new service in accordance with \u00a7\u20091005.7(c) post-acquisition. The Bureau expects, however, that financial institutions will keep their other disclosures up to date (including those provided electronically and orally, as well as disclosures provided in writing that are not a part of pre-printed packaging materials, such as those printed by a financial institution upon a consumer's request).",
                        "Other requests by commenters. In response to the consumer groups requesting the addition of visual aids to the disclosures, the Bureau believes that there is insufficient space in the short form to accommodate such visuals and that the length and detail of the information in the long form disclosure obviate the need for such additional requirements there.",
                        "With regard to comments from some consumer group commenters and the office of a State Attorney General recommending prohibition of certain fees, such requests are outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Bureau intends to monitor compliance with this rule as well as developments in the prepaid market in general, and will consider additional action in future rulemakings if necessary."

                        "Before proposing the pre-acquisition disclosure regime that the Bureau is adopting in this final rule, the Bureau considered and rejected two alternative approaches. As discussed in the proposal, an \u201call-in\u201d approach would have disclosed a single monthly cost for using a particular prepaid account.\n          Proponents of this approach said it would provide a quick and understandable reference point and, as compared to a disclosure listing several different numbers with line items for each fee type, could also allow for easier comparisons among prepaid account programs. The Bureau also considered the \u201ccategory heading\u201d approach which would have featured a short form disclosure with category headings based on the function for which a consumer would use the service associated with each fee, a format that many prepaid account providers have already adopted, in lieu of the top-line fee type format the Bureau is adopting in this final rule.\n          The proposal included a discussion of the justification for the Bureau's rejection of these two alternative approaches in favor of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime that the Bureau proposed and is now adopting in this final rule.",
                        "The Bureau received few comments regarding these rejected alternatives. Two program managers expressed their support for the Bureau's decision to reject both the \u201call-in\u201d and \u201ccategory heading\u201d approaches for the reasons the Bureau set forth in the proposal and an issuing bank supported the Bureau's reasoning for avoiding the all-in approach. One of the program managers noted that use of payroll cards varies significantly both by individual consumer and the specific employer's payroll card account program. On the other hand, two consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau reconsider the feasibility of the \u201call-in\u201d approach. While acknowledging the Bureau's valid concerns about determining typical usage costs given the wide variety of consumer use, they said that providing through the short form disclosure the estimated cost of typical use of a specific prepaid account would help the minority of consumers who are \u201cintensive users\u201d of prepaid accounts and use them essentially as a substitute for checking accounts. They recommended that the Bureau require financial institutions to analyze the distribution of accountholders' actual total expenses and identify total expenses at the 25th and 75th percentiles of distribution. They said this analysis would show that consumers who use a specific prepaid account product frequently for routine financial transactions would be likely to incur costs within a concrete range.",
                        "For the reasons the Bureau declined to embrace the \u201call-in\u201d and \u201ccategory heading\u201d approaches in the proposal, the Bureau also has rejected these approaches in the final rule in favor of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime described above and throughout this final rule. As discussed in more detail in the proposal\u2009\n          and acknowledged by the consumer groups recommending the \u201call-in\u201d approach, the Bureau continues to question the viability of developing a single formula that accurately reflects typical consumer use of a particular prepaid account program, including how to decide which fee types to include in such a formula and in view of studies indicating there are numerous use cases for prepaid accounts, particularly GPR cards.\n          Moreover, a prepaid account that might have a higher cost under such a formula adopted by the Bureau may actually be less costly for certain consumers, depending on how they use the prepaid account. For example, a formula that included ATM withdrawal fees would disclose an \u201call-in\u201d fee not germane to consumers who do not withdraw cash via an ATM. The Bureau is concerned that such a result may be confusing to consumers. The Bureau also believes that an explanation of the methodology used to calculate the \u201call-in\u201d disclosure would disturb the balance in the short form of the most important information for consumers and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension. Thus, the Bureau has concluded that an \u201call-in\u201d disclosure would be of limited utility and could even mislead consumers, and declines to adopt such a disclosure in this final rule.",
                        "The Bureau also continues to believe the use of the \u201ccategory heading\u201d approach would not be appropriate because the headings would take up valuable space in the short form disclosure that would limit disclosure of other, more important information, particularly for headings under which there would only be disclosed one fee. Also, as discussed above, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated that the top-line approach embraced in the proposed and final rules proved effective with consumers and the Bureau does not believe that the short form disclosure could effectively accommodate both approaches together. Finally, pre-proposal testing revealed that participant comprehension of fees and their purposes did not improve with the use of category headings. The Bureau also notes that the less space-restricted long form disclosure, pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), requires the use of subheadings by the categories of function for which a financial institution may impose fees, as illustrated by Sample Form A-10(e). The Bureau thus declines to adopt a \u201ccategory heading\u201d approach for the short form disclosure in this final rule."

See, e.g., \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(iii) and (6). The Bureau is adding new comment 18(b)-1 to provide additional guidance as to the interaction of these \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) disclosure requirements with the E-Sign Act and with other existing provisions within Regulation E. Specifically, comment 18(b)-1 explains that existing \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1) generally requires that disclosures be made in writing; written disclosures may be provided in electronic form in accordance with the E-Sign Act. The comment goes on to say that, because final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) provides that electronic disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent or other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act, \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) addresses certain requirements for written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures separately.

Several commenters expressed concern that issuers would need additional time to comply with the proposed submission and posting requirements pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and (c), respectively, to implement the necessary system and operational changes. These commenters explained that submitting and posting prepaid account agreements would require issuers to develop a process of maintaining inventory for the agreements, create a process to update them on a quarterly basis, and develop a periodic monitoring process to ensure accuracy of these agreements. In addition, these commenters explained that the posting requirement would also require issuers to create a location on their Web sites for the posting of agreements.",
                "The Bureau is adopting an effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule generally, which is reflected in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(1), which states that except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2), the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.19 apply to prepaid accounts beginning on October 1, 2017.",

An issuer must submit to the Bureau no later than October 31, 2017 all prepaid account agreements it offers as of October 1, 2017. The Bureau continues to work to develop a streamlined electronic submission process, which it expects will be fully operational before final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) becomes effective on October 1, 2017. The Bureau expects to provide technical specifications regarding the electronic submission process in advance of that date. Issuers will have no submission obligations under this provision until the Bureau has issued technical specifications addressing the form and manner for submission of agreements.",

After October 1, 2017, issuers must submit on prepaid account agreements or notifications of withdrawn agreements to the Bureau within 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer the agreements.",
                "The Bureau is also adopting new comment 19(f)-2 to explain that, during the delayed agreement submission period set forth in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2), an issuer must post agreements on its Web site as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) and (d)(1)(i) using the agreements it would have otherwise submitted to the Bureau under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and must provide a copy of the consumer's agreement to the consumer upon request pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(d)(1)(ii). For purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(2) and (d)(2), agreements posted by an issuer on its Web site must conform to the form and content requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(6).

Agreements posted pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) would have been required to be accurate and updated whenever changes are made.

                        "Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58(d)(1) requires credit card issuers to update the agreements posted on their Web sites at least as frequently as the quarterly schedule required for submission of agreements to the Bureau, but permits an issuer to update its agreements more frequently if it so chooses. For Regulation Z, the Board considered a consumer group comment requesting that the online agreement be updated within a specific period of time no greater than 72 hours. The Board declined to adopt such a requirement because it believed that the burden to card issuers of updating agreements in such a short time would outweigh the benefit. In addition, the Board noted that if a consumer applies or is solicited for a credit card, the consumer will receive the updated disclosure under existing rules in Regulation Z subpart B.\n          The Bureau believed that prepaid account issuers generally update their agreements posted online as changes are made. The Bureau did not believe that prepaid account issuers would face the same burdens as credit card issuers in updating prepaid account agreements posted online because the terms of such agreements do not vary in the same manner as credit card agreement terms, which may offer a variety of rates and fees depending on the creditworthiness of the consumer. Thus, for prepaid account agreements, the Bureau proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(3) that prepaid account agreements posted only be accurate and that issuers update their agreements whenever changes are made.",
                        "Proposed comment 19(c)-1 would have explained that an issuer's obligation to post and maintain prepaid account agreements on its Web site pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) is distinct from that of \u00a7\u20091005.7, which requires an issuer to provide certain disclosures at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving the consumer's account, as well as the change-in-terms notice required under \u00a7\u20091005.8(a). This requirement would have also been distinct from that of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii), which would have required issuers to make the long form disclosure available to consumers prior to prepaid account acquisition and which, depending on the methods an issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, would have required posting of the long form disclosure on the issuer's Web site. If, for example, an issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4), the issuer would not have been required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c). The issuer would have still been required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(d), discussed below, by posting and maintaining the agreement on the issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the consumer's request. The issuer may have also been required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) online as well, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers.",

Such a third-party Web site would have been deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site would have been able to comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c).",

These commenters explained that the proposed requirement would be problematic for issuers as they would have to constantly update their Web site with new and revised agreements. One of the credit unions argued that the requirement would be an intrusion into its business practices, but also stated that issuers already post agreements online without direction from the Bureau. Several commenters expressed concern that the version of an agreement on the Bureau's Web site might differ from the version on the issuer's Web site, causing consumer confusion.",
                        "Furthermore, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(8) above, several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, urged the Bureau to exclude agreements that are not offered to the public (such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) to post agreements to the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the issuer's Web site, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party\u2014not the consumers\u2014chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. These commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.",
                        "Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General supported a requirement to post all agreements, including agreements that are not offered to the public, on the issuer's public Web site because they believed it would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in better informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by some market participants.",
                        "With respect to publicly posting agreements that are not offered to the public, one consumer group explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once the card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with wage other payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.",
                        "Regarding whether the Bureau should specify a timeframe for updating agreements posted on the issuer's Web site, one credit union requested that the Bureau not designate a timeframe, and one consumer group requested that the Bureau require issuers to post agreements within seven business days of issuing the agreement."

The Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(1) to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the general public from the requirement that issuers post agreements to their publicly available Web sites. In addition, the Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(3) to clarify that an issuer must post on its publicly available Web site and update the posted agreements as frequently as the issuer is required to submit new and amended agreements to the Bureau pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.19(b). The Bureau has also made several minor revisions for clarity and consistency.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe that the general requirement to post prepaid account agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the amounts of the fees assessed against the prepaid accounts. The increased transparency will allow the public and consumers to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. Furthermore, the public posting of agreements will allow consumers to compare the terms and fees among various agreements. In addition, the Bureau does not believe this general requirement will be problematic for issuers, as posting agreements on the issuer's Web site is consistent with industry practice today.",
                        "The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting to the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau understands that issuers of payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other types of accounts whose agreements are not offered to the general public could potentially have thousands of agreements to post and maintain on their publicly available Web sites, which could take a considerable amount of time and resources to set up and maintain without necessarily being easy for consumers to navigate. In addition, the Bureau believes that consumers who use these types of accounts would not likely visit the issuer's general Web site to access their individual agreements. The Bureau notes that issuers of these accounts are still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under \u00a7\u20091005.19(d), discussed below, and to submit the agreements to the Bureau under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) (unless the de minimis exception under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) or the product testing exception under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(5) applies). In contrast, the Bureau believes that there are benefits to consumers and third parties in having agreements not available to the general public posted all in one place on the Bureau's Web site. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(8) above.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing comments 19(c)-1 and -2 generally as proposed, with several modifications for clarity and consistency with the revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) discussed above.",
                        "Final comment 19(c)-1 explains the differences between final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) and other provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.19, as well as other requirements elsewhere in of Regulation E, and clarifies that, for agreements that are not offered to the general public, the issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreements on its publicly available Web site, but is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under \u00a7\u20091005.19(d). This comment also clarifies the requirements for issuers that are not required to submit agreements to the Bureau because they qualify for the de minimis exception under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) or the agreements qualify for the product testing exception under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(5). In addition, this final comment does not contain the proposed explanation that an issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Bureau may be required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) online, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, as the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to include this clarification in commentary.",
                        "Final comment 19(c)-2 explains that, if an issuer offers an agreement to the general public as defined by \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(6), that issuer must post that agreement on a publicly available Web site it maintains. If an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer.

For example, if two financial institutions are involved in issuing a prepaid program, one may have fewer than 3,000 open accounts while the other has more than 3,000 open accounts. It may be difficult to determine whether, for example, the de minimis exception in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) applies in such cases.

The Bureau therefore believed it would be beneficial to clarify which institution would be the prepaid account issuer for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19.

The Bureau has also changed the name of final comment 19(a)(4)-3 from Partner Institution Web sites as proposed to Third-Party Web sites because the content of the comment is primarily related to third-party Web sites; a partner institution Web site is merely an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.19.",

This comment also explains that each issuer may use the program manager to submit the agreement on its behalf, in accordance with final comment 19(a)(4)-2. Because the number and the role of the entities involved in a particular prepaid account agreement may vary, the Bureau believes it is clearer to require issuers, not program managers (or other parties), to submit these agreements to the Bureau. In addition, the Bureau believes that submitting a separate agreement for each issuer, rather than submitting one agreement with multiple issuers listed, as suggested by one commenter, will be less confusing to consumers and other parties reviewing agreements on the Bureau's Web site in the future."

Proposed comment 19(a)(7)-1 would have explained that for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19, a prepaid account includes, among other things, a payroll card account as defined in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(iii) and a government benefit account as defined proposed \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)(iv) and 1005.15(a)(2).",
                "The Bureau received comments from several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, in response to the Bureau's request for comment regarding whether there were any types of prepaid accounts as defined in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3) that should be excluded from the definition of prepaid account for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19, or that should be excluded from certain requirements in \u00a7\u20091005.19. These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the public (such as for payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the Bureau's and issuer's Web sites, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party\u2014not the consumers\u2014chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. The commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.",
                "Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General urged the Bureau not to exclude any prepaid account agreements from the requirement to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters argued that publicly posting these agreements would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in more informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by market participants. This commenter explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once a card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.",

The Bureau is also finalizing comment 19(a)(7)-1, renumbered as comment 19(a)(8)-1, with minor revisions for clarity and an updated internal paragraph citation to reflect numbering changes made in this final rule.",
                "The Bureau believes that the submission of all prepaid account agreements, including payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public, is essential for the Bureau's market monitoring efforts. Furthermore, the Bureau's posting of these agreements to its Web site in the future will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the types and amounts of the fees imposed in these programs. The increased transparency will allow the public, including consumers, to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. In addition, the public posting to the Bureau's Web site in the future will allow entities such as employers, government agencies, and universities considering making prepaid account programs available to their constituencies to review similar agreements with other institutions and compare the various terms before entering into their own agreements. The Bureau also agrees that consumers of accounts with agreements that are not available to the general public, such as payroll card accounts, will be able to make meaningful comparisons with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts. For these reasons, the Bureau declines to exclude payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public from the final rule's submission requirement, as requested by some commenters.",
                "The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting agreements that are not offered to the general public to the issuer's publicly available Web site may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau has thus modified \u00a7\u20091005.19(c), discussed below, to exempt agreements that are not offered to the general public from the posting requirement.

Specifically, these commenters argued that requiring financial institutions to provide the short form, long form, and initial disclosures is redundant and would result in information overload and consumer confusion. One issuing credit union urged the Bureau not to require financial institutions to include the long form disclosure in the initial disclosures, while an issuing bank suggested that the Bureau require the long form disclosure be delivered only as part of the initial disclosures.

The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to adjust the requirement in EFTA section 905(a)(4), which is implemented in existing \u00a7\u20091005.7(b)(5), for prepaid accounts, and its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that disclosure of all fees for prepaid accounts will, consistent with EFTA section 902 and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, and ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with a prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau believes that it is important that the initial account disclosures provided to consumers list all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account. The Bureau believes that because consumers will likely reference these disclosures throughout their ongoing use of their prepaid accounts, it is important that these disclosures include all relevant fee information, not just those fees related to EFTs. In addition, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions are already disclosing all fees in the terms and conditions accompanying prepaid accounts. Regulation DD, which implements the Truth in Savings Act, requires that initial disclosures for deposit accounts include the amount of any fee that may be imposed in connection with the account (or an explanation of how the fee will be determined) and the conditions under which the fee may be imposed.\n          Because some prepaid accounts as defined by this final rule may not also constitute accounts as defined under Regulation DD (or the corresponding regulations applicable to credit unions),\n          final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1) in conjunction with the long form disclosure requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) will ensure that prepaid account consumers receive fee disclosures that include all fees, not just those related to EFTs or the right to make transfers.",
                        "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1) provides that a financial institution must include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7, all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4). The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(f)-1, which clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) for the long form disclosure as part of its initial disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.7; a financial institution may choose to do so, however, in order to satisfy other requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18.\n          The Bureau believes these revisions streamline the proposed language and make clearer the Bureau's intent as to when the long form disclosure itself must be provided.",

Specifically, this provision makes clear that the change-in-terms notice provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) apply to any change in a term or condition that is required to be disclosed under \u00a7\u20091005.7 or final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1). New \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2) also provides, however, that if a financial institution discloses the amount of a third-party fee in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) and initial disclosures pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1), the financial institution is not required to provide a change-in-terms notice solely to reflect a change in that fee amount imposed by the third party.",

New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) requires that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.",
                        "The Bureau believes some institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to apply for or request a covered separate credit feature as described above by providing consumers who do not make such an application or request with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do make such applications or requests. For example, an institution could waive the monthly fee for holding a prepaid account for consumers who apply for or request that a covered separate credit feature be connected to the prepaid account, but not waive the monthly fee for consumers who do not make such an application or request.",
                        "The Bureau is revising the commentary to \u00a7\u20091026.18(g) from the proposal to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-1 provides that new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 defines the term covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau also is adding new comment 18(g)-2.i to provide that new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(ii) defines the term \u201casset feature.\u201d Under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(ii), the term \u201casset feature\u201d means an asset account that is a prepaid account, or an asset subaccount of a prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-2.ii provides that new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) applies to account terms, conditions, and features that apply to the asset feature of the prepaid account. New \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) does not apply to the account terms, conditions, or features that apply to the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether it is structured as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.",

New comment 18(g)-3 provides that under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g), a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account programs. For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes concerns expressed by the consumer group commenter that financial institutions could steer consumers who want to activate a credit feature accessible by a prepaid card that is a credit card to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature. Nonetheless, at this time, the Bureau retains the flexibility for financial institutions to impose different fees on different prepaid account programs. The Bureau will monitor whether financial institutions are structuring prepaid account programs in an attempt to evade the provisions in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g).",

For instance, an institution may not provide a PIN-only card on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, while providing a prepaid card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality for prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program with such a credit feature; (4) minimum balance requirements on the asset feature of the prepaid account; or (5) account features offered in connection with the asset feature of the prepaid account, such as online bill payment services.",

This comment explains that new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. This comment also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature.",

For example, assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account.

The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees that are likely to be triggered is also likely to be different. New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.",

Comment 18(g)-5.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Specifically, comment 18(g)-5.iii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g).",

The Bureau believes that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other deposit accounts or savings accounts from which they can transfer funds to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to per transaction fees imposed on prepaid accounts for transactions that access funds in the prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have a covered separate credit feature. All prepaid accountholders can use prepaid accounts to make transactions that access available funds in the prepaid account, so these types of transactions will be available to all prepaid accountholders.",

                        "For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that many prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other asset accounts, such as checking accounts or savings accounts, or other credit accounts, from which they can draw or transfer asset funds or credit for deposit into the prepaid account outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that load or transfer fees for credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card outside the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a load or transfer fees from an asset account, or non-covered separate credit feature, outside the course of a transaction. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that such direct deposit methods commonly are offered on most types of prepaid accounts and that most prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit feature are able to avail themselves of these methods."

This commenter expressed concern that a financial institution could steer consumers who want to activate such a credit feature to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature.",

The commenter urged the Bureau to add load or transfer fees to this list of fees.

New \u00a7\u20091005.18(g)(1) provides that except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g)(2), with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a financial institution must provide to any prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that have such a credit feature. New \u00a7\u20091005.18(g)(2) provides that a financial institution is not prohibited under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g)(1) from imposing a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge that it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a finance charge to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.",

The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

In implementing its overdraft opt-in rule under \u00a7\u20091005.17, the Board required that \u201c[a] financial institution shall provide to consumers who do not affirmatively consent to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.\u201d\u2009\n          The Board recognized that without this requirement, \u201csome institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to provide affirmative consent to the institution's payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions by providing consumers who do not opt in with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do opt in.\u201d\u2009",
                        "The Bureau believes that a similar requirement should be extended here for similar reasons. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(a)(1) below, a covered separate credit feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's application or specific request and only in compliance with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c). New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) requires that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.",

For example, an institution could waive the monthly fee for holding a prepaid account for consumers who apply for or request that a covered separate credit feature be connected to the prepaid account, but not waive the monthly fee for consumers who do not make such an application or request.",
                        "The Bureau is revising the commentary to \u00a7\u20091026.18(g) from the proposal to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-1 provides that new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 defines the term covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau also is adding new comment 18(g)-2.i to provide that new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(ii) defines the term \u201casset feature.\u201d Under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(ii), the term \u201casset feature\u201d means an asset account that is a prepaid account, or an asset subaccount of a prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-2.ii provides that new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) applies to account terms, conditions, and features that apply to the asset feature of the prepaid account. New \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) does not apply to the account terms, conditions, or features that apply to the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether it is structured as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.",

New comment 18(g)-3 provides that under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g), a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account programs. For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes concerns expressed by the consumer group commenter that financial institutions could steer consumers who want to activate a credit feature accessible by a prepaid card that is a credit card to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature. Nonetheless, at this time, the Bureau retains the flexibility for financial institutions to impose different fees on different prepaid account programs. The Bureau will monitor whether financial institutions are structuring prepaid account programs in an attempt to evade the provisions in new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g).",

For instance, an institution may not provide a PIN-only card on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, while providing a prepaid card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality for prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program with such a credit feature; (4) minimum balance requirements on the asset feature of the prepaid account; or (5) account features offered in connection with the asset feature of the prepaid account, such as online bill payment services.",

New comment 18(g)-5.i provides that with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) only permits a financial institution to charge the same or higher fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a such a credit feature. This comment explains that new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. This comment also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature.",

For example, assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account.

                        "New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv provides additional guidance on the type of fees that are considered comparable fees to fees imposed on prepaid accounts for credit extensions from covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. This guidance is consistent with the guidance provided in Regulation Z comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii and iii with respect to the definition of finance charge in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii).",
                        "In developing these rules, as set forth in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii, the Bureau was conscious that there were two potentially distinct types of credit extensions that could occur on a covered separate credit feature. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees that are likely to be triggered is also likely to be different. New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.",
                        "Credit extensions from the covered separate credit feature within the course of a transaction. Comment 18(g)-5.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Specifically, comment 18(g)-5.iii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g).",
                        "To illustrate these principles, comment 18(g)-5.iii sets forth a set of several examples explaining how new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) applies in situations in which credit is accessed from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "New comment 18(g)-5.iii.A provides the following example: Assume that a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction it pays, regardless of whether the transaction accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, or is paid from credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Also, for purposes of new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge.",
                        "As described in new comment 18(g)-5.iii.B, if the prepaid account issuer in the above example instead charged $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is permitted to charge the higher fee under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature.

                        "Comment 18(g)-5.iii.D provides another example. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (i.e., a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature.

                        "Comment 18(g)-5.iii.E provides the last in this set of examples. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, and charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (i.e., a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the per transaction fee (i.e., the fee of $0.50) to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts on a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted by drawing funds into a prepaid account from some other source (i.e., the fee of $1.25) are not comparable for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g). The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature.

                        "For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that the above standard for determining comparable fees with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will help prevent evasion of the rules set forth in the final rule with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau believes that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other deposit accounts or savings accounts from which they can transfer funds to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to per transaction fees imposed on prepaid accounts for transactions that access funds in the prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have a covered separate credit feature. All prepaid accountholders can use prepaid accounts to make transactions that access available funds in the prepaid account, so these types of transactions will be available to all prepaid accountholders.",

Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides guidance for credit extensions where a consumer draws or transfers credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.

                        "Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides that load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091005.18(g).",
                        "Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides examples to illustrate this guidance. The first example set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.A relates to loads to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature. Specifically, assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature, such as a non-covered separate credit card account, into prepaid accounts that do not have a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (i.e., the fee of $1.25) are compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (i.e., the fee of $0).

The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a separate credit feature is a finance charge under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii).",
                        "As set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.B, a second example relates to a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account. In this second example, assume that a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee for a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, to a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts.

These commenters argued that consumers do not want to receive unsolicited paper notices. A trade association representing credit unions argued that both the annual and periodic notices were unnecessary since the terms of these notices remain static from year to year and could more simply be incorporated into the cardholder agreement.

In addition, the Bureau sought comment on whether a similar restriction on compulsory use should be extended to other types of prepaid accounts (other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts), such as cards used by post-secondary educational institutions for financial aid disbursements or insurance companies to pay out claims."

                        "Requests to clarify whether certain enrollment methods comply with \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2). Two commenters\u2014a program manager of government benefit cards and a State government agency\u2014generally objected to the Bureau's proposal to clarify the application of compulsory use to government agencies. They argued that government agencies should be allowed to require that consumers receive their benefit payments on a prepaid card of the agency's choosing, since doing so allows the agencies to save money by outsourcing the disbursement process and preventing fraud related to false benefits claims. These commenters urged the Bureau to remove proposed comment 10(e)(2)-2. In the alternative, the program manager, along with a payment network and several other State government agency commenters, urged the Bureau to clarify that a covered person complies with \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) by providing the first payment to a government benefit recipient on a prepaid card and, at that time, providing information to the recipient on how to divert or otherwise direct future payments to an account of the his or her choosing. According to these commenters, this enrollment method would allow the financial institution or other person to adopt a single, streamlined on-boarding process for beneficiaries, while still providing consumers with a real\u2014if delayed\u2014choice on how to receive their payments. One State government agency argued that, if the Bureau did not adopt the requested clarification allowing agencies to unilaterally disburse funds onto prepaid cards, the Bureau should delay the rule's effective date with respect to government benefit accounts to allow the agencies to identify and implement the most economical and efficient means of complying with the compulsory use prohibition.",
                        "Other commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, trade associations, a payment network, and an employer that disburses compensation via payroll card accounts, asked the Bureau to address situations\u2014for both government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts\u2014where the consumer is provided a choice but does not make a selection. Specifically, these commenters asked the Bureau to confirm in the final rule that a financial institution or other person complies with the compulsory use prohibition by providing a consumer with two or more alternative methods for receiving funds, and, if the consumer fails to affirmatively select from among the available methods within a prescribed period of time, disbursing the consumer's payment to a pre-selected, default enrollment method, such as a payroll card account or government benefit account. According to these commenters, this method of enrollment is standard practice among many employers and government benefit programs, and is in fact permitted under some State laws. Mandating changes to these existing practices, they argued, would require costly system changes.",
                        "Several consumer group commenters, by contrast, urged the Bureau to clarify that a financial institution or other person that unilaterally enrolls a consumer in a payroll card account or government benefit account program violates the compulsory use prohibition, regardless of whether the person only disburses the consumer's initial payment onto that card or provides the consumer with information about how to divert future payments to an account of the consumer's choosing. In general, these commenters argued that an automatic, unilateral disbursement of a first payment onto a prepaid card is tantamount to a condition that the consumer have an account with a particular institution in order to receive his or her salary or government benefit, in violation of the compulsory use prohibition. Moreover, these commenters argued, default options are \u201csticky,\u201d meaning that once consumers are enrolled in one payment method, they are unlikely to go through the effort to un-enroll or otherwise direct payments to another account. In other words, the commenters asserted, a consumer who continues to receive payments to a payroll card account or government benefit account after being unilaterally enrolled in that card program has not made an affirmative choice to be paid that way. A nonprofit organization representing the interests of restaurant workers provided the Bureau with survey results showing that more than a quarter of employees at a particular restaurant company who responded to the organization's survey reported that they were never told that they had options other than a payroll card account by which to receive their wages. With regards to the possibility of a financial institution's use of a default enrollment method where consumers are provided with a choice of payment method but fail to communicate a preference after a certain period of time, one consumer group indicated that it was not categorically opposed to this practice, but suggested that the period the financial institution should have to wait before enrolling a non-responsive consumer in a default enrollment method should be 30 days or more.",
                        "One consumer group commenter asked the Bureau to go further and require that, in order to comply with the compulsory use prohibitions, a financial institution or other person obtain a consumer's written consent before disbursing the consumer's payment via a payroll card account or government benefit account. Another consumer group argued that the Bureau should mandate a specific waiting period before a consumer was required to make a selection with respect to his or her preferred payment method.",
                        "Requests to expand the scope of \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) beyond payment of salary or government benefit. Although it did not propose alterations to the scope of the compulsory use prohibition, the Bureau did seek comment on whether a similar restriction should be extended to other types of prepaid accounts, as discussed above. In response, numerous consumer group commenters urged the Bureau to expand the compulsory use prohibition to other types of prepaid accounts used by third parties to disburse funds to consumers, including accounts used to disburse student aid or student loans, accounts used to disburse insurance or workers' compensation payments, and accounts used by correctional facilities to disburse funds to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals. The commenters expressed concern that consumers in these circumstances could not otherwise avoid the high fees or restrictive terms and conditions that they allege often accompany such cards, if the consumers must accept the cards to access their funds.",
                        "Several commenters, including several members of Congress, pointed to prison release cards as a particularly troubling example of a prepaid account product that they say comes with high fees and terms and conditions that limit consumers' ability to access their own funds. Funds disbursed onto prison release cards may include prison job wages or public benefits paid to the prisoner while in prison. The commenters argued that consumers who receive these prepaid products should have a choice with respect to how they get paid. In the alternative, the commenters urged the Bureau to limit fees on cards that the consumer has to accept, as well as on cards issued on an unsolicited basis. In response, a commenter that manages several prison release card programs, as well as other \u201ccorrection-related\u201d services submitted a comment disputing the consumer groups' allegations with respect to its programs. This commenter objected to the suggestion that its prepaid products are or should be subject to the compulsory use provision. Among other arguments, the commenter noted that prison release cards are a superior alternative to checks, which are often accompanied by excessive check cashing fees, or cash, which can be mismanaged by correctional staff. This commenter also took issue with the suggestion that its prepaid account programs are accompanied by particularly high fees, noting that State departments of corrections that bid for its services look carefully at the fees charged to card users. The commenter provided fee schedules for several of its programs that it argued show that the programs' cardholder fees are not exorbitant."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting comment 10(e)(2)-2 as proposed with minor modifications for clarity and conformity. The Bureau declines to amend regulatory text or adopt additional commentary as requested by some commenters. The Bureau continues to believe it is important that consumers have a choice with respect to how they receive their salary or government benefits. Whether a financial institution or other person complies with \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2), therefore, depends on whether the financial institution or other person provides the consumer with a choice regarding how to receive his or her payment. For example, a financial institution or other person that mandates that consumers receive their salary or government benefit on a specific prepaid card violates EFTA section 913(2) and \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2), as the statutory and regulatory text make clear. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to revise \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) to allow government agencies to require consumers to receive government benefits on a prepaid card of the agency's choosing, as some commenters requested.",
                        "Likewise, after considering the comments on this issue, the Bureau agrees with consumer group commenters that a financial institution or other person that mandates that a consumer receive the first payment of salary or government benefits on a prepaid card does not give the consumer a choice regarding how to receive the payment, even if the consumer can later re-direct the payment to an account of his or her choice.\n          In such a scenario, the consumer does not have a choice with respect to how to receive the first payment of salary or government benefit; rather, at least with respect to that first payment, the consumer was required to establish an account with the financial institution that issued the prepaid account as a condition of receiving the funds.",
                        "The Bureau does not at this time and on this record believe it would be appropriate to set a bright-line test based solely on amount of time or whether the consumer agrees to the preferred payment method in writing, as some commenters suggested. As the Bureau noted in the proposal, there are many ways a consumer can obtain a prepaid account, and the Bureau believes its disclosure regime should be\u2014and is\u2014adaptable to this variety.\n          The Bureau notes that how long a consumer had to select a preferred payment method may not always be indicative of whether the consumer was given a choice regarding how to receive his payment. For example, a company's policies and procedures may dictate that employees be given at least two weeks to select a preferred payment method. However, such a policy may not help an employee who is ordered by his direct supervisor to accept wages via a payroll card. Likewise, the way a consumer expresses her preferred payment method may not be indicative of whether she exercised a choice with respect to how to receive her payments. Relatedly, as some industry commenters noted, consumers are sometimes given a choice between two or more payment alternatives, but may fail to indicate their preference. Depending on the facts and circumstances\u2014for example, the date by which the consumer has to be paid her wages under State law\u2014it may be reasonable for a financial institution or other person in this scenario to employ a reasonable default enrollment method.",
                        "The Bureau also declines to amend existing regulatory text or adopt additional commentary concerning which alternative payment methods must be made available to a consumer to comply with the compulsory use prohibition. In response to requests for clarification from a member of Congress and an industry commenter on the one hand, and several consumer group commenters on the other, the Bureau notes that the compulsory use prohibition does not amount to a requirement that a financial institution or other person provide a consumer with any particular alternative to a prepaid account. More specifically, \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) does not mandate that a covered person offer a consumer the option of getting paid by paper check (to address concerns from the member of Congress and industry commenter), nor require that one of the payment options made available to the consumer be direct deposit to an account of the consumer's choosing (as the consumer groups requested). Rather, the consumer must not be required to establish a particular account and must be presented with at least one alternative to the prepaid account, which may be a paper check, direct deposit to the consumer's bank account or to her own prepaid account, or some other payment method.",
                        "With respect to the comments recommending that the Bureau expand application of the compulsory use prohibition to other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau has concluded that it would not be appropriate to take such a step at this time. The compulsory use prohibition has been in place and largely unchanged since its adoption in 1978 in EFTA.\n          The Bureau believes it would be inappropriate to alter the application of the prohibition in the manner suggested by commenters in this final rule without additional public participation and information gathering about the specific product types at issue. The Bureau notes that to the extent that student, insurance, or prison release cards are used to disburse consumers' salaries or government benefits, as defined under applicable law, such accounts are already covered by \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(2) and will continue to be so under this final rule. The Bureau notes further that it is continuing to monitor financial institutions' and other persons' practices relating to consumers' lack of choice (including with respect to prepaid accounts that are not subject to the compulsory use prohibitions). Depending on the facts and circumstances, the Bureau may consider whether exercise of the Bureau's authority under title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, including its authority over unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, would be appropriate."

(That discussion provides an overall explanation of the Bureau's approach in this rulemaking to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts, including with respect to changes to Regulation E, the details of which are set forth below.)",
                "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau is adopting a new definition of \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 which sets forth the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z.\n        A prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 is a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i). See also new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(1) and new Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. As set forth in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(1), a prepaid card that is not a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d is not a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z. See also new Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.D.",
                "As discussed in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or business partners. New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate sub-accounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit credit as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as \u201cnon-covered separate credit features,\u201d as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below. Under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.\n        A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                "As part of the Bureau's approach to the regulation of credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts, the Bureau's final rule revises the compulsory use provision of Regulation E, existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1), to make clear that it applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. The Bureau also is providing guidance to explain that incidental credit described in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) is exempt from the compulsory use provisions in Regulation E, similar to checking overdraft services.",
                "EFTA's compulsory use provision, EFTA section 913(1),\n        prohibits any person from conditioning the extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment by means of preauthorized EFTs. As implemented in Regulation E, existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) currently states that \u201c[n]o financial institution or other person may condition an extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment by preauthorized EFTs, except for credit extended under an overdraft credit plan or extended to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account.\u201d The term \u201ccredit\u201d is defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.2(f) to mean the right granted by a financial institution to a consumer to defer payment of debt, incur debt and defer its payment, or purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. The term preauthorized EFT is defined in existing \u00a7\u20091005.2(k) to mean an EFT authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals.",
                "Congress enacted the compulsory use provision to prevent financial institutions that are creditors from mandating repayment of credit by future preauthorized EFTs. Were the compulsory use provision not to exist, creditors could access consumers' available funds at the same institution via direct transfers, or at other institutions via recurring ACH transfers, to repay the debt. By doing so, consumers could lose access to these funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts, as a creditor could compel the consumer to grant the creditor preauthorized transfer access to the consumer's asset account as a condition for agreeing to provide credit to that consumer.",
                "In adopting what is now existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) in 1981 to implement EFTA section 913(1), the Board used its EFTA exception authority to exclude overdraft credit plans from the general compulsory use rule of EFTA section 913(1)."

For example, if the consumer writes a check that accesses a credit card plan as discussed above, the resulting credit would be subject to the prohibition in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) since it is incurred through a credit card plan, even though the consumer did not use an associated credit card.",

Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have cross-referenced Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i), proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F to explain that a prepaid card is not a credit card under Regulation Z if the access device only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Thus, under the proposal, the prohibition in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) would not have applied to credit extended in connection with a prepaid account under an overdraft credit plan that is not a credit card account. Under the proposal, an overdraft credit plan would not have been a credit card account if it would have been accessed only by a prepaid card that only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.",
                        "Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also would have explained the connection between the prohibition in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) on the compulsory use of preauthorized EFT to repay credit extended under a credit plan accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, and the prohibition on offsets by credit card issuers in proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d). Under existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(1), a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.",
                        "Under proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards, a card issuer generally would not have been prohibited from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the creditor does not make such deductions to the plan more frequently than once per calendar month. Therefore, a card issuer for such credit card accounts would have been prohibited under proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account. Under proposed Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards, EFTs pursuant to a plan described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) would have been preauthorized EFTs under existing \u00a7\u20091005.2(k) because such EFTs would be authorized in advance to recur periodically (but could not recur more frequently than once per calendar month). Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i thus would have explained that proposed \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) further restricts the card issuer from requiring payment from a deposit account (including a prepaid account) of credit card balances by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis where the credit card account is accessed by an access device for a prepaid account.",
                        "As a technical revision, the proposal also would have moved existing guidance in existing comment 10(e)(1)-1 related to when financial institutions may provide incentives to consumers to agree to automatic repayment plans to a new proposed comment 10(e)(1)-4; no substantive changes were intended."

These commenters asserted that allowing financial institutions to recoup overdraft balances from incoming credits to the account is the only way for those institutions to mitigate the credit risk caused by overdrafts. These commenters suggested that the Bureau's proposed compulsory use and offset prohibitions, for example, would effectively deny consumers the ability to access short-term credit in connection with prepaid accounts. These concerns about the rule's impact on small-dollar credit are discussed in more detail below in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section.",

                        "Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) as proposed with certain revisions to be consistent with provisions in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 for when a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z.\n          Specifically, the Bureau has modified existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) to provide that the overdraft credit plan exception in existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) does not apply to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. As discussed above, under the final rule, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)).",
                        "Consistent with the intent of the proposal, the Bureau has revised existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 which relates to the exception for overdraft credit plans. The final rule has moved existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 to new comment 10(e)(1)-2.i and revised it to provide that the exception for overdraft credit plans in final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) applies to overdraft credit plans other than for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have referenced guidance on when a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under Regulation Z as proposed, such that the overdraft exception in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) would have still applied to credit accessed by those prepaid cards. The final rule moves this guidance to final comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii and revises it as discussed below.",
                        "In addition, the Bureau is finalizing the other guidance in proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3, renumbered as new comment 10(e)(1)-3.i, with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Specifically, final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i explains that under final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1), creditors may not require by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis repayment of credit extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Consistent with the proposal, final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also clarifies that the prohibition in final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) applies to any credit extended under such a credit feature, including preauthorized checks. Final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also cross-references new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 and new comment 61(a)(1)-3, which provide guidance related to the credit extended under a covered separate credit feature by use of a preauthorized check on the prepaid account.",
                        "Also, the Bureau has moved the guidance in proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i to new comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii and has revised it to be consistent with new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. New comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii explains the connection between the prohibition in final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) on the compulsory use of preauthorized EFTs to repay credit extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, and the prohibition on offsets by credit card issuers in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d). Specifically, new comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii provides that under existing Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(1), a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.",
                        "Under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61, a card issuer generally is not prohibited from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the card issuer does not make such deductions to the plan more frequently than once per calendar month. A card issuer therefore is prohibited under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a covered separate credit feature from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account. In Regulation E, final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) provides a complementary prohibition on the card issuer from requiring payment from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) of credit card balances of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis.",
                        "Consistent with the proposal, as a technical revision, the Bureau has moved existing guidance in comment 10(e)(1)-1 related to when financial institutions may provide incentives to consumers to agree to automatic repayment plans to a new comment 10(e)(1)-4; no substantive change is intended.",
                        "Consistent with the statutory text and purposes of EFTA, the Bureau is not extending the exception for overdraft credit plans currently in \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. The purposes of EFTA are to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers participating in EFT systems and to provide individual consumer rights.\n          Further, EFTA's legislative history states that the EFTA compulsory use provision is designed to assure that \u201cEFT develops in an atmosphere of free choice for the consumer.\u201d\u2009\n          The Bureau believes its final rule, which does not extend Regulation E's existing exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, should ensure that consumers have choice when deciding whether and how to link their prepaid accounts to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and have control over the funds in their prepaid accounts if and when such a link is established.",
                        "As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii), 1026.7(b)(11), and 1026.12(d) below, the Bureau also believes that not extending the exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards is consistent with the purposes of and provisions in TILA. In particular, TILA section 169 prohibits offsets by credit card issuers.\n          In addition, TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) require that for credit card accounts under an open-end consumer credit plan, payment due dates\u2014which must be the same date each month\u2014must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement.\n          In addition, TILA section 163 provides that, for credit card accounts under an open-end consumer credit plan, a card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that: (1) Periodic statements for those accounts are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the Regulation Z statement as discussed above; and (2) the card issuer does not treat as late for any purpose a required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the Regulation Z periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment.",
                        "In particular, the Bureau believes that the revisions to existing \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) complement the offset prohibition and the periodic statement requirements in Regulation Z by helping to ensure that consumers do not lose access to prepaid account funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts, one of the main purposes of EFTA section 913(1), as implemented by final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1). The Bureau is concerned that absent these protections, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers might attempt to avoid the TILA offset prohibition by requiring that all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt under the covered separate credit feature be automatically deducted from the prepaid account to help ensure that the debt is repaid (similar to how overdraft services function today). For example, the Bureau believes that without its revisions to the compulsory use provision, financial institutions might require that prepaid account consumers set up automated payment plans to repay the credit card debt under the covered separate credit feature and set the payment due date each month to align with the expected date of incoming deposits to the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that this type of payment arrangement would undermine the purposes of EFTA section 913(1), as implemented by final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1), which is designed to help ensure that consumers do not lose access to account funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to extend the exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.",
                        "To the extent that the Board justified its original treatment of overdraft credit plans as providing benefits to consumers from automatic payment, the Bureau notes that under this final rule consumers would still be allowed to choose to make payments on the covered separate credit features on an automatic basis once per month if they find it beneficial to do so. The Bureau also believes that certain credit card rules in Regulation Z that apply under the final rule to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan will help consumers avoid late payments and excessive late fees with respect to their covered separate credit features. For example, as discussed above, under the final rule, card issuers would be required, under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), to adopt reasonable procedures to ensure that Regulation Z periodic statements for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement. The Bureau believes this will help ensure that consumers have sufficient time after receiving a periodic statement for such a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a payment on that credit feature. Also, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.52(b) and 1026.55 below, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, card issuers are limited in the circumstances in which they could increase interest rates for late payments and are limited in the amount of late fees they could charge to consumers who pay late, as set forth in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.52(b) and 1026.55.",
                        "Credit features not accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.

First, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features.

The final rule also adds new comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii to provide additional guidance on the application of the exception in \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1) with respect to the circumstances described above in which a prepaid card is not a credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. Specifically, new comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii provides that credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions of Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) is considered credit extended pursuant to an overdraft credit plan for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1).

Pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(f), after having acquired a prepaid account orally (or by any other means), a consumer would have received the long form disclosure in the initial disclosures provided for the prepaid account.

The Bureau did, however, believe that providing retainable forms of written and electronic disclosures would be feasible."

The Bureau has added additional specificity to this provision to clarify exceptions to the retainability requirements for certain disclosures permitted or required under the final rule. The Bureau has also added to the final rule a cross-reference to \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1), which generally requires that disclosures provided pursuant to Regulation E be in a form consumers may keep, and conforms the language in the final rule to parallel that of \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1). In addition, as set forth below, the Bureau is adopting revisions to comment 18(b)(3)(ii)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(6)(ii)-1.

                        "The Bureau continues to believe that its modification to the general retainability requirement in Regulation E for oral disclosures (and certain other disclosures) is appropriate, as the Bureau does not believe it would be practicable to provide retainable forms of oral disclosures. The Bureau also notes that the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) and (f)(1) will ensure that even consumers who acquire prepaid accounts orally by telephone or who access the long form disclosure for prepaid accounts sold at retail locations either orally or via SMS will receive the long form disclosure in a retainable format, albeit after they acquire the prepaid account.",
                        "Final comment 18(b)(6)(ii)-1 illustrates the retainability requirement with an example stating that a short form disclosure with a tear strip running through it would not be deemed retainable because use of the tear strip to gain access to the prepaid account access device inside the packaging would destroy part of the short form disclosure. Electronic disclosures are deemed retainable if the consumer is able to print, save, and email the disclosures from the Web site or mobile application on which they are displayed. Therefore, a pop-up window or modal\u2009\n          from which a consumer can only print, save, or email the disclosure by taking a screen shot of it would not satisfy the rule's retainability requirement.",
                        "The Bureau declines to require that electronic disclosures provided via a pop-up window be easily printed, as requested by a consumer group commenter because the Bureau believes such a standard is subjective and may be imprecise. The Bureau also cautions against the use of pop-up windows or modals from which it is difficult for consumers to figure out how to print or to actually print. Providing electronic disclosures in a manner which a consumer is not able to retain them by printing, saving, or emailing would not comply with this final rule and would be contrary to the general retainability requirement for disclosures provided under Regulation E."

                "Specific aspects of this provision, and related commentary, are discussed in turn below.",
                "Two additional fee types. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) requires the disclosure of fee types, rather than individual fees. Requiring financial institutions to disclose additional fee types for both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) should further reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal.\n        First, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) are coordinated such that both provisions require disclosure of additional fee types; therefore industry will use the same criteria to formulate the disclosures for both provisions thus avoiding the cost of maintaining separate rubrics.\n        Second, organizing the disclosures around fee types rather than discrete fees simplifies the organizational process by reducing the number of distinct fee categories financial institutions must track and analyze in determining the disclosure of additional fee types. Third, in response to industry commenters' concerns about how to categorize fee types, final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 lists examples of fee types and the breakdowns of discrete fee variations within fee types that a financial institution may use when determining the disclosures required by both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). The Bureau balanced multiple considerations in compiling this list of examples, including existing industry practices with regard to fee types, the accounting burdens associated with relatively narrower or broader definitions of fee types, and the potential benefits to both industry and consumers in using narrower definitions of fee types to communicate information about specific account features and fees. The Bureau believes the resulting list strikes an appropriate balance by capturing categories and terms employed by the prepaid industry itself that will be most useful to financial institutions and consumers in determining and understanding additional fee types. The Bureau is providing flexibility to financial institutions to fashion appropriate names for other fee types, including fee types for services that do not yet exist in the prepaid marketplace.",
                "The Bureau does not believe the use of fee types will compromise the benefit to consumers of the disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), as suggested by some commenters. While it is true that the additional fee types disclosed will constitute broader categories than disclosure of individual fee types, such as the disclosure of fees for bill payment generally versus a specific fee for regular or expedited delivery of a bill payment, there are benefits and detriments to either approach for both consumers and financial institutions and as discussed above, the Bureau believes the approach in the final rule strikes an appropriate balance. To allow financial institutions flexibility to disclose discrete fee variations, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C), financial institutions with additional fee types with two or fewer fee variations may disclose those fee variations by name and fee amount. Similarly, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) permits financial institutions to disclose fee types of their choice if they have fewer than two fee types that require disclosure under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), thereby creating opportunities for more transparent disclosure to consumers and greater flexibility and control for financial institutions, including the option of highlighting innovative and unique product features or features that financial institutions project may require disclosure by the next reassessment and update deadline.",
                "Also in the final rule, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of two additional fee types pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), rather than three as proposed. The Bureau has made this modification, in part, to create additional space on the short form for other disclosures required by the final rule, such as the statement associated with the alternate disclosure of a variable periodic fee pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(ii). The Bureau also believes some financial institutions will find that this modification will impose less burden on an ongoing basis with respect to recalculation and updates than the rule as proposed would have done. The Bureau does not believe that the disclosure of two additional fee types rather than three will reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure for consumers, especially when balanced with other measures the Bureau has taken in the final rule to inform consumers of other fee types, such as the requirement under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi) to generally disclose two customer service fees (for interactive voice response and live customer service) instead of the highest fee that would have been required under the proposed rule.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-1 clarifies that a prepaid account program that has two fee types that satisfy the criteria in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) must disclose both fees. If a prepaid account program has three or more fee types that potentially satisfy the criteria in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose only the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers. This comment cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1 for guidance regarding the disclosure of additional fee types for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-1 also cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types. To address an industry commenter's concerns regarding categorization of fee types, comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 provides concrete guidance on how to categorize fee types. The comment provides an explanation of the term \u201cfee type\u201d and examples of more than a dozen fee types, along with fee variations within those fee types, that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). In response to the recommendation of one consumer group commenter, this comment provides standardized terms for many fee types, including bill payment. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 explains that commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations may be used as needed for additional fee types and fee variations disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), and offers several example to illustrate this concept.",
                "Highest revenue. Upon consideration of the comments and additional analysis, the Bureau has concluded that determining the disclosure of additional fee types on the basis of revenue is superior to an incidence-based system. The Bureau agrees with consumer group commenters that there may be more merit in alerting consumers to fees from which the financial institution makes the highest revenue, even if those fees impact fewer consumers, rather than lower fees incurred by consumers more frequently. Also, as raised by consumer group commenters, the rule as proposed could incent some financial institutions to reduce the cost of the most common fee types in favor of higher fees on fee types incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges. Moreover, all industry commenters who responded to the issue were neutral as to whether the disclosure should be based on incidence or revenue because they tracked both. To the extent that some financial institutions do not track both, the Bureau believes that it is more likely they track revenue and, regardless, that it will be simpler and more straightforward for financial institutions to calculate fee revenues rather than fee incidence.",
                "The Bureau also believes that there is additional information conveyed in using revenue; namely that a fee type's revenue is a measure of the impact of that fee type on consumers\u2014it is the amount, in dollars, of the cost of that feature to consumers. In contrast, an incidence-based approach could have led to disclosure of fee types that were commonly incurred but had a low impact because the fee amount was low.",
                "Revenue from consumers. The Bureau has included specific reference in the final rule to \u201crevenue from consumers\u201d to assure clarity that the revenue required for calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) is based on fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-3 clarifies that the calculation excludes other revenue sources such as revenue generated from interchange fees and fees paid by entities that sponsor prepaid account programs for financial disbursements (e.g., government agencies and employers). The comment also explains that the calculation excludes third-party fees, unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution.",
                "Assessing revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine disclosure of additional fee types. Some industry commenters said the proposed requirement to calculate incidence-based fees on a program-by-program basis would pose significant cost and burden to them. They explained that some financial institutions administer hundreds or more prepaid account programs, particularly in the payroll and government benefit space, and recommended that financial institutions be permitted to aggregate data rather than analyze the data of each prepaid account program separately. The Bureau continues to believe it is crucial that the additional fee types disclosed to consumers in the short form reflect consumer usage and cost for a particular prepaid account program. However, the Bureau also recognizes that many payroll card account and government benefit account programs may be considered separate programs but share fee schedules and other terms. Because of the potential burden for determining the additional fee disclosures based on fee revenue data separately for programs that all share the same fee schedule, particularly in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefits accounts, the final rule permits financial institutions to make their additional fee types determination based on the fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for a particular prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E).",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-4 explains that, if a financial institution offers more than one prepaid account program, unless the programs share the same fee schedule, the financial institution must consider the fee revenue data separately for each prepaid account program and not consolidate the fee revenue data across prepaid account programs. The comment explains that prepaid account programs are deemed to have the same fee schedules if they charge the same fee amounts, including offering the same fee waivers and fee reductions for the same features. The comment also provides examples of how to assess revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the comment explains that, for multiple service plans disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2), a financial institution must consider revenue across all of those plans in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for that program.",
                "The Bureau notes that, financial institutions disclosing only the default service plan for a prepaid account program offering multiple service plans pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(1) are not required to evaluate revenues or disclose additional fee types under \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) for service plans other than the default service plan.",
                "Exclusions pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3). As clarified in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5, once the financial institution has calculated the fee revenue data for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the appropriate time period, it must remove from consideration the categories excluded pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3) before determining the fee types, if any, that generated the highest revenue.",
                "Exclusion of fee types required to be disclosed elsewhere pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1). Like the proposed rule, the final rule requires financial institutions to exclude from the additional fee types required to be disclosed (and from the number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)) the static fees required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii). A new provision in the final rule, \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5), requires the disclosure of certain information, including any purchase price or activation fee for a prepaid account, outside the short form disclosure. Because purchase price and activation fees will thus always be disclosed for prepaid accounts under the final rule, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary or appropriate for such fees to be potentially disclosed as additional fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), as was proposed, and thus has added an exclusion for those fees as well. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.i provides further clarification regarding the exclusion for fees required to be disclosed elsewhere, including clarification that fee types such as those for international ATM withdrawals and international ATM balance inquiries are not excluded as potential additional fee types.",
                "De minimis exclusion pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2). In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting a de minimis threshold permitting exclusion from the additional fee types required to be disclosed of any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.ii provides two examples illustrating the de minimis exclusion; the second example also cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1. While the Bureau solicited comments on whether the final rule should establish a de minimis threshold for updating the proposed incidence-based fees, some industry commenters recommended a de minimis threshold for the disclosure of such fees in general, which is what the Bureau is adopting in this final rule.",
                "The Bureau understands from some industry commenters that many fees that would have qualified under the proposal as additional fee types neither generate significant revenue nor are charged very frequently, though they often relate to services that certain consumers find valuable. With the de minimis threshold, disclosure of such fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) would not be required, although such fee types would be counted in the total number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii). Even with a de minimis exclusion, the Bureau believes that this disclosure requirement removes the potential incentive for financial institutions to restructure their fee schedules to avoid disclosure on the short form of certain fees from which they garner significant revenue. The short form disclosure likewise still remains dynamic such that it can reflect significant changes in the marketplace and in consumer use patterns over time. The Bureau believes the dynamic disclosures may also be useful to reflect the fees of certain types of prepaid accounts, such as mobile wallets, that are less likely to charge the types of fees that are represented in the static portion of the short form.",
                "Moreover, with a de minimis threshold, this disclosure requirement will impose less burden relative to the proposal on financial institutions whose potential additional fee types fall below the de minimis threshold, as they may but are not required to disclose or update those fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau acknowledges, as pointed out by industry commenters, that some fee types may not be germane to all consumers. The Bureau believes that by applying a de minimis threshold, additional fee types that will not be germane to most consumers are not likely to be required to be disclosed. In response to the consumer group commenter that urged prohibiting any fee so small as to fall below a de minimis threshold, the Bureau states that such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Bureau acknowledges the consumer group commenter's concerns regarding high fees with low incidence, but believes that the de minimis exception, in combination with the disclosure of additional fee types based on revenue, as opposed to incidence, strikes the appropriate balance for the final rule.",
                "After determining that a de minimis exclusion from the requirement to disclose additional fee types would be appropriate, the Bureau considered recent studies as well as information provided by commenters to determine an appropriate threshold. A 2012 study offered statistics on the aggregate fees paid by cardholders to the prepaid issuer, using data from more than 3 million prepaid cards across 15 programs from one issuing bank.\n        For the payroll card programs, approximately 89 percent of the fees (by value) paid by cardholders were from fees that appear to align with those required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form under the final rule.\n        The remaining fees ranged between 1 and 7 percent.\n        The study's fee analysis for the various types of GPR card programs were less instructive, having been evaluated across only three general categories (ATM withdrawal fees, maintenance and origination fees, and transaction and other fees).",
                "A 2014 study evaluated transactions on more than 3 million GPR cards from one program manager over a one-year period in 2011-2012.\n        Approximately 96 percent of the fees (by value) paid by cardholders in these programs were from fees that appear to align with those required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form or outside the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) under the final rule.\n        The remaining fees were 1.5 and 2.5 percent.\n        The Bureau notes that the data used in these studies is at least four years old, while fee structures on prepaid accounts have generally been shifting to be both lower and more simplified in recent years.",
                "The Bureau also received information from several commenters regarding fee revenue for a number of prepaid account programs. These commenters provided data mainly for GPR programs, but the Bureau received some information regarding corporate disbursement cards and non-reloadable cards sold at retail as well. Based on this information, across all of these programs except one, fee revenue from consumers amounted to 97 to 99 percent of fee revenue from fees required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form or outside the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5) under the final rule. Of the remaining fees, fee revenue ranged from 3 percent to a fraction of 1 percent. In the one other program, 79 percent of fee revenue was from fees required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form. Of the remaining fees, one comprised approximately 18 percent of fee revenue, while the others ranged between 1 and 2 percent each.",
                "After considering the requests from commenters for a de minimis exclusion and the information available in studies and provided by commenters, the Bureau believes that a 5 percent threshold is appropriate and offers a clear dividing line between fee types that generate only a small amount of revenue from consumers and those that generate significant revenue and thus are most important to be disclosed to consumers prior to acquisition of a prepaid account. Based on this information, the Bureau believes that this threshold level would facilitate compliance and reduce burden, as requested by industry commenters, because a 5 percent de minimis threshold would exclude a majority of the applicable fees (other than the fees disclosed on the static portion of the short form disclosure or outside the short form disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(5)) that generate a small amount of revenue and would be less germane to consumers. At the same time, the Bureau believes that the 5 percent threshold appropriately tailors the additional fee type disclosure requirement to ensure consumers are alerted to fees that would potentially impose significant costs. In addition, the Bureau believes that the 5 percent threshold helps effectuate the intent of the dynamic portion of the short form disclosure to reflect significant changes in the marketplace and in consumer use patterns over time. The Bureau intends to monitor developments in the market in this area.",

Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.iii clarifies that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)(2), such finance charges are also excluded from the number of additional fee types disclosed.",
                "As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself (i.e., the asset feature of the prepaid account). The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: \u201cYou may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.\u201d Consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from the disclosures regarding additional fees under both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, for more details.",
                "The Bureau notes that the calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types does not include fees that are not imposed with respect to the prepaid account program. For example, any finance charges imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, where such finance charges are imposed on the separate credit account (not on the prepaid account) would not be included as part of the denominator used in calculating whether the two additional fee types that generated the highest revenue from consumers of a particular prepaid account program qualify for the de minimis exclusion in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2)."

However this final rule provision permitting voluntary disclosure of fee types when a financial institution has less than two additional fee types that satisfy the criteria of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) does provide flexibility for some financial institutions with regard to their disclosure of additional fee types. A financial institution that chooses to disclose fee types under this provision will be able to more fully inform consumers of the features of a particular prepaid account.

As discussed above, however, the Bureau is finalizing the requirement to disclose additional fee types because it believes it will bring significant benefit to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau recognizes that certain industry practices already in place as well as modifications the Bureau is making in the final rule serve to ameliorate some of the burden financial institutions face in complying with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers already generally track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the Bureau has attempted to minimize burden on industry by basing the detailed list of examples of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 on fee classifications used in the current prepaid marketplace.",
                "The Bureau also notes that, as discussed above, the final rule permits calculation of additional fee types across prepaid account programs with like fee schedules, such that entities that have multiple programs with identical fee schedules, as may be the case particularly with payroll card account and government benefit account programs, may perform a single assessment for all of the programs sharing the same fee schedule.",

Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1) provides that, for a prepaid account program in effect as of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue for a 24-month period that begins no earlier than October 1, 2016. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1)-1 explains that a prepaid account program that was in existence as of October 1, 2017 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2015 and October 1, 2017. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on October 1, 2017. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2017 to March 30, 2019.",

Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2)-1 provides the example of a financial institution that begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before October 1, 2017. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. The financial institution would take into account the data it had accumulated at the time of its calculation to arrive at the reasonably anticipated additional fee types for the prepaid account program.",
                "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(3) provides that, for a prepaid account program created on or after October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the first 24 months of the program. The Bureau has included these provision in the final rule to set forth detailed requirements for financial institutions regarding the time frame within which and the data from which to calculate the first assessment of additional fee types required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). As illustrated in the example in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1)-1, for prepaid account programs in existence as of the October 1, 2017 effective date of the final rule, the Bureau has built in the additional flexibility of giving financial institutions up to one year, after the 24-month time period from which to draw the data used to calculate the additional fee types, for the financial institution to perform the assessment and prepare its initial short form disclosure. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution with prepaid account programs in existence prior to the effective date with unavailable data by requiring the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 2017. Similarly, for new prepaid account programs created on or after October 1, 2017, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account will generate over the first 24 months of the program.",

Moreover, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law\u2009\n        and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when the a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.",

In response to industry commenters recommending elimination of this disclosure entirely due to the burden of calculating the additional fee types, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers currently track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types and thus, the Bureau does not believe compliance with this requirement will be particularly challenging or burdensome for most financial institutions.",
                "In addition, the Bureau expects that both the de minimis threshold and the change in the reassessment and update timeframes from one year to 24 months will reduce variation over time in the additional fee types that must be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) for each prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule, resulting in fewer instances that financial institutions will be required to make changes to the disclosure of additional fee types on their short form disclosures.",

Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4). In this case, the stale forms would therefore be accurate except for the fact that the disclosure of additional fee types would not reflect the expectations of the financial institution going forward for which fee types will garner the highest revenue from consumers. The Bureau is thus adopting the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) to make clear that a financial institution will not be liable for such a result.",
                "At the same time, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, and that financial institutions may need to pull and replace card packaging in some circumstances anyway.",

The comment also clarifies that a fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change.",

Moreover, the Bureau believes changes in the additional fee types disclosed will occur relatively infrequently because the Bureau understands that financial institutions typically do not revise prepaid account fees often. The Bureau also believes this modification will impose a lower ongoing burden on financial institutions with respect to recalculating and updating additional fee types disclosures in addition to smoothing variations in the additional fee types required to be disclosed.",
                "In response to industry commenters' requests for clarification of the time period within which financial institutions must reassess and update (if applicable) the additional fee types disclosure, the final rule explicitly states that both the reassessment and the update must take place within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4).

                "The Bureau also added additional flexibility to the final rule by expressly permitting financial institutions to carry out the required reassessment and update (if applicable) more frequently than every 24 months. As clarified in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2)-2, a financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its assessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. The comment also explains that if a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment, and provides an example illustrating this concept.",
                "With regard to the provisions regarding fee schedule changes in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3), as discussed above, the Bureau is using a 24-month timeframe to correspond to both the initial additional fee types calculation in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2) and (3) as well as the periodic reassessment in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2).

Moreover, as discussed earlier, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.",

The Bureau believes it is appropriate to include an accommodation in the final rule to address situations where, for example, a financial institution may have to cease offering a particular service for a period of time because of security concerns. The Bureau does not wish such a change due to temporary or exigent circumstances to have negative consequences for financial institutions with respect to their disclosure of additional fee types. Due to the nature of this provision in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a)(2), the Bureau does not expect evasion risk with this accommodation because the Bureau does not foresee any circumstances where it would be appropriate for a financial institution to rely on \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3) to increase a fee amount, add a new fee, or change an existing fee to any amount other than $0.",
                "Similar to the proposed rule, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) provides an update printing exception. The Bureau notes that, despite opposition to the additional fee types disclosure generally by industry commenters these same commenters supported the proposed update printing exception. As stated in the proposed rule, the Bureau recognizes that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to sell prepaid accounts at retail. Thus, in the final rule, the Bureau is permitting financial institutions to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles. With regard to the possibility raised by some commenters that disclosures for the same prepaid account program may have different additional fee types disclosures depending on the medium of the disclosure (i.e., electronic disclosures versus disclosures printed on packaging materials for prepaid accounts sold at retail), the Bureau continues to believe that this discrepancy will not significantly impact a consumer's decision regarding which prepaid account to acquire since consumers will most likely be comparing the disclosures for two distinct products, and not reviewing disclosures side-by-side for the same prepaid account found in different acquisition channels.",
                "While there is a chance that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with significantly out-of-date additional fee types disclosures in retail locations could reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be complex and would be an overly burdensome requirement to impose on financial institutions on an ongoing basis.",
                "While the Bureau is finalizing an update printing exception for the additional fee types disclosure on prepaid account packaging materials, it did not propose, nor is it finalizing, any other specific update requirements with respect to disclosures generally. The Bureau notes that financial institutions generally must ensure all other aspects of pre-acquisition disclosures, whether on packaging materials, online, or provided through other means, are accurate at the time such disclosures are provided to consumers. In this final rule, as in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that a general disclosure update requirement is necessary for other elements of the short form or long form disclosures provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, as a financial institution must continue to honor the fees and terms it discloses to the consumer, at least until such time as it satisfies the change-in-terms requirements as set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.8(b) above for a more detailed discussion of the Bureau's expectations regarding changes in terms and the addition of new EFT services."

                "Many industry commenters recommended that the Bureau eliminate the proposed requirement to disclose incidence-based fees based on the burden those commenters said the disclosure would place on industry, particularly with regard to assessing and updating the additional fee types disclosure. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is finalizing the requirement to disclose additional fee types because it believes it will bring significant benefit to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau recognizes that certain industry practices already in place as well as modifications the Bureau is making in the final rule serve to ameliorate some of the burden financial institutions face in complying with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers already generally track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the Bureau has attempted to minimize burden on industry by basing the detailed list of examples of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 on fee classifications used in the current prepaid marketplace.",
                "The Bureau also notes that, as discussed above, the final rule permits calculation of additional fee types across prepaid account programs with like fee schedules, such that entities that have multiple programs with identical fee schedules, as may be the case particularly with payroll card account and government benefit account programs, may perform a single assessment for all of the programs sharing the same fee schedule.",
                "The specific elements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are discussed in turn below.",
                "Timing of initial assessment of additional fee types disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D). Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1) provides that, for a prepaid account program in effect as of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue for a 24-month period that begins no earlier than October 1, 2016. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1)-1 explains that a prepaid account program that was in existence as of October 1, 2017 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2015 and October 1, 2017. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on October 1, 2017. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2019.",
                "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2) provides that, if a financial institution does not have 24 months of fee revenue data for a particular prepaid account program from which to calculate the additional fee types disclosure in advance of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2)-1 provides the example of a financial institution that begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before October 1, 2017. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. The financial institution would take into account the data it had accumulated at the time of its calculation to arrive at the reasonably anticipated additional fee types for the prepaid account program.",
                "Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(3) provides that, for a prepaid account program created on or after October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the first 24 months of the program. The Bureau has included these provision in the final rule to set forth detailed requirements for financial institutions regarding the time frame within which and the data from which to calculate the first assessment of additional fee types required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). As illustrated in the example in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(1)-1, for prepaid account programs in existence as of the October 1, 2017 effective date of the final rule, the Bureau has built in the additional flexibility of giving financial institutions up to one year, after the 24-month time period from which to draw the data used to calculate the additional fee types, for the financial institution to perform the assessment and prepare its initial short form disclosure. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution with prepaid account programs in existence prior to the effective date with unavailable data by requiring the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 2017. Similarly, for new prepaid account programs created on or after October 1, 2017, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account will generate over the first 24 months of the program.",
                "In response to the industry commenter recommending against the reasonableness standard under which a financial institution must project revenues for prepaid account programs in certain circumstances (in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2) and (3) as well as in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3) discussed below), the Bureau believes that, although financial institutions will not have actual fee revenue data for such products, they nonetheless will have a reasonable expectation as to which fee types will generate the highest revenue.

                "In response to the industry commenters questioning the validity of data collected over the proposed one-year period and recommending that the Bureau expand the proposed time frame from which to calculate data, the Bureau agrees that 24 months of data, rather than the proposed one year, will improve the data set from which financial institutions calculate the additional fee types and thus is modifying the final rule as set forth above. In response to industry commenters recommending elimination of this disclosure entirely due to the burden of calculating the additional fee types, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers currently track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types and thus, the Bureau does not believe compliance with this requirement will be particularly challenging or burdensome for most financial institutions.",
                "In addition, the Bureau expects that both the de minimis threshold and the change in the reassessment and update timeframes from one year to 24 months will reduce variation over time in the additional fee types that must be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) for each prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule, resulting in fewer instances that financial institutions will be required to make changes to the disclosure of additional fee types on their short form disclosures.",

Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2)-2 provides guidance regarding a voluntary reassessment that occurs more frequently than every 24 months, including an example illustrating the concept.",

Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4). In this case, the stale forms would therefore be accurate except for the fact that the disclosure of additional fee types would not reflect the expectations of the financial institution going forward for which fee types will garner the highest revenue from consumers. The Bureau is thus adopting the update printing exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) to make clear that a financial institution will not be liable for such a result.",
                "At the same time, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, and that financial institutions may need to pull and replace card packaging in some circumstances anyway.",

The Bureau does not wish such a change due to temporary or exigent circumstances to have negative consequences for financial institutions with respect to their disclosure of additional fee types. Due to the nature of this provision in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a)(2), the Bureau does not expect evasion risk with this accommodation because the Bureau does not foresee any circumstances where it would be appropriate for a financial institution to rely on \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3) to increase a fee amount, add a new fee, or change an existing fee to any amount other than $0.",
                "Similar to the proposed rule, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) provides an update printing exception. The Bureau notes that, despite opposition to the additional fee types disclosure generally by industry commenters these same commenters supported the proposed update printing exception. As stated in the proposed rule, the Bureau recognizes that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to sell prepaid accounts at retail. Thus, in the final rule, the Bureau is permitting financial institutions to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles. With regard to the possibility raised by some commenters that disclosures for the same prepaid account program may have different additional fee types disclosures depending on the medium of the disclosure (i.e., electronic disclosures versus disclosures printed on packaging materials for prepaid accounts sold at retail), the Bureau continues to believe that this discrepancy will not significantly impact a consumer's decision regarding which prepaid account to acquire since consumers will most likely be comparing the disclosures for two distinct products, and not reviewing disclosures side-by-side for the same prepaid account found in different acquisition channels.",
                "While there is a chance that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with significantly out-of-date additional fee types disclosures in retail locations could reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be complex and would be an overly burdensome requirement to impose on financial institutions on an ongoing basis.",
                "While the Bureau is finalizing an update printing exception for the additional fee types disclosure on prepaid account packaging materials, it did not propose, nor is it finalizing, any other specific update requirements with respect to disclosures generally. The Bureau notes that financial institutions generally must ensure all other aspects of pre-acquisition disclosures, whether on packaging materials, online, or provided through other means, are accurate at the time such disclosures are provided to consumers. In this final rule, as in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that a general disclosure update requirement is necessary for other elements of the short form or long form disclosures provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, as a financial institution must continue to honor the fees and terms it discloses to the consumer, at least until such time as it satisfies the change-in-terms requirements as set forth in \u00a7\u20091005.8(a) and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(2). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.8(b) above for a more detailed discussion of the Bureau's expectations regarding changes in terms and the addition of new EFT services."

                        "The Bureau proposed to extend this existing requirement in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) to prepaid accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and to expand the length of time that online access must cover from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau proposed to extend this time period because it believed that based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, more than 60 days of account history may be, in many cases, beneficial for consumers. While recent account history is important for consumers tracking balances or monitoring for unauthorized transactions, a longer available account history serves a variety of potential purposes. For example, some consumers might need to demonstrate on-time bill payment or to compile year-end data for tax preparation purposes. The Bureau also believed that a consumer may realize during any given year that he or she needs financial records from the prior calendar year and that access to 18 months of prepaid account history would give the consumer six months into the next calendar year. In addition, based on pre-proposal outreach to prepaid account providers and publicly available studies, the Bureau believed that many prepaid accounts provide at least 12 months of account history and that, even if they do not, the cost of extending existing online histories to 18 months would be minimal.",

Similar to the requirement to provide electronic account transaction history, the Bureau proposed to extend this requirement to all prepaid accounts in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) and to expand the length of time for which written history must be provided from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-1, which requires that the account transactions histories provided under existing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) reflect transactions once they have been posted to the account, renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-1. In addition, the Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-2 regarding retainability of electronic account history renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-2.",

Proposed comment 18(c)-3 would have included several examples of requests that exceed the requirements of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) for providing account information and for which a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee.",

If a prepaid account has been open for fewer than 18 months, the financial institution need only provide account information pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, this comment would have explained that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make any account or transaction information available. The proposed comment would have referenced existing comment 9(b)-3, which provides that, with respect to written periodic statements, a financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution."

                        "The Bureau received many comments requesting that it modify the time period that must be covered in a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history. Most consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposal to provide at least 18 months of account transaction history, noting the consumer benefits of having a longer time period and arguing that the impact on industry should be minimal because data storage costs continue to decrease and consumers rarely request copies of their account transaction history. These commenters also argued that\u2014contrary to the Bureau's proposal\u2014financial institutions should not be permitted to charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than the required time period, arguing that it should not cost more to print and mail older information than it is to print and mail newer information.",
                        "A few consumer groups argued, however, that a 24-month time period would be more appropriate than 18 months because consumers could identify seasonal patterns, and April 15 tax filers could access transactions earlier than March 15 of the previous year. One of these commenters explained that it could take months for unauthorized transactions to be recognized and months or years to complete fraud investigations and resolve disputes with third parties. This commenter also stated that 24 months would allow consumers to access a longer period of account history, which would be particularly helpful to consumers who are unable to print or save transaction history on a regular basis. These commenters also requested that written account transaction histories go back at least seven years, which they said would be consistent with some document retention policies, so that consumers who use prepaid accounts as primary transaction accounts could look up older charges in the event of a tax audit or when applying for a mortgage.",
                        "A number of industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations, and program managers, urged the Bureau to shorten the proposed 18-month time period and, relatedly, stated that financial institutions would need longer than the proposed nine-month compliance period to implement the requirement as proposed. These commenters argued that the potential costs to industry would outweigh any consumer benefit, since, in their experience, consumers rarely request 18 months of transaction history and do not currently use account transaction history for tax preparation purposes. Some industry commenters requested a 60-day time period, which they stated would be consistent with the current periodic statement alternative for payroll card accounts and with the error resolution and limited liability notification requirements under Regulation E. Other industry commenters requested a time period of no longer than 12 months, arguing that most financial institutions do not retain more than 12 months of account transaction history in a real-time online format, and therefore, requiring a longer time period would be problematic for financial institutions. These commenters also stated that 12 months would be sufficient for consumers to manage their accounts and would be consistent with consumer expectation. Several other industry commenters requested that the Bureau instead require financial institutions to provide consumers with a copy of their written account transaction history upon request once every 12 months at no cost and then allow financial institutions to charge a reasonable fee for any subsequent requests made during that 12-month time period. One of the credit union commenters argued that the time period to provide account transaction history should be left to the financial institution's discretion.",
                        "Several of these industry commenters argued that maintaining 18 months of account transaction history would result in significant costs to financial institutions. These commenters explained that storing and securing such information would lead to operational costs related to upgrading systems, changing record retention policies and procedures, and training personnel.\n          Several credit union trade associations argued that the proposed time period would be especially problematic for credit unions because they retain limited historical account information in their systems and rely on periodic statements if a member requests information beyond what is in their systems.",
                        "Several industry commenters explained some of the differences between the types of information needed to make available and provide electronic and written account transaction histories and the costs associated with maintaining each. These commenters stated that generally, information in a real-time, online database is necessary to make available electronic account transaction history, and archived information is retrieved to provide written account transaction history that extends beyond the time period retained in the real-time database. These commenters stated that real-time information is usually archived after 12 months of the account being opened or when the account is closed, if sooner, and typically retained for several years. They explained that real-time information is easier to access, but more expensive to maintain than archived information, and archived information is inexpensive to maintain, but can be difficult to access. These commenters therefore concluded that maintaining 18 months of electronic account transaction information would be costly because maintaining that length of real-time information is expensive. These commenters further argued that responding to one-off requests from consumers for 18 months of written account transaction history would also be problematic because archived information, although inexpensive to maintain, is usually restricted to certain personnel or stored with a third-party processor, who typically charges a fee to retrieve the information. These commenters also argued that mailing account transaction histories that cover a time period longer than 60 days would increase printing and mailing costs.",
                        "Despite the costs associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters stated that they would rather provide a longer period of written account transaction history than make available a longer period of electronic account transaction history, given that maintaining electronic history is more expensive. However, because of the cost and complexity associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to begin accumulating data as of the effective date of the final rule (until they have built up to 18 months of accumulated transaction history), rather than requiring financial institutions to make available or provide the full length of account transaction histories as of the effective date, to alleviate some of the compliance burden.",
                        "A few program managers suggested further modifications that they believed would help reduce the costs associated with the proposed periodic statement alternative. Two of these program managers urged the Bureau to allow financial institutions to charge a fee for responding to requests for written account transaction histories. Another requested that the Bureau expressly allow financial institutions to inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than the required time period."

                        "For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) with modifications to revise the time periods a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history must cover. Specifically, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to make available electronic account transaction history that covers at least 12 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account, instead of 18 months as proposed. Final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide written account transaction history that covers at least 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, instead of 18 months as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe that, based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, access to more than 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history will be beneficial to consumers for a variety of reasons, such as monitoring for unauthorized transactions, tracking spending habits, demonstrating on-time bill payment, and compiling year-end data for tax preparation purposes.",
                        "However, based on the response from industry commenters, the Bureau is persuaded that providing 18 months of electronic account transaction history could be particularly burdensome to industry, especially since costs related to retaining electronic history increase as the time period lengthens. The Bureau believes that 12 months of electronic account transaction history is consistent with the length of history consumers expect to access online and should not be problematic for financial institutions since many already provide at least 12 months of account transaction history, as discussed by industry commenters. The Bureau thus believes this revision strikes the appropriate balance between burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for accessing electronic account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii).",
                        "Considering the costs associated with maintaining electronic account transaction history, as discussed by commenters, the Bureau declines at this time to require financial institutions to provide electronic account transaction history covering a time period longer than 12 months. However, under the final rule, consumers will be able to request 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), which the Bureau believes adequately addresses the various scenarios offered by consumer group commenters as to why consumers may need access to a longer period of account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau does not believe that the time period for electronic account transaction histories should be left to the financial institution's discretion, as requested by one commenter, because consistency across the market reduces any potential for consumer confusion and assures that sufficient history is available for all consumers.",
                        "With regard to written account transaction histories, under the final rule, consumers will benefit from having access to two full years of transaction information if needed, without requiring industry to absorb the expense of making that length of information available electronically on an ongoing basis. The Bureau declines to require financial institutions to provide seven years of written account transaction history, as suggested by several commenters. The Bureau believes that 24 months of written history upon request is sufficient to meet the needs of consumers and does not believe it is necessary at this time to require financial institutions to provide an even longer written account history upon request at no cost. Based on information received from industry commenters, the Bureau believes the requirement to provide 24 months of written account transaction history, in conjunction with the requirement to provide 12 months of electronic account transaction history under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii), strikes an appropriate balance in providing consumers with the information necessary to manage their accounts while not imposing undue burden on industry. As explained by these commenters, maintaining archived information, which a financial institution will likely need to retrieve to provide 24 months of written history, is less expensive than retaining the real-time information necessary for making electronic history available online. Moreover, because, as explained by some commenters, many financial institutions already retain several years of archived data and consumers do not typically request long periods of written history, the Bureau does not believe that maintaining, retrieving, and providing 24 months of written history upon request should be particularly burdensome to financial institutions. The Bureau notes that financial institutions are not required to provide written history for a longer period than what the consumer actually wants; a financial institution may, for example, inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than 24 months.",
                        "Furthermore, as explained in the proposal, the Bureau anticipates that, in general, written transaction account histories will be sent the next business day or soon after a financial institution receives the consumer's oral or written request. Financial institutions may also designate a specific telephone number for consumers to call and a specific address for consumers to write to request a written copy of their account transaction history.",
                        "Regarding industry commenters' concerns about the proposed nine-month compliance period, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(1) imposes a general effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule. However, final \u00a7\u20091005.18(h)(3)(i) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) or 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may make available or provide the electronic and written histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) below for additional information about the final rule's effective dates and related accommodations.",
                        "The Bureau received no comments specifically addressing proposed comment 18(c)-1. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-1 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.",
                        "The Bureau received no comments regarding proposed comment 18(c)-2. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-2 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic history required under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-3 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications for consistency with the revised time periods in the regulatory text. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-3 clarifies that financial institutions may charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than 24 months. This comment also provides examples of requests that exceed the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule.",
                        "The Bureau declines at this time to permit financial institutions to charge consumers a fee for providing the written account transaction history required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii), as suggested by some commenters. As with the electronic account transaction history required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii), the Bureau believes it is necessary for consumers to have free access to at least 24 months of written account transaction history to effectively manage their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that charging fees to consumers who make occasional requests for written histories could have a chilling effect on consumers' ability to obtain information about transactions and, thus, to exercise their error resolution rights. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for requesting written account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).",
                        "For the final rule, the Bureau has divided proposed comment 18(c)-4 into two, numbered as final comments 18(c)-4 and -5, to discuss the requirements for electronic and written account transaction history separately. The Bureau is finalizing the portion of comment 18(c)-4 addressing electronic account transaction history, with several modifications. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer explains that if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer states that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any account or transaction information. Given the revised time periods that electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, the Bureau has also removed from final comment 18(c)-4 the references to written account transaction history and, as discussed below, is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain separately the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-4 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.",
                        "Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. Final comment 18(c)-4 also explains that, if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. This comment cross-references comment 9(b)-3.\n          However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to require financial institutions to continue making access to electronic history available for closed and inactive accounts because consumers do not typically expect to access this information electronically once an account is closed or becomes inactive. The Bureau also believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide electronic access for closed and inactive accounts will reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal, and consumers will still have access to such information, if needed, in writing upon request as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii).",
                        "As noted above, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history that had been addressed in proposed comment 18(c)-4. The Bureau is adopting the requirements substantially as proposed, with several minor modifications. Specifically, new comment 18(c)-5 explains that a financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. This comment also clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any written account transaction history pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-5 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity."

The E-Sign Act generally allows the use of electronic records to satisfy any statute, regulation, or rule of law requiring that such information be provided in writing, if a consumer has affirmatively consented to such use and has not withdrawn such consent, and if certain delivery format requirements are met. Before receiving such consent, the E-Sign Act requires financial institutions to make clear to a consumer that the consumer has the option of receiving records in paper form, to specify whether a consumer's consent applies to a specific transaction or throughout the duration of the consumer's relationship with the financial institution, and to inform a consumer of how the consumer could withdraw consent and update information needed to contact the consumer electronically, among other requirements. The E-Sign Act also requires financial institutions to retain records of any disclosures that have been provided to a consumer electronically so that the consumer can access them later.",
                        "When the Bureau issued regulations on remittance transfers in subpart B of Regulation E, the Bureau altered the general requirement to provide disclosures in writing, such that pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.31(a)(2) remittance transfer providers may provide pre-payment disclosures electronically when remittance transfers are requested electronically. Comment 31(a)(2)-1 explains that in such circumstances, the pre-payment disclosures may be provided without regard to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.",
                        "The Bureau similarly proposed to modify Regulation E's default requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts. Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B) would have required a financial institution to provide the short form and long form disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) in electronic form when a consumer acquires a prepaid account through the internet, including via a mobile application. Although the Bureau believed that consumers can best review the terms of a prepaid account before acquiring it when seeing the terms in written form, it recognized that in certain situations, it is not practicable to provide written disclosures. For example, when a consumer acquires a prepaid account via the internet, the Bureau believed that a financial institution could not easily provide written (non-electronic) disclosures to a consumer pre-acquisition.",

In addition, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would have provided that these electronic disclosures need not meet the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. Last, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would have required that disclosures provided to a consumer through a Web site where required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C) and as described in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18 (b)(2)(i)(B)(11) must be made in an electronic form using a machine-readable text format that is accessible via both web browsers and screen readers.",

The Bureau believed that during the pre-acquisition time period for prepaid accounts, it was important for consumers who decide to go online to acquire prepaid accounts to see the relevant disclosures for that prepaid account product in electronic form. The Bureau also said it believes that consumers will often decide whether to acquire a particular prepaid account after doing significant research online, and that if they are not able to see disclosures on the prepaid accounts' Web sites, consumers cannot make an informed acquisition decision. Accordingly, the Bureau believed that, for acquisition of prepaid products via the internet or mobile applications, it would be more appropriate to require financial institutions to provide pre-acquisition disclosures electronically.",

The Bureau did not propose to require such compliance for prepaid accounts that are acquired through the internet or mobile applications. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) only would have required that electronic short form and long form disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired through the internet be provided electronically in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer acquired the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that if a consumer has acquired a prepaid account through a Web site, it is reasonable to expect that the consumer would be able to view electronic disclosures on a Web site, and no E-Sign consent would be necessary. The Bureau also noted in the proposal that the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would apply only to the pre-acquisition disclosure of the short form and long form disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired over the internet or via mobile applications. It would not have altered the application of \u00a7\u20091005.4(a)(1) to prepaid accounts after acquisition nor to any other type of account.",
                        "The Bureau also proposed comment 18(b)(3)(i)(B)-1, which would have explained how to disclose the short form and long form electronically. Specifically, the proposed comment would have explained that a financial institution may, at its option, provide the short form and long form disclosures on the same Web page or on two different Web pages as long as the disclosures were provided in accordance with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(i). The Bureau recognized, as several consumer advocacy group commenters to the Prepaid ANPR stated, that disclosures provided electronically on Web sites may be difficult for consumers to find. Sometimes the disclosures are buried several pages deep or are only accessible to a consumer after the consumer completes some form of registration or otherwise logs onto the Web site. The Bureau generally believed that pre-acquisition disclosures provided on a Web site should be easy to locate, whether they are provided on the same Web page or on two separate pages, as addressed in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1) and proposed comment 18(b)(1)-2.",

The Bureau received no comments regarding the requirement that disclosures be provided in machine-readable text.",
                        "Industry commenters primarily asked for clarification regarding the placement and treatment of the short form and long form disclosures in an online setting. Some commenters indicated that prepaid cards increasingly will be marketed and acquired via the internet, including through mobile applications and wearable devices. Commenters said that the rule, as proposed, did not sufficiently address how to comply when providing the short form and long form disclosures via these electronic delivery methods. One commenter noted that the prescriptive font size and other form and formatting requirements of the proposed rule remove the flexibility to shrink or resize disclosures to fit onto mobile screens, which could result in a confusing and frustrating user experience in which it would be impossible to view the entire disclosure at once without zooming out to a wider view.",
                        "One consumer group supporting the proposed requirement regarding electronic disclosure of the short form and long form urged the Bureau to additionally require that financial institutions also provide the disclosures in writing if they issue physical cards. Another consumer group expressed concern that consumers may not see the electronic disclosures and recommended that the Bureau require they be prominently displayed on financial institutions' Web sites. It also urged the Bureau to adopt specific rules regarding location of the short form and long form disclosures on the financial institution's Web site."

The Bureau has added the requirement that these disclosures be viewable across all screen sizes to clarify that they must be able to be seen by consumers regardless of the electronic method used. The final rule also states that the long form disclosure must be provided electronically through a Web site when a financial institution is offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(1)(ii). The rule also finalizes the proposed requirements that electronic disclosures must be provided in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account, in a responsive form, and using machine-readable text that is accessible via web browsers or mobile applications, as applicable, and via screen readers.

Specifically, the comment states that, for example, if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account via a Web site or mobile application, it would be reasonable to expect that a consumer would be able to access the disclosures required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) on the first page or via a direct link from the first page of the Web site or mobile application or on the first page that discloses the details about the specific prepaid program. The comment also cross-references final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 for additional guidance on placement of the short form and long form disclosures on a Web page.

                        "In response to commenters' concerns discussed above, new comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-2 specifically addresses how to provide the required disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes. The comment clarifies that, in accordance with the requirement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) that electronic disclosures be provided in a responsive form, electronic disclosures provided pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) must be provided in a way that responds to different screen sizes, for example, by stacking elements of the disclosures in a manner that accommodates consumer viewing on smaller screens, while still meeting the other formatting requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7). For example, the disclosures permitted by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or (3)(ii) must take up no more than one additional line of text in the short form disclosure. The comment explains that if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account using a mobile device with a screen too small to accommodate these disclosures on one line of text in accordance with the size requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B), a financial institution is permitted to display the disclosures permitted by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (3)(ii), for example, by stacking those disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes, while still meeting the other formatting requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(7).

Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) would have stated that when a financial institution offers multiple service plans for a particular prepaid account product and each plan has a different fee schedule, the information required in the short form disclosure by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (7) may be provided for each service plan together in one table, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(f), and must include descriptions of each service plan included in the table, using the terms, \u201cPay-as-you-go plan,\u201d \u201cMonthly plan,\u201d \u201cAnnual plan,\u201d or substantially similar terms. Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) would have further stated that when disclosing multiple service plans on one short form, the information that would have been required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8) must only be disclosed once in the table. Alternatively, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) would have permitted a financial institution to disclose the information required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) through (8) for only the service plan in which a consumer is enrolled automatically by default upon acquiring the prepaid account, in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Model Forms A-10(c) or (d). Finally, proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) would have stated that regardless of whether a financial institution discloses fee information for all service plans on one form or chooses only to disclose the service plan in which a consumer is automatically enrolled by default, the disclosures required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(9) through (14) must only be disclosed once.",
                        "As discussed in the proposal and herein, the Bureau believed that it was important for short and long form disclosures to have a standardized format in order to facilitate consumer comparison of multiple products and the ability to understand key fee and service information about a prepaid product. The Bureau also recognized, however, that financial institutions offering multiple service plans on one prepaid account needed flexibility to disclose information about multiple plans to a consumer. The Bureau therefore proposed that financial institutions may use one short form table that discloses the information required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) for each of the service plans to highlight for a consumer that such plans exist. The Bureau explained that, a financial institution, at its option, could also choose to disclose only the service plan in which a consumer is enrolled upon acquiring the prepaid account using the tabular format described in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(A) and note elsewhere on the packaging material or on its Web site the other service plans it offers. The Bureau believed that these options would give financial institutions the flexibility to accommodate disclosure of multiple service plans, while also maintaining the simplicity of the tabular short form and long form designs to facilitate consumers' comparison shopping.",
                        "In the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, some participants were confused by short forms that included multiple service plans similar to the one in proposed Model Form A-10(f). The Bureau therefore also considered proposing that financial institutions must disclose each service plan in a separate short form table instead of allowing financial institutions to disclose all of the plans on one short form. Some participants also were unsure of which service plan applied upon purchase when seeing multiple service plans on one short form, an issue that the Bureau believed may be resolved if a financial institution only discloses the fee schedule for the plan that applies upon a consumer's acquisition of the account. The Bureau thus sought comment on the best way to accommodate prepaid accounts products offering multiple service plans on the short form disclosure while providing accurate and sufficient information to consumers.",
                        "In the proposal, the Bureau also acknowledged that only disclosing the service plan in which a consumer is automatically enrolled by default upon acquiring the prepaid account could potentially conflict with the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) that financial institutions would have to disclose the highest fee for each fee type required to be disclosed in the short form. For example, a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d plan in which a consumer is enrolled upon acquisition might not impose a periodic fee, and thus, could disclose \u201c$0\u201d in the top line of the short form where the periodic fee disclosure would be required. Under such a plan, if consumers were to opt into a monthly plan, however, they could be charged a periodic fee higher than $0. The Bureau therefore also sought comment on whether the disclosure of only the default plan on the short form would be clear or if the Bureau should require that financial institutions always disclose multiple service plans on the short form.",
                        "Proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(2) would have stated that the information required to be disclosed in the long form by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) must be presented for all service plans in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(g). The Bureau believed that the long form disclosure should include all fee information about a prepaid account product, and therefore it should contain the fee schedule for every possible service plan.",
                        "Additionally, the Bureau proposed comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1, which would have provided additional guidance on the proposed definition of multiple service plans. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1 would have stated that the multiple service plan disclosure provisions in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B) apply when a financial institution offers more than one service plan for a particular prepaid account product, and each plan has a different fee schedule. For example, a financial institution might offer a prepaid account product with one service plan where a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee. A financial institution may also offer a prepaid account product with one service plan for consumers who utilize another one of a financial institution's non-prepaid services (e.g., a mobile phone service) and a different plan for consumers who only utilize a financial institution's prepaid account products. Each of these plans would be considered a \u201cservice plan\u201d for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)."

Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule failed to contemplate loyalty programs and thus urged the Bureau to permit use of the multiple service plan short form disclosure for such programs. Commenters also asserted that the rule as proposed would stymie future innovation of new fee plans by limiting use of the multiple service plan short form disclosure to plans already in existence.",
                        "Several consumer groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the multiple service plan short form disclosure. They believed the multiple service plan short form disclosure compared poorly with the general short form disclosure, saying it was too complex and confusing, defeated the comparison-shopping purpose of the short form disclosure, failed to disclose all the information in the short form (such as the two-tier distinction between certain fees, including the in-network and out-of-network ATM withdrawal and balance inquiry fees), and lacked the top-line emphasis on key fees. Some of these groups also expressed concern that financial institutions seeking to minimize emphasis on certain of their fees might use the complexity of the multiple service plan short form disclosure to hide expensive fees, such as by starting with a pay-as-you-go plan with no monthly fee before disclosing higher fees for other plans.",
                        "Some consumer groups suggested that the Bureau require disclosure of the default fee plan in short forms at retail, and require that short form disclosures for the other plans be provided inside the packaging material or at the time the consumer chooses to switch to another fee plan. In other contexts that do not have the same space constraints as retail settings, such as online or at bank branches, consumer groups said the Bureau should require disclosure of separate short forms for each distinct fee plan."

                        "The Bureau had observed that most (though not all) financial institutions currently use some sort of table to disclose fees in their prepaid account agreements, although each institution generally selects different fees to highlight and presents them in different orders. The Bureau also noted that financial institutions implement a variety of formats to present fee information on packaging material in retail stores. Thus, the burden is on consumers to identify the fees that are most important to them and find them across various formats to determine the best product for their needs.",
                        "The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing revealed that few participants researched prepaid accounts before acquisition, particularly when they acquired their accounts in retail stores. The Bureau believed that one of the reasons that consumers do not often engage in comparison shopping is because doing so is not straightforward. At retail, prepaid accounts are often displayed behind counters, close to check-out lanes at ends of aisles, and in other often crowded or difficult to access areas which the Bureau believed can limit careful review of a product's terms. The Bureau believed that financial institutions are more likely to present fee information in a clearer and more complete format for prepaid account products offered online, but, as mentioned above, the format used to display this information varies, making comparison shopping challenging. Although some variation is inevitable because each financial institution offers different services in connection with its prepaid accounts, the Bureau believed that requiring use of a standardized form to disclose fee information would be appropriate to minimize variation in presentation format. Additionally, in the case of the short form disclosure, a standardized form also would keep many of the fee types listed constant.",
                        "The Bureau proposed a sample form for the long form disclosure instead of a model form for the short form disclosure. The Bureau believed long form disclosures could vary depending on the number of fees included in the form and the extent of relevant conditions that would have had to be disclosed in connection with each fee."

The final rule requires that specific sections of the short form disclosure be in a tabular format. The Bureau continues to believe that this standardized format will increase consumer comprehension and enhance comparability among prepaid accounts, thereby creating a system under which consumers have the tools to make improved purchase and use decisions with regard to prepaid accounts.",
                        "The final rule, like the proposed rule, also requires that when a long form disclosure is provided in writing or electronically, the information required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(ii) shall be provided in the form of a table. Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) when the financial institution does not offer multiple service plans. The Bureau has removed the proposed requirement that the table in the long form be substantially similar to the table in the proposed sample form in favor of the statement that Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) above, the sample form for the long form disclosure, unlike the model forms for the short form disclosures, does not impose a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d requirement. Unlike the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that the comprehensive content of the long form, together with the wide variety of fees, fee types, and conditions under which those fees are imposed across financial institutions, is likely not suitable for a strictly standardized content and format design.",
                        "Because the long form disclosures, unlike the standardized short form disclosure, could vary substantially, the Bureau continues to believe that it is more appropriate to provide a sample form as an example that financial institutions may, but are not required to, incorporate or emulate in their own long form disclosures, rather than a model form that would only provide a safe harbor if financial institutions adhered closely to its parameters. Thus, in the regulatory text of the final rule, the Bureau has replaced any reference to long form content required to be disclosed in a form substantially similar to a sample form with language indicating that the sample form provides an example of the long form disclosure."

The Bureau proposed to relabel appendix A-5 as Model Clauses for Government Benefit Accounts (\u00a7\u20091005.15(e)(1) and (2)) and to revise the heading of paragraph (a) for clarity. The Bureau also proposed to revise the text of paragraph (a) of appendix A-5, which currently explains to consumers how to obtain information about account balances and account histories, to note that the consumer's balance information, along with an 18 month history of the consumer's account transactions, was available online. The Bureau also proposed to revise the paragraph regarding a written transaction summary to correspond with the proposed revised language for prepaid accounts in paragraph (a) of appendix A-7, to state that the consumer had a right to at least 18 months of written history of account transactions by calling or writing to the agency (or its designee). The paragraph would have also stated that the consumer would not be charged a fee for such information unless the consumer requested it more than once per month. The paragraph would have retained the existing optional bracketed language stating that the consumer could also request such a history by contacting his or her caseworker.",

The Bureau proposed to revise the section citation in the paragraph heading, and to revise the first paragraph of paragraph (b) to correspond with the proposed revised language for prepaid accounts in paragraph (b) of appendix A-7. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to remove the sentence stating that the agency must hear from the consumer no later than 60 days after the consumer learns of the error, and to add language stating that the agency must allow the consumer to report an error until 60 days after the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accessed his or her account, if the error could be viewed in the electronic history, or the date the agency sent the first written history on which the error appeared. The paragraph would have also stated that the consumer could request a written transaction history at any time by calling or writing, or optionally by contacting the consumer's caseworker.",

In addition, consumers will have the right to request at least 24 months of written transaction history, instead of the 18 months set forth in the proposed rule.

To reflect the proposed expansion of \u00a7\u20091005.18 to cover prepaid accounts, the Bureau proposed to revise the heading for existing appendix A-7 as well as the heading for paragraph (a) of appendix A-7. The Bureau also proposed to revise paragraph (a) of appendix A-7, which currently explains to consumers how to obtain account information for payroll card accounts, to change the term payroll card account to prepaid account, and to state that at least 18 months of electronic and written account transaction history is available to the consumer, rather than 60 days, as proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). The Bureau also proposed to add a sentence at the end of paragraph (a) of appendix A-7 to inform consumers that they could not be charged for requesting such written account transaction history, unless requests were made more than once per month.

To register an account, the consumer was directed to a Web site and telephone number. The model language would have explained that the financial institution would ask for identifying information about the consumer (including full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number or government-issued identification number), so that it could verify the consumer's identity. Once the financial institution had done so, it would address the consumer's complaint or question as described earlier in appendix A-7.",

First, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(c) above, the Bureau is revising the proposed time periods that apply to a consumer's right to obtain account information. Under the final rule, consumers will have the right to access up to 12 months of account history online, instead of the 18 months of account history in the proposed rule. In addition, consumers will have the right to request at least 24 months of written transaction history, instead of the 18 months set forth in the proposed rule.

To reflect this exception, the Bureau is adding bracketed language clarifying that the language in appendix A-7 informing consumers of their right to request 24 months of written account transaction history only applies to accounts that have been or can be registered with the financial institution.",
                "Third, the Bureau is making several revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3), which, as proposed, would have limited a financial institution's obligation to provide limited liability and error resolution for accounts with respect to which the financial institution had not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification. Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all prepaid accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no such process), the financial institution is not required to provisionally credit the consumer's account in the event the financial institution takes longer than 10 or 20 business days, as applicable, to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.",
                "To reflect these changes, the Bureau is revising paragraphs (b) and (c) of appendix A-7 as follows. The Bureau is revising the language in paragraph (b) describing a consumer's right to receive provisional credit in certain circumstances to reflect that, under the final rule, an account must be registered with the financial institution in order to be eligible for provisional credit. The Bureau is also revising paragraph (c), which under the final rule is only applicable to prepaid accounts that have a customer identification and verification process but for which the process is not completed before the account is opened (i.e., when the consumer must take an affirmative step to register the account after acquisition). Specifically, paragraph (c) is revised to reflect that, under the final rule, failure to register an account with the financial institution will not jeopardize a consumer's right to have an error investigated and resolved. Rather, as revised, final paragraph (c) explains that a consumer may not receive provisional credit while an error claim is pending on a prepaid account that has not been registered.",

If the transfer is sent from an account (e.g., a consumer transfers $100 out of the consumer's checking account) or to an account (e.g., a consumer sends $100 in cash to a family's member's bank account in a foreign country), the location of the account determines where the funds are being, as applicable, sent from or sent to.

In other words, the location of the consumer sending the funds determines where the funds are being sent from, and the location of the person receiving the funds determines where the funds are received. To illustrate, existing comment 30(c)-2.iii explains that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the remittance transfer provider has sufficient information to conclude that funds are to be received in a foreign country if the provider sends the prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country.",

Yet, the Bureau also noted that it did not intend to change how the Remittance Rule applied to prepaid products. Accordingly, the Bureau sought comments on whether additional clarification or guidance is necessary with respect to the Remittance Rule. Although the Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal, the Bureau believes that to facilitate compliance, it is necessary to clarify that for prepaid accounts other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, the location of these accounts does not determine where funds are being sent to or from. Accordingly, this final rule contains clarifying and conforming revisions to comments 30(c)-2.ii and 30(g)-1 to clarify that transfers involving a prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account) are not transfers from an account or to an account.
