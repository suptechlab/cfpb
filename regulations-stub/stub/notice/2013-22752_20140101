    "abstract": "This final rule amends some of the final mortgage rules issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) in January 2013. These amendments focus primarily on loss mitigation procedures under Regulation X's servicing provisions, amounts counted as loan originator compensation to retailers of manufactured homes and their employees for purposes of applying points and fees thresholds under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act and the Ability-to-Repay rules in Regulation Z, exemptions available to creditors that operate predominantly in ``rural or underserved'' areas for various purposes under the mortgage regulations, application of the loan originator compensation rules to bank tellers and similar staff, and the prohibition on creditor-financed credit insurance. The Bureau also is adjusting the effective dates for certain provisions of the loan originator compensation rules. In addition, the Bureau is adopting technical and wording changes for clarification purposes to Regulations B, X, and Z.",

Records are sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of compensation if they demonstrate the following facts: The nature and amount of the compensation; that the compensation was paid, and by whom; that the compensation was received, and by whom; and when the payment and receipt of compensation occurred. The compensation agreements themselves are to be retained in all circumstances consistent with \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2)(i). The additional records that are sufficient necessarily will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts and circumstances, particularly with regard to the nature of the compensation. For example, if the compensation is in the form of a salary, records to be retained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code that demonstrate the amount of the salary. If the compensation is in the form of a contribution to or a benefit under a designated tax-advantaged plan, records to be maintained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable Federal law relating to the plan, copies of the plan and amendments thereto in which individual loan originators participate and the names of any loan originators covered by the plan, or determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the plan. If the compensation is in the nature of a commission or bonus, records to be retained might include a settlement agent \u201cflow of funds\u201d worksheet or other written record or a creditor closing instructions letter directing disbursement of fees at consummation. Where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of compensation or broker agreement required by applicable State law that recites the broker's total compensation for a transaction is a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction, unless actual compensation deviates from the amount in the disclosure or agreement. Where compensation has been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting the decrease in compensation and reasons for it."

For purposes of \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2), a compensation agreement includes any agreement, whether oral, written, or based on a course of conduct that establishes a compensation arrangement between the parties (e.g., a brokerage agreement between a creditor and a mortgage broker or provisions of employment contracts between a creditor and an individual loan originator employee addressing payment of compensation). Where a compensation agreement is oral or based on a course of conduct and cannot itself be maintained, the records to be maintained are those, if any, evidencing the existence or terms of the oral or course of conduct compensation agreement. Creditors and loan originators are free to specify what transactions are governed by a particular compensation agreement as they see fit. For example, they may provide, by the terms of the agreement, that the agreement governs compensation payable on transactions consummated on or after some future effective date (in which case, a prior agreement governs transactions consummated in the meantime). For purposes of applying the record retention requirement to transaction-specific commissions, the relevant compensation agreement for a given transaction is the agreement pursuant to which compensation for that transaction is determined."

As used in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a \u201cnon-deferred profits-based compensation plan\u201d is any compensation arrangement where an individual loan originator may be paid variable, additional compensation based in whole or in part on the mortgage-related business profits of the person paying the compensation, any affiliate, or a business unit within the organizational structure of the person or the affiliate, as applicable (i.e., depending on the level within the person's or affiliate's organization at which the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan is established). A non-deferred profits-based compensation plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred compensation that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A, 26 U.S.C. 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or compensation under another form of deferred compensation plan are determined with reference to the mortgage-related business profits of the person making the contribution, then the contribution, benefits, or other compensation, as applicable, are not permitted by \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the individual loan originator may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred compensation, and the compensation under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the person (e.g., the person may elect not to pay compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan in a given year), provided the compensation is not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions. As used in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based compensation plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. Compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profits of the person, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable. As used in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational structure of the person or the person's affiliate that performs discrete business functions and that the person or the affiliate treats separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example, a creditor that pays its individual loan originators bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the creditor's average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to an individual loan originator from a source other than a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan (or a deferred compensation plan where the bonus is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits), such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of compensation based on the terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not apply to such bonuses."

The compensation restrictions under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) are sometimes referred to in this commentary as the \u201c10-percent total compensation limit\u201d or the \u201c10-percent limit.\u201d"

Under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1), determination of whether payment of compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan complies with the 10-percent limit requires a calculation of the ratio of the compensation under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan (i.e., the compensation subject to the 10-percent limit) and the total compensation corresponding to the relevant time period. For compensation subject to the 10-percent limit, the relevant time period is the time period for which a person makes reference to profits in determining the compensation (i.e., when the compensation was earned). It does not matter whether the compensation is actually paid during that particular time period. For total compensation, the relevant time period is the same time period, but only certain types of compensation may be included in the total compensation amount for that time period (see comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.A). For example, assume that during calendar year 2014 a creditor pays an individual loan originator compensation in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the individual loan originator's performance and volume of loans generated during the calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the individual loan originator. The creditor desires to pay the individual loan originator a year-end bonus of $10,000 under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan are made during calendar year 2014, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2015. For purposes of the 10-percent limit, the year-end bonus is counted toward the 10-percent limit for calendar year 2014, even though it is not actually paid until 2015. Therefore, for calendar year 2014 the individual loan originator's compensation that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total compensation would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, the designated tax-advantaged plan contribution (assuming the creditor elects to include it in total compensation for calendar year 2014), and the bonus (assuming the creditor elects to include it in total compensation for calendar year 2014)); the bonus would be permissible under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) because it does not exceed 10 percent of total compensation. The determination of total compensation corresponding to 2014 also would not take into account any compensation subject to the 10-percent limit that is actually paid in 2014 but is earned during a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits for calendar year 2013 that is paid in January 2014). If the employer contribution to the designated tax-advantaged plan is earned in 2014 but actually made in 2015, however, it may not be included in total compensation for 2014. A company, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable, may pay compensation subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a creditor uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the creditor pays an individual loan originator a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The creditor can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of the quarterly bonuses."

If any compensation paid to an individual loan originator under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) consists of an award of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prize or incentive, the cash value of the award is factored into the calculation of the 10-percent total compensation limit. For example, during a given calendar year, individual loan originator A and individual loan originator B are each employed by a creditor and paid $40,000 in salary, and $45,000 in commissions. The creditor also contributes $5,000 to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan for each individual loan originator during that calendar year, which the creditor elects to include in the total compensation amount. Neither individual loan originator is paid any other form of compensation by the creditor. In December of the calendar year, the creditor rewards both individual loan originators for their performance during the calendar year out of a bonus pool established with reference to the profits of the mortgage origination business unit. Individual loan originator A is paid a $10,000 cash bonus, meaning that individual loan originator A's total compensation is $100,000 (assuming the creditor elects to include the bonus in the total compensation amount). Individual loan originator B is paid a $7,500 cash bonus and awarded a vacation package with a cash value of $3,000, meaning that individual loan originator B's total compensation is $100,500 (assuming the creditor elects to include the reward in the total compensation amount). Under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1), individual loan originator A's $10,000 bonus is permissible because the bonus would not constitute more than 10 percent of individual loan originator A's total compensation for the calendar year. The creditor may not pay individual loan originator B the $7,500 bonus and award the vacation package, however, because the total value of the bonus and the vacation package would be $10,500, which is greater than 10 percent (10.45 percent) of individual loan originator B's total compensation for the calendar year. One way to comply with \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) would be if the amount of the bonus were reduced to $7,000 or less or the vacation package were structured such that its cash value would be $2,500 or less."

At the end of the year, the loan originator organization wishes to pay the individual loan originator a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is determined in part with reference to the profits of the company's mortgage origination unit. Assume that the loan originator organization derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by \u00a7 1026.36(d). In this example, the performance bonus would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple individual loan originators' transactions as described in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(i), because it is being determined with reference to profits from mortgage-related business. Assume, furthermore, that the loan originator organization elects to include the bonus in the total compensation amount for the calendar year. Thus, the bonus is permissible under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if it does not exceed 10 percent of the loan originator's total compensation, which in this example consists of the individual loan originator's salary and commissions, the contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the loan originator organization elects to include the contribution in the total compensation amount), and the performance bonus. Therefore, if the loan originator organization elects to include the 401(k) contribution in total compensation for these purposes, the loan originator organization may pay the individual loan originator a performance bonus of up to $20,000 (i.e., 10 percent of $200,000 in total compensation). If the loan originator organization does not include the 401(k) contribution in calculating total compensation, or the 401(k) contribution is actually made in January of the following calendar year (in which case it cannot be included in total compensation for the initial calendar year), the bonus may be up to $18,333.33. If the loan originator organization includes neither the 401(k) contribution nor the performance bonus in the total compensation amount, the bonus may not exceed $16,500."

At the end of the calendar year, the creditor pays the individual loan originator two bonuses: A \u201cperformance\u201d bonus based on the individual loan originator's aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profits of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end \u201choliday\u201d bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool.

Assuming that the conditions in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(A) are met, \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) permits compensation to an individual loan originator under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan even if the payment or contribution is directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple individual loan originators' transactions if the individual is a loan originator (as defined in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)) for ten or fewer consummated transactions during the 12-month period preceding the compensation determination. For example, assume a loan originator organization employs two individual loan originators who originate transactions subject to \u00a7 1026.36 during a given calendar year. Both employees are individual loan originators as defined in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(ii), but only one of them (individual loan originator B) acts as a loan originator in the normal course of business, while the other (individual loan originator A) is called upon to do so only occasionally and regularly performs other duties (such as serving as a manager). In January of the following calendar year, the loan originator organization formally determines the financial performance of its mortgage business for the prior calendar year. Based on that determination, the loan originator organization on February 1 decides to pay a bonus to the individual loan originators out of a company bonus pool. Assume that, between February 1 of the prior calendar year and January 31 of the current calendar year, individual loan originator A was the loan originator for eight consummated transactions, and individual loan originator B was the loan originator for 15 consummated transactions. The loan originator organization may award the bonus to individual loan originator A under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2). The loan originator organization may not award the bonus to individual loan originator B relying on the exception under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) because it would not apply, although it could award a bonus pursuant to the 10-percent total compensation limit under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if the requirements of that provision are complied with."

Section 1026.36 does not limit a creditor or other person from periodically revising the compensation it agrees to pay a loan originator. However, the revised compensation arrangement must not result in payments to the loan originator that are based on the terms of a credit transaction. A creditor or other person might periodically review factors such as loan performance, transaction volume, as well as current market conditions for loan originator compensation, and prospectively revise the compensation it agrees to pay to a loan originator. For example, assume that during the first six months of the year, a creditor pays $3,000 to a particular loan originator for each loan delivered, regardless of the terms of the transaction. After considering the volume of business produced by that loan originator, the creditor could decide that as of July 1, it will pay $3,250 for each loan delivered by that particular loan originator, regardless of the terms of the transaction. No violation occurs even if the loans made by the creditor after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, to reflect the higher compensation."

                                "In addition to the HOEPA and ATR balloon provisions discussed above, the definitions of \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d also relate to the \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) exemption from the requirement that creditors establish escrow accounts for certain higher-priced mortgage loans available to small creditors that operate predominantly in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas. The exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) was designed to promote access to credit by exempting small creditors in rural or underserved areas that might have sufficient difficulty maintaining escrow accounts that they would curtail making higher-priced mortgage loans rather than trigger the escrow account requirement. As adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, and as amended by the May 2013 Escrows Final Rule,\n            the exemption is available to creditors that extended more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions secured by a first lien on properties that are located in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d counties during the preceding calendar year. In general, a county's status as \u201crural\u201d is defined in relation to Urban Influence Codes (UICs) established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.", 
                                "Because of updated information from the 2010 Census, however, numerous counties' status under the Bureau's definition will change between 2013 and 2014, with a small number of new counties meeting the definition of \u201crural\u201d and approximately 82 counties no longer meeting that definition. The Bureau estimates that approximately 200-300 otherwise eligible creditors during 2013 could lose their eligibility for 2014 solely because of changes in the status of the counties in which they operate (assuming the geographical distribution of their mortgage originations does not change significantly over the relevant period).\n            \n          ",

The proposal would have revised \u00a7 1026.35(b) and its commentary to minimize volatility in the definitions while they are being re-evaluated.

The same housing counseling organization that disagreed with the balloon exception adopted by the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule also disagreed with the original exemption from the escrows requirement and thus also the proposed expansion. As before, this commenter did not raise any specific issues related to the proposal, but rather stated that all higher-priced mortgage loans should be escrowed, without exception.

                                "The Bureau is adopting revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) as proposed. The amended provision provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must have extended more than 50 percent of its total covered transactions secured by a first lien on properties located in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d counties during any of the preceding three calendar years. The provision thus prevents a creditor from losing eligibility for the exemption under the \u201crural or underserved\u201d element of the test unless it has failed to exceed the 50-percent threshold three years in a row.", 
                                "As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C), the Bureau also is modifying the exception from the prohibition on balloon payments for high-cost mortgages in that section. Section 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) provides an exception to the general prohibition on balloon payments for high-cost mortgages for balloon-payment qualified mortgages made by certain creditors operating predominantly in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas. Believing that the same rationale for allowing balloon-payment qualified mortgages made by creditors in rural or underserved areas applies to high-cost mortgages, the Bureau adopted the \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) exception in the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule. As explained above, the Bureau believes the same underlying rationale for the two-year transition period for balloon-payment qualified mortgages described above applies equally to the \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) exception from the high-cost mortgage balloon prohibition. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to extend this temporary framework to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) and therefore is amending \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) to include loans meeting the criteria under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6). Thus, for both balloon-payment qualified mortgages and for the high-cost mortgage balloon prohibition, the Bureau has adopted a two-year transition period during which the special treatment of balloon-payment loans does not depend on the creditor operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas.", 
                                "The Bureau considered taking the same approach with regard to the escrow requirement but concluded ultimately that a smaller adjustment was appropriate. Because higher-priced mortgage loans are already subject to an escrow requirement, all creditors are currently required to maintain escrow accounts for such loans. Implementation of the amendments to the exemption will thus reduce burden for some creditors, but does not impose different requirements than the status quo except as to the length of time that an escrow account must be maintained. This is fundamentally different than the ability-to-repay and high-cost mortgage requirements, which would prohibit new balloon-payment loans from being accorded qualified mortgage status or from being made going forward absent implementation of the special exemptions. In addition, the Bureau may change the definitions of rural or underserved areas as the result of its re-examination process but does not anticipate lifting the requirement that creditors operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas to qualify for the exemption because Congress specifically contemplated that limitation on the escrows exemption. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to leave the definition in place, but to prevent volatility in the definition from negatively affecting creditors while the Bureau re-evaluates the underlying definitions. The Bureau believes that, as with the two balloon-payment provisions for which the Bureau believes two-year transition periods are appropriate, this amendment will benefit consumers by expanding access to credit in certain areas that met the definitions of \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d at some time in the preceding three calendar years and also will facilitate compliance for creditors that make these loans. The Bureau also believes that the amendment will promote additional consistency between the regulatory provisions adopted by the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, the 2013 ATR Final Rule, and the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, thereby facilitating compliance for affected creditors.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that the mechanics of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) differ slightly from the express transition period ending on January 10, 2016, under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6). Thus, this amendment does not parallel the same transition period precisely, as does revised \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C), which simply incorporates \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6)'s conditions by cross-reference. Instead, revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) approximates a two-year transition period by extending from one to three years the time for which a creditor, once eligible for the exemption, cannot lose that eligibility because of changes in the rural (or underserved) status of the counties in which the creditor operates. Because the 2013 Escrows Final Rule took effect on June 1, 2013, the escrows provisions already have begun operating over seven months earlier than the provisions adopted by the 2013 HOEPA and ATR Final Rules (which take effect on January 10, 2014). Thus, whereas the two balloon-payment provisions specifically last through January 10, 2016, the escrows-requirement exemption will guarantee eligibility (for a creditor that is eligible during 2013 with respect to operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas, and meets the other applicable criteria) through 2015. Thus, the revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) exemption will approximately, though not exactly, track the extension of the balloon exemption for qualified mortgages under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6), and the extension of the HOEPA balloon exemption under revised \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C).", 
                                "In addition to the changes discussed above, the Bureau also is amending \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and its commentary to conform to the expansion of the exemption to creditors that may meet the section 35(b)(2)(iii)(A) criteria for calendar year 2014 based on loans made in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties in calendar year 2011, but not 2012 or 2013. Section &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) currently prohibits any creditor from availing itself of the exemption if it maintains escrow accounts for any extensions of consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling that it or its affiliate currently service, unless the escrow accounts were established for first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2013, or were established after consummation as an accommodation for distressed consumers. With respect to loans where escrows were established on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2013, the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule explained that the Bureau believes creditors should not be penalized for compliance with the then current regulation, which would have required any such loans to be escrowed after April 1, 2010, and prior to June 1, 2013&#8212;the date the exemption took effect. The Bureau understands that creditors that did not make more than 50 percent of their first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties in calendar year 2012 would have been ineligible for the exemption for calendar year 2013, and thus would have been required under &#167; 1026.35(a) to establish escrow accounts for any higher-priced mortgage loans those creditors made after June 1, 2013. However, it is possible in light of the amendments the Bureau is adopting that some of these same creditors may have met this criteria during calendar year 2011&#8212;and thus, because the Bureau is finalizing the proposal and allowing creditors to qualify for the exemption (assuming they satisfy the other conditions set forth in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), (C), and (D))&#8212;such creditors will qualify for the exemption in 2014. However, absent additional clarification, there would be one barrier: For applications received on or after June 1, 2013, but before the date the proposed amendment takes effect (as proposed, January 1, 2014), such a creditor that made a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan would have been required to escrow for that loan, and thus would be deemed ineligible under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). The Bureau does not believe that such creditors should lose the exemption because they were ineligible prior to the proposed amendment taking effect and thus made loans with escrows from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. As the Bureau discussed in the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau believes creditors should not be penalized for compliance with the current regulation. The Bureau thus believes it is appropriate to amend &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1.iv to exclude escrow accounts established after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2014.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau is revising comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1.iv to clarify that the date ranges provided in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) apply to transactions for which creditors received applications on or after April 1, 2010, and before January 1, 2014. As discussed above, the Bureau believes such creditors should still qualify for the exemption provided under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) so long as they do not establish new escrow accounts for transactions for which they received applications on or after January 1, 2014, other than those described in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>), and they otherwise qualify under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). The Bureau believes this clarification reflects both the manner in which the 2013 Escrows Rule originally applied to transactions and the applicability of this final rule.\n          "

                                "The Bureau proposed to amend \u00a7 1026.36(a) and its commentary to clarify the meaning of \u201ccredit terms,\u201d which is used in defining some of the exclusions to the general definition of \u201cloan originator,\u201d thereby further delineating the general definition. For example, as adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) allows persons who act as assistants to loan originators to perform clerical or administrative tasks on a loan originator's behalf without becoming loan originators themselves. To be eligible for the exclusion, however, the person must not, among other things, offer or negotiate \u201ccredit terms available from a creditor.\u201d", 
                                "Similarly, comment 36(a)-4.i. explains when providing a consumer with a credit application, an activity that would otherwise be a referral, does not cause a person to be classified as a loan originator. This comment provides an exception to certain persons who, among other things, do not discuss \u201cspecific credit terms or products available from a creditor with the consumer.\u201d", 
                                "In addition, comment 36(a)-4.ii.B explains when a loan originator's or creditor's employee, such as a teller or greeter, may engage in providing loan originator contact information to consumers, an activity that would otherwise be a referral, without being classified as a loan originator. This comment provides that the definition of loan originator does not include a creditor's or loan originator's employee who provides loan originator or creditor contact information to a consumer, provided the employee does not, among other things, \u201cdiscuss particular credit terms available from a creditor.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) and comments 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em> through-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">4</em> (other similar references to credit terms). This exclusion also assists in defining persons who are loan originators in the sense that it implies persons who do discuss specific or particular credit terms, as this activity is further clarified in this rule, would be included in the definition.", 
                                "Following publication of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from loan originators and creditors seeking guidance on the meaning of \u201ccredit terms\u201d in these various contexts. In light of these inquiries, the Bureau was concerned that the term \u201ccredit terms\u201d could have been construed too broadly and in a manner that could render any person that provides such general information a loan originator, which was not the Bureau's intent. Rather, the Bureau generally intended the references to \u201ccredit terms\u201d throughout \u00a7 1026.36(a) to refer to particular credit terms that are or may be made available <em data-original=\"E-03\">to the consumer</em> selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics. Distinct from such particular credit terms are general credit terms that a loan originator or creditor makes available and advertises to the public at large, such as where such person merely states: &#8220;We offer rates as low as 3% to qualified consumers.&#8221;", 
                                "To address these questions, the Bureau proposed to clarify usage of the term \u201ccredit terms\u201d throughout the section in several ways. First, the Bureau noted that the definition of \u201ccredit terms,\u201d which explains the term includes rate, fees, and other costs, had been provided only by a parenthetical clause in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) (a single exclusion that relates to retailers of manufactured homes) rather than in a separate, definitional provision. Thus, the definition appears to be limited to that single provision, even though the term is used in multiple places throughout \u00a7 1026.36(a). For clarification purposes, the Bureau proposed to move this definition from \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), to new \u00a7 1026.36(a)(6), which explicitly makes the definition applicable to the entire section. The Bureau solicited comment on whether additional guidance concerning the meaning of particular credit terms that are or may be made available to the consumer in light of the consumer's financial characteristics is necessary, and if so, what clarifications would be helpful.", 
                                "Second, the Bureau proposed to revise \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and (B), and comments 36(a)-1 and -4 to address inconsistencies regarding the meaning of \u201ccredit terms,\u201d and to clarify that an activity involving credit terms for purposes of determining when a person is a loan originator must relate to \u201cparticular credit terms that are or may be available from a creditor to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics,\u201d not credit terms generally. The proposal would have clarified that a person who discusses with a consumer that, based on the consumer's financial characteristics, a creditor should be able to offer the consumer an interest rate of 3%, would be considered a loan originator. However, a person who merely states general information such as \u201cwe offer rates as low as 3% to qualified consumers\u201d would not have been considered a loan originator because the person is not offering particular credit terms that are or may be available to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics."

Some commenters requested additional clarification regarding the meaning and application of \u201cthe consumer's financial characteristics.\u201d A few industry commenters suggested that \u201cfinancial characteristics\u201d be limited to traditional factors that influence a credit decision, such as income and credit score. These commenters also asked the Bureau to clarify that an assessment of a consumer's financial characteristics does not include a person simply having general knowledge of the consumer's account or finances, but requires an actual assessment of the consumer's financial characteristics that form the basis for selection of credit terms. Consumer groups generally supported the clarification, but suggested that an assessment of a consumer's financial characteristics should include steering based on other factors such as race, ethnicity, or zip code."

In response to public comments requesting additional clarification, the Bureau is modifying proposed \u00a7 1026.36(a)(6) to clarify that credit terms are selected based on a consumer's financial characteristics when those terms are selected based on factors that may influence a credit decision, such as the consumer's debts, income, assets, or credit history. The Bureau intends this language to capture situations where credit terms are offered or discussed as available or potentially available to a consumer based on that consumer's ability to obtain such credit. This would include examining the consumer's credit history (which could include a credit score), income, debts, or assets and then selecting credit terms that are either available or potentially available to the consumer based on those factors. The Bureau does not intend this language to cover situations where, for example, an employee of a loan originator or creditor may be aware of a consumer's assets, income, or other factors but does not select credit terms based on those factors.",

To the extent that inappropriate non-financial characteristics such as race, gender, or ethnicity may factor into the selection of credit terms, the Bureau believes such situations would be addressed by other applicable laws such as ECOA and the Fair Housing Act. In any event, the Bureau did not intend this clarification to define the appropriate means of evaluating consumers for credit; rather it only intended to clarify when a person may be considered a loan originator by virtue of discussing credit terms with a consumer.

While generally any person, including a loan originator employee would be acting as a loan originator for purposes of \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1) if he or she refers consumers to a particular creditor by providing an application from that creditor, the Bureau does not believe that a loan originator or creditor employee should be considered a loan originator for simply providing an application from the loan originator or creditor entity for which he or she works. The Bureau believes that, in such a case, provided that the person does not assist the consumer in completing the application or otherwise influence his or her decision, the person is performing an administrative task on behalf of the entity for which he or she works. Thus, in the Bureau's view, there would be little appreciable benefit for consumers for the rule to regard such persons as loan originators.",

Moreover, the Bureau notes that classifying such individuals as loan originators for providing an application without first waiting for an express request from the consumer would subject them to the requirements applicable to loan originators. Again, in the Bureau's view, there would be little appreciable benefit for consumers for the rule to regard such persons as loan originators where the person is simply providing a credit application from the entity for whom the person works. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 36(a)-4.i as proposed, including removing the condition that the provision of the application must be \u201cat the request of the consumer\u201d and making a conforming change to the comment to only apply to employees of the loan originator or creditor, not all persons. However, the Bureau is making some wording changes for purposes of consistency with comment 36(a)-4.ii.B. The Bureau also is removing a reference to \u201ccredit products\u201d which also is inconsistent with comment 36(a)-4.ii.B. The Bureau believes in both instances the rule should consider employees to be loan originators when such persons discuss credit terms that are or may be made available by a creditor or loan originator to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics, not when they simply discuss particular categories of credit products generally, such as mortgages or home equity loans. Also as discussed above, the Bureau is not adopting proposed language that expressly would have extended this comment to agents or contractors of loan originators or creditors."

                                "Comment 36(a)-4.ii.B provides that the definition of loan originator does not include persons who, as employees of a creditor or loan originator, provide loan originator or creditor contact information to a consumer in response to the consumer's request, provided that the employee does not discuss particular credit terms available from a creditor and does not direct the consumer, based on the employee's assessment of the consumer's financial characteristics, to a particular loan originator or creditor seeking to originate particular credit transactions to consumers with those financial characteristics. Prior to issuing the proposal, the Bureau received many inquiries on this topic from stakeholders expressing concern that, absent a clarifying amendment, the rule could be interpreted to require tellers, greeters, or other such employees to be classified as loan originators for merely providing contact information to a consumer who did not clearly or explicitly ask for it. Stakeholders further asserted that such persons should not be considered loan originators when their conduct is limited to following a script prompting them to ask whether the consumer is interested in a mortgage loan and the tellers are not able to engage in any independent assessment of the consumer. Moreover, stakeholders have asserted it would be very costly to implement the training and certification requirements under Regulation Z as amended by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule for employers with large numbers of administrative staff who interact with consumers on a day-to-day basis in the manner described.",

                                "The Bureau is adopting comment 36(a)-4.ii.B as proposed with two modifications. First, as discussed above with respect to comment 36(a)-4.i, the Bureau is not adopting proposed language that would have extended the scope of the comment to agents or contractors of loan originators or creditors. Second, the Bureau is clarifying that the exclusion is only available to employees of a loan originator or creditor that provide the contact information of the loan originator or creditor entity for which he or she works, or of a person who works for that same entity. As proposed, the Bureau is removing the qualifying phrase \u201cin response to the consumer's request.\u201d The Bureau believes ambiguity regarding the meaning of \u201cin response to a consumer's request\u201d could have caused unnecessary compliance challenges. In such instances, the Bureau does not believe tellers or other such staff should be considered loan originators for merely providing loan originator or creditor contact information to the consumer (which would consist of such an employee directing a consumer to a loan originator who works for the same entity, or a creditor that is the same entity, as made explicit to conform the language in comments 4.i and 4.ii.B). The Bureau also notes that classifying such individuals as loan originators would subject them to the requirements applicable to loan originators with, in the Bureau's view, little appreciable benefit for consumers. However, the Bureau is retaining language, with some conforming changes, that would cover within the definition of \u201cloan originator\u201d any such employee of a creditor or loan originator organization who, in the course of providing loan originator or creditor contact information to the consumer, directs that consumer to a particular loan originator or particular creditor based on his or her assessment of the consumer's financial characteristics or discusses particular credit terms that are or may be available from a creditor or loan originator to the consumer selected based on consumer's financial characteristics. The Bureau believes these actions can influence the credit terms that the consumer ultimately obtains, and continues to believe these actions should result in application of the requirements imposed by the rule on loan originators. The Bureau believes this amendment should enable creditors and loan originators to implement the rule with respect to persons acting under the controlled circumstances specified by the comment while maintaining stronger protections in situations where significant steering could occur.", 
                                "As noted above, the Bureau is making one adjustment to the comment to clarify that the exclusion only is available to an employee of a loan originator or creditor who provides the contact information of the loan originator or creditor entity for which he or she works, or of a person who works for that same entity. The Bureau recognizes that the proposed amendments did not expressly limit the exclusion in this way. However, the Bureau intended that the exclusion be subject to this limitation and believes it was strongly implied, given that the language of the exclusion begins with the qualification that the definition of loan originator does not include persons who,\u201d as employees of a creditor or loan originator,\u201d engage in certain activities. The fact that the exclusion only applies to persons in their capacity as employees of creditors or loan originators signals that they are only providing loan originator or creditor contract information for the entity for which they work. The Bureau did not contemplate that such persons would provide contact information, as employees of a creditor or loan originator, to loan originators or creditors that were not their employers and no comments indicating a different understanding of this provision were received. However, to better clarify application of the provision, the Bureau is modifying comment 36(a)-4.ii.B to state that the exclusion only extends to employees providing the contact information of \u201cthe entity for which he or she works or of a person who works for that same entity.\u201d The Bureau believes this will eliminate any ambiguity in the proposed comment that may have led such employees to believe the exclusion would extend to providing contact information for loan originators or creditors outside the entity for which they work. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting this revised comment as proposed with this modification.", 
                                "Finally, as discussed in greater detail below in the section that addresses employees of manufactured housing retailers, the Bureau also received some comments that suggested manufactured housing retailer employees should be exempt from the loan originator definition altogether for \u201creferring,\u201d or otherwise should fall under this particular exclusion, regardless of whether they are employees, agents, or contractors of a loan originator or creditor. As discussed below in the discussion of \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), the Bureau does not believe that any additional amendments to this comment are necessary that relate to manufactured housing retailer employees."

As a result of these proposed revisions, employees (or agents or contractors) of manufactured home retailers who provide a credit application form from one particular creditor or loan originator organization that is not the entity for which they work would not have qualified for the exclusions in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) or \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) and comment 36(a)-4.i. would not apply.

These commenters suggested that retailer employees should be allowed to \u201crefer\u201d customers to particular loan originators or creditors other than the retailer itself without being considered loan originators, so long as the other conditions set forth in comment 36(a)-4.i are met.

One such exclusion exists for manufactured home retailer employees in TILA section 103(cc)(2)(C)(ii), and provides that the second part of the three-part test described above\u2014assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain a mortgage loan\u2014does not render a retailer employee a loan originator provided the employee does not engage in either of the other two steps (taking an application or offering or negotiating terms) and also does not advise a consumer on loan terms (including rates, fees, and other costs). Thus, a retailer employee who merely assists without offering, negotiating, taking an application, or advising, is not a loan originator (while one who offers or negotiates, takes an application, or advises on loan terms would be a loan originator).", 
                                "This statutory provision was implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which is based on, and largely tracks, the statutory language. Consistent with this statutory structure, \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) provides an exclusion for \u201cAn employee of a manufactured home retailer who does not take a consumer credit application, offer or negotiate credit terms available from a creditor, or advise a consumer on credit terms (including rates, fees, and other costs) available from a creditor.\u201d The effect of this exclusion is that retailer employees are loan originators if they do anything in the general, core definition in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i) other than \u201cassist\u201d in a manner that doesn't constitute taking, advising, offering or negotiating, or advising on credit terms. Because both \u201cassisting\u201d and \u201coffering\u201d include the activity of referring, a retailer employee who makes a referral is \u201coffering\u201d and therefore is a loan originator.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau believes these provisions make clear how employees of manufactured housing retailers fit within the \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i) definition of loan originator, including with respect to referrals as described in comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1.</em> The Bureau also provided some additional explanation in the Supplementary Information to the proposed rule, which sought to clarify further the application of comment 36(a)-4.i to such employees. However, the Bureau continues to receive inquiries from industry, including comments received in connection with the June 2013 Proposal, that indicate there is still substantial confusion regarding the application of these provisions and comments to employees of manufactured housing retailers. For this reason, the Bureau is adopting additional commentary to provide further guidance and codify explanations previously set forth in the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule and the June 2013 Proposal.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Proposed amendments to &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B).</em> The Bureau is not adopting in this final rule proposed amendments to &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) other than moving the definition of &#8220;credit terms&#8221; to &#167; 1026.36(a)(6). As discussed above related to &#8220;credit terms,&#8221; the Bureau proposed to modify the reference to &#8220;credit terms&#8221; in &#167;&#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), as well as comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B, to be limited to &#8220;credit terms available from a creditor to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics.&#8221; As discussed above, the Bureau believes this limitation is appropriate in the context of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B. Each of these provisions addresses situations where employees of a loan originator or creditor may, absent exception, be considered loan originators for conducting activity within the entities for which they work. For example, &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) relates to persons who perform purely administrative or clerical tasks on behalf of a person who is classified as a loan originator or creditor, while comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B relate to determining whether an employee of a loan originator or creditor engages in &#8220;referring&#8221; by providing an application from the entity for which such person works, or providing loan originator or creditor contact information for a loan originator or creditor that is or works for the same entity. Each of these situations applies to persons who may be assisting loan originators within the same entity or otherwise technically &#8220;referring&#8221; consumers to loan originators or creditors that are or work for the same entity. However, upon further consideration the Bureau believes the limitation is not appropriate in the context of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which states that a manufactured home retailer employee would not be considered a loan originator if that person does not, among other things, &#8220;offer or negotiate credit terms&#8221; or &#8220;advise a consumer on credit terms.&#8221; The limitation is only intended to apply in the context of an employee of a loan originator or creditor assisting a loan originator or making a referral to the loan originator or creditor entity for which such person works. To the extent a retailer of manufactured housing is also a loan originator or creditor, the exclusions under &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B may be available for its employees. However, the limitation has no applicability outside of the loan originator or creditor employer/employee context and, accordingly, is not being included as the Bureau proposed in &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which addresses a different employer/employee context.", 
                                "Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting this proposed change to \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B).", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Referrals.</em> The Bureau is amending comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> to explain further the underlying statutory and regulatory bases for including &#8220;referrals&#8221; as loan originator activity. As adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> explains what actions constitute &#8221; referring&#8221; for purposes of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i), while comment 36(a)-4 and its subparts provide guidance on certain activities that do not constitute referring. The Bureau is amending this comment to explain that referring is an activity included under each of the activities of offering, arranging, or assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain an extension of credit. Accordingly, the Bureau believes this amendment makes clear that, while a referral may be considered &#8220;assisting,&#8221; it also falls within other statutory and regulatory categories of loan originator activity not excluded from the loan originator definition for manufactured housing retailer employees. The Bureau believes the discussion above and the conforming revision to comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> better clarify what activities, when done by an employee of a retailer of manufactured homes, will cause such an employee to be classified as a loan originator for purposes of &#167; 1026.36. The Bureau further notes this revision is consistent with the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which provides an extensive discussion of the activities covered by TILA section 103(cc)(2)(A)(ii).\n            As noted above in this preamble, the retailer employee exclusion allows such an employee to engage in &#8220;assisting&#8221; activities in a manner that doesn't constitute taking, advising, offering or negotiating, or advising on credit terms.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">New commentary.</em> In addition, the Bureau is adding new commentary to provide further guidance on what activities may be considered &#8220;assisting,&#8221; but not other loan originator activities such as offering, arranging, or taking an application. In the Bureau's view, these activities, when engaged in by employees of manufactured housing retailers (in the absence of other activities), do not render such employees loan originators for purposes of &#167; 1026.36. Accordingly, to provide greater clarity concerning the retailer employee exclusion consistent with these conclusions, a new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B) is added by this final rule. The comment states that engaging in certain listed activities, as described below, does not make such an employee a loan originator.", 
                                "The Bureau is adding new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-1.i to explain that a retailer employee may generally describe the credit application process to a consumer and that this activity, standing alone, would not cause the employee to be considered a loan originator.\n            However, the retailer employee would be considered a loan originator if he or she advises on credit terms available from a creditor.", 
                                "The Bureau is adding new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-1.ii to explain that a retailer employee may prepare residential mortgage loan packages without being considered a loan originator.\n            Thus, a retailer employee may compile and process application materials and supporting documentation and, further consistent with the Final Rule, provide general application instruction to consumers so consumers can complete an application, but without interacting or communicating with the consumer regarding specific transaction terms.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that this comment is consistent with the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which states:", 
                                "The Bureau agrees that persons generally engaged in loan processing orwho compile and process application materials and supportingdocumentation and do not take an application, collect information onbehalf of the consumer, or communicate or interact with consumers regardingspecific transaction terms or products are not loan originators (see the separatediscussion above on taking an application and collecting informationon behalf of the consumer).\n              \n            ",

                                "The Bureau believes that most consumers purchasing a manufactured home will need financing, and that a limited set of options may be available. As public commenters have noted, only a small number of creditors make loans secured by manufactured homes, and it is beneficial to consumers for that information to be made available to them by a retailer. To facilitate consumer access to credit in this situation, new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-.1.iv allows a retailer employee to make general information about creditors or loan originators available, which includes making available, in a neutral manner, general brochures or information about the different creditors or loan originators that may offer financing to a consumer, but does not include recommending a particular creditor or loan originator or otherwise influencing the consumer's decision. The Bureau believes this comment falls within the purview of the quoted portion of comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> above, taking into consideration the unique circumstances and the limited statutory exclusion.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau notes that the comment extends to providing general information about loan originators (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> mortgage brokers) as well as creditors. Based on public comments, the Bureau believes that under current market conditions only a small number of specialized creditors currently operate in this market, and the Bureau is not aware of any mortgage brokers or similar loan originators that currently operate in this space. Nevertheless, the Bureau recognizes that circumstances may change and brokers or other loan originators may decide to offer loans secured by manufactured homes, and if that were to occur the Bureau believes the same logic that applies to creditors described above would apply with respect to these persons or organizations. Accordingly, the comment includes loan originators as well as creditors."

                        "Section 1026.36(a) defines the term \u201cloan originator\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1026.36 as a person\n            who, for or in expectation of direct or indirect compensation or other monetary gain, engages in a defined set of activities or services (unless otherwise excluded). Section 1026.36(a) describes these activities broadly to include any such person who \u201ctakes an application, offers, arranges, assists a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain, negotiates, or otherwise obtains or makes an extension of consumer credit for another person; or through advertising or other means of communication represents to the public that such person can or will perform any of these activities.\u201d Commentary to \u00a7 1026.36(a) further describes and provides illustrations of these activities, including how the practice of \u201creferring\u201d consumers to creditors or loan originators, may affect one's status under the section.", 
                        "Following publication of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from industry regarding the activities that, if done for compensation or gain, would cause a person to be classified as a \u201cloan originator\u201d under \u00a7 1026.36. As discussed below, many of these inquiries sought clarification regarding specific terms used throughout the section, such as \u201ccredit terms,\u201d or guidance on how the provision may apply to certain loan originator or creditor employees, agents or contractors such as tellers and greeters, as well as other interpretive questions. In response, the Bureau proposed several amendments to \u00a7 1026.36(a) and associated commentary adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule to resolve inconsistencies in wording, to conform the comments to the intended operation of the regulation text, and to address issues raised during the regulatory implementation process. The Bureau proposed these changes pursuant to its TILA section 105(a) and Dodd-Frank Act section 1022(b)(1) authority. As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting most of these amendments as proposed with some revisions and additional clarifying amendments.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed to revise comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B to clarify those provisions' application to loan originator or creditor agents and contractors as well as employees. The Bureau is not adopting this aspect of the proposal. As discussed below, comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B illustrate two situations where an employee of a creditor or loan originator is conducting \u201cin house\u201d activity for his or her employer that is not considered to be \u201creferring\u201d: (1) Handing applications from the employer to a consumer; and (2) providing loan originator or creditor contact information for the loan originator or creditor entity for which the person works, or a person that works for the same entity. The Bureau proposed to clarify that comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B may be available to certain persons who work for creditors or loan originators, but may not technically be \u201cemployed\u201d by the loan originator or creditor organization\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> contract employees, temporary employees, interns, or other persons who may be working on a voluntary basis or being paid by another entity. However, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes the terms &#8220;agent&#8221; and &#8220;contractor&#8221; could be interpreted more broadly than the Bureau intended to include independent contractors or agents used by loan originators or creditors to refer customers to that loan originator or creditor. The Bureau did not intend these provisions to be applied this broadly, and also is concerned that such a reading could be inconsistent with other applicable laws, such as RESPA's prohibition on referral fees for federally related mortgages. Accordingly, the Bureau is limiting the scope of this comment to employees of loan originators or creditors.", 
                        "The Bureau notes, however, that this does not mean these provisions may never be available to certain persons who may possibly be considered agents or contractors, such as temps or contract employees. While these provisions are limited to employees of creditors or loan originators, \u00a7 1026.2(b)(3) states that any terms not defined by Regulation Z is given the meanings given to them by State law or contract. The Bureau believes the term \u201cemployee\u201d\u2014which is not defined under Regulation Z\u2014is commonly defined under State law as well as employment contracts, and may extend to such persons in appropriate circumstances."

                        "The Bureau proposed revisions to the portions of comment 36(d)(1)-3 that interpret \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). Section 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) permits, under certain circumstances, the payment of compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan to an individual loan originator even if the compensation is directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators. Section 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) permits this compensation if it does not exceed 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation corresponding to the time period for which the compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan is paid. Comments 36(d)(1)-3.ii through -3.v further interpret &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>). Section 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) permits this compensation if the individual loan originator is a loan originator for ten or fewer consummated transactions during the 12-month period preceding the compensation determination. Comment 36(d)(1)-3.vi further interprets &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>). The Bureau proposed to amend comment 36(d)(1)-3 to improve the consistency of the wording across the regulatory text and commentary, provide further interpretation as to the intended meaning of the regulatory text in &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), and ensure that the examples included in the commentary accurately reflect the interpretations of the regulatory text contained elsewhere in the commentary. As the Bureau explained in the proposal, nearly all of the proposed revisions address the commentary sections that interpret the meaning of &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> setting forth the 10-percent total compensation limit) and not &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>). In the proposal, the Bureau explained that it was proposing more extensive clarifications to two comments interpreting &#167; 1026.36(d)(1), comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.A, which clarifies the meaning of &#8220;total compensation&#8221; as used in &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), and comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.C, to clarify the meaning of &#8220;time period&#8221; in &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>). The Bureau stated in the proposal that these proposed revisions were collectively intended to clarify that, while the time period used to determine both elements of the 10-percent limit ratio is the same: (1) the non-deferred profits-based compensation for the time period is whatever such compensation was earned during that time period, regardless of when it was actually paid; and (2) compensation that is actually paid during the time period, regardless of when it was earned, generally will be included in the amount of total compensation for that time period, but whether the compensation is included ultimately depends on the type of compensation.", 
                        "Of the institutions and individuals who submitted comments on the proposed changes to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, very few specifically discussed the proposed clarifications and amendments to \u00a7 1026.36(d) and its commentary. One large depository institution first highlighted some of the proposed changes to the \u00a7 1026.36(d) commentary and then stated that it generally agreed with the Bureau's proposed amendments and clarifications. Some consumer groups expressed general disagreement with elements of \u00a7 1026.36(d) adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which they believe the proposed revisions would amplify, but did not address any specific issues with the proposal itself.",
