    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is amending Regulation Z to implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The final rule implements requirements and restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act concerning loan originator compensation; qualifications of, and registration or licensing of loan originators; compliance procedures for depository institutions; mandatory arbitration; and the financing of single- premium credit insurance. The final rule revises or provides additional commentary on Regulation Z's restrictions on loan originator compensation, including application of these restrictions to prohibitions on dual compensation and compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction, and to recordkeeping requirements. The final rule also establishes tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits-based compensation arrangements. At this time, the Bureau is not prohibiting payments to and receipt of payments by loan originators when a consumer pays upfront points or fees in the mortgage transaction. Instead the Bureau will first study how points and fees function in the market and the impact of this and other mortgage-related rulemakings on consumers' understanding of and choices with respect to points and fees. This final rule is designed primarily to protect consumers by reducing incentives for loan originators to steer consumers into loans with particular terms and by ensuring that loan originators are adequately qualified.",

The main MHA components are the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a Treasury program that uses TARP funds to provide incentives for mortgage servicers to modify eligible first-lien mortgages, and two initiatives at the GSEs that use non-TARP funds. Incentive payments for modifications to loans owned or guaranteed by the GSEs are paid by the GSEs, not TARP. Treasury over time expanded MHA to include sub-programs designed to overcome obstacles to sustainable HAMP modifications. Treasury also allocated TARP funds to support two additional housing support efforts: an FHA refinancing program and TARP funding for 19 state housing finance agencies, called the Housing Finance Agency Hardest Hit Fund. In the first half of 2012, Treasury extended the application period for HAMP by a year to December 31, 2013, and opened HAMP to non-owner-occupied rental properties and to consumers with a wider range of debt-to-income ratios under \u201cHAMP Tier 2.\u201d",

Each of these data sources was not necessarily relevant to each of the rulemakings. The Bureau used the additional data from NMLS and NMLS Mortgage Call Report data to better corroborate its estimate of the contours of the non-depository segment of the mortgage market. The Bureau has received loan file extracts from three lenders, but at this point, the data from one lender is not usable and the data from the other two is not sufficiently standardized nor representative to inform consideration of the final rules. Additionally, the Bureau has thus far not yet received data from the National Mortgage Database pilot phases. The Bureau also requested that commenters submit relevant data. All probative data submitted by commenters are discussed in this document.",

        "162": "Consumers who expect to pay the balance of their loan prior to maturity can purchase from creditors the sole right to choose the date of this payoff. This right is valuable and its price is the market value such a sale creates for creditors in regard to the date of this potential payoff. Creditors exchange rights with consumers but in the opposite direction with \u201ccallable\u201d bonds. This type of bond exhibits an exactly opposite trade, in which the borrower cedes to the creditor the choice of time at which the creditor can require, if it chooses, the borrower to remit the remaining value of the bond.", 
        "163": "The two options are not mutually exclusive. In some transactions, consumers may pay for the embedded option through more than one of the methods outlined. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> Donald Keenan &amp; James J Kau, <em data-original=\"E-03\">An Overview of the Option-Theoretic Pricing of Mortgages,</em> 6 Journal of Housing Research 217 (1995) (providing an overview of options embedded in residential mortgages); James J Kau, Donald Keenan, Walter Muller &amp; James Epperson, <em data-original=\"E-03\">A Generalized Valuation Model for Fixed-Rate Mortgages with Default and Prepayment,</em> 11 Journal of Real Estate Finance &amp; Economics 5 (1995) (providing a traditional method to value these options numerically); Robert R.

        "164": "Similarly, consumers who expect to pay their loans over a period sufficiently short as to make the purchase of discount loans unattractive may find it better at the end of this expected period to continue to pay their mortgage and, consequently, suffer an unanticipated loss from refraining from the purchase of points. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Yan Chang &amp; Abdullah Yavas, <em data-original=\"E-03\">Do Borrowers Make Rational Choices on Points and Refinancing?,</em> 37 Real Estate Economics 635 (2009) (offering empirical evidence that consumers in their sample data remain in their current fixed-rate mortgages for too short a time to recover their initial investment in discount points). Other empirical evidence, however, conflicts with these results in regard to both the frequency and magnitude of losses. Simple numerical calculations that take into account taxes, local volatility in property values, and returns on alternative assets highlight the difficulty in drawing conclusions from much of the empirical data.", 
        "165": "Such a circumstance includes, for example, the case in which the need to understand and decide among loans with different points and fees combinations imposes a burden on some consumers. The existence of increased choice made available by this provision would, in this case, be itself a cost to the consumer. Based on standard economic reasoning, the Bureau believes, however, that the circumstances in which the exercise of its exemption authority has the potential to reduce consumer welfare, relative to the statutory prohibition, are, for the most part, quite rare.", 
        "166": "The choice over the means by which consumers compensate creditors for the prepayment option is of particular potential benefit to consumers who currently enjoy high liquidity but who either face prospects of diminished liquidity in the future or are more sensitive to the risk posed by a high variance in their future income or wealth. Examples of such consumers include retiring or older individuals wishing to secure their future housing, individuals who are otherwise predisposed to use their wealth for a one-time payment, consumers with relocation funds available, and consumers offered certain rebates by developers or other sellers. In situations where consumers are unaware of their own circumstance or their own relative financial acuity, some creditors may be able to benefit. For example, an unethical creditor may persuade those consumers unaware of their lower relative financial ability to make incorrect decisions regarding purchasing points. The outcome of this type of adverse selection will be reversed when consumers have a more accurate knowledge of their financial abilities than does the creditor.", 
        "167": "Conversely, the elimination of the option to pay upfront points and fees could, depending on the extant risk in creditors' portfolios and their perceptions of differential risk between neighborhoods, seriously reduce the access to mortgage credit for some consumers.", 
        "168": "In contrast, the prohibition on payment of upfront points and fees in the Dodd-Frank Act under most circumstances would ensure that the value of the option to share risk through discount points is lost to both the creditor and the consumer in those circumstances. Absent other means of hedging prepayment risk, creditors would either need to reduce the volume of loans they originate or incur greater costs of raising capital to fund such loans, owing to the increased risk to their business and, consequently, to their solvency.", 
        "169": "Credible signaling in such a situation, from the creditor's perspective, distinguishes two groups of consumers\u2014one with low prepayment risk who purchase discount points, and the second a group not purchasing discount points and, consequently, expect to prepay their loan more rapidly than average\u2014in what would otherwise be a pool of consumers who are perceived by the creditor to exhibit an equivalent measure of prepayment risk.", 
        "17": "The Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage. HARP is designed for those homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments but have been unable to get traditional refinancing because the value of their homes has declined. For a mortgage to be considered for a HARP refinance, it <em data-original=\"E-03\">must</em> be owned or guaranteed by the GSEs. HARP ends on December 31, 2013.", 
        "170": "In this situation where the efficiency of the market is only impaired by adverse selection, this increase in creditor returns is independent of whether the creditor sells loans in the secondary market or chooses to engage in hedging to hold these mortgages in portfolio.", 
        "171": "Moral hazard, in the current context of mortgage origination, depends fundamentally on the advantage the loan originator has in knowing the least expensive transaction terms acceptable to creditors and greater overall knowledge of the functioning of mortgage markets. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> Holden Lewis, <em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Moral Hazard&#8221; Helps Shape Mortgage Mess,</em> Bankrate (Apr. 18, 2007), <em data-original=\"E-03\">available at</em>\n              <em data-original=\"E-03\">http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/mortgages/20070418_subprime_mortgage_morality_a1.asp</em> (providing a practitioner description of the costs of such moral hazard on the current mortgage and housing industries).",

        "173": "As noted in the section-by-section analysis, the Bureau issued CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 in response to the questions it received regarding the applicability of the current regulation to designated plans and non-designated plans, and this regulation is intended in part to provide further clarity on such issues. Until the final rule goes into effect, the clarifications in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 will remain in effect.",

        "176": "When multiple originators are working for a given loan originator organization or creditor, the compensation to each individual loan originator will depend upon on the aggregate efforts of all the loan originators working for this entity, rather than directly on the individual loan originator's own performance. Consequently, if we compare the efforts of an individual loan originator working for a smaller entity with those of another individual at a larger entity, the effort by the individual at the larger entity will be less than the effort of the individual at the smaller entity, owing to the smaller influence any individual at the larger entity has on the amount of compensation awarded to the individual. This relationship between individual effort and the total number of peers in a given entity is termed \u201cfree-riding.\u201d Free riding behavior has been extensively analyzed: Surveys of these analyses appear in Martin L. Weitzman, <em data-original=\"E-03\">Incentive Effects of Profit Sharing, in Trends in Business Organization: Do Participation and Cooperation Increase Competitiveness?</em> (Kiel Inst. of World Econs.1995), <em data-original=\"E-03\">available at</em>\n              <em data-original=\"E-03\">http://ws1.ad.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/IncentiveEffectsProfitSharing.pdf.</em> ;",

No principle with such generality has been shown, however, in regard to the rate of this decline and the amount of individual work effort for any particular group of employees. Features of the means by which profits are distributed to individuals and the individual's environment within a given firm, such as the individual's ability to observe the performance of his peers and the frequency of managerial monitoring of individual performance, strongly affect these variables, as shown in a number of recent studies, including empirical and experimental research papers: Susan Helper, et al., <em data-original=\"E-03\">Analyzing Compensation Methods in Manufacturing: Piece Rates, Time Rates, or Gain-Sharing?,</em> (NBER Working Paper No. 16540, 2010); R.

                "Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added TILA section 129C(e)(1), which prohibits a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or an extension of open-end consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling from containing terms that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for resolving disputes arising out of the transaction. TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that, subject to TILA section 129C(e)(3) a consumer and creditor or any assignee may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may be applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law.", 
                "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.36(h) to implement these statutory provisions, pursuant to TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2) would have clarified the interaction between TILA sections 129C(e)(2) and (e)(3), and the section-by-section analysis noted that TILA section 129C(e)(3) and \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2) do not address State law causes of action.", 
                "Commenters generally supported the proposal. Although some commenters addressed details of the substance of the proposal, many commenters addressed the timing of the provisions' implementation. For example, several consumer groups stated that the proposal did not make any substantive changes to the statutory provisions and should be withdrawn because there was no reason to delay the effective date of the statutory provisions. One commenter acknowledged that the provisions were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act but urged the Bureau to encourage mandatory arbitration anyway. SBA Advocacy stated that some Small Entity Representatives did not understand why the provisions were being included in this rule and asked the Bureau to consider adopting it at a later date. A bank association commenter urged the Bureau to delay the provisions until after it completed its required general study of arbitration clauses in consumer transactions, pursuant to section 1028 of the Dodd-Frank Act.", 
                "One commenter requested clarification on whether the provisions apply to waivers of rights to a jury trial. Other commenters questioned variously whether the proposal altered the statutory provisions: By applying the provision on waivers of causes of action to post-dispute agreements; by applying that provision to loans other than residential mortgage loans and open-end consumer credit plans secured by a principal dwelling; by limiting it to Federal causes of action; or by prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts and agreements other than the note and agreements related to the note. One commenter stated that the applicability of the proposed rule provisions was confusing because the provisions refer to consumer transactions secured by a dwelling but their scope is also addressed separately in proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j). (Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j) is finalized as \u00a7 1026.36(b) of the rule.) Finally, one commenter suggested that the statute and the rule would prohibit nonjudicial foreclosures and prevent a servicer from settling a dispute with a consumer through a settlement agreement.", 
                "The provisions on mandatory arbitration and waiver are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent action by the Bureau, they would take effect on January 21, 2013. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to provide implementing language to facilitate compliance with the statute. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes the point made by several commenters regarding the importance of these consumer protections. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provisions by regulation does not require the Bureau to delay the provisions' effective date for an extended period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of these statutory protections within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period because the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims have been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, and this final rule will not require extensive changes to origination systems. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not accept loans that require arbitration or other nonjudicial procedures to resolve disputes, so the Bureau believes this aspect of the statute and final rule will not necessitate significant changes to current practices in most circumstances. The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, in order to provide industry a short period to make any needed adjustments.", 
                "In response to the comments, the Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit waivers of rights to a jury trial because bench trials are judicial procedures, not nonjudicial procedures. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(1) to limit deeds of trust providing for nonjudicial foreclosure because such instruments are not agreements to use nonjudicial procedures to resolve controversies or settle claims arising out of the transaction, in contrast with agreements to use arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Nor does the Bureau interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit nonjudicial foreclosures because nonjudicial foreclosures still allow consumers to bring actions in court alleging violations of Federal law.", 
                "Similarly, the Bureau does not interpret the statute to bar settlement agreements. Such a result would be a highly unusual\u2014perhaps unprecedented\u2014prohibition, and the Bureau believes that Congress would have spoken expressly about settlement agreements if that was the result it intended.\n            Instead, the Bureau reads the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to settle the dispute or claim, the settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the regulatory text to clarify that \u00a7 1026.36(h) does not limit a consumer and creditor or any assignee from agreeing, after a dispute or claim under the transaction arises, to settle that dispute or claim. Under TILA section 129C(e)(3) and \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2), however, no settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.", 
                "The Bureau is further revising the regulatory text to address the belief of some commenters that the Bureau had altered the scope of the statutory provision. As discussed above, TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that the exception for post-dispute agreements from the prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements is itself subject to the prohibition on waivers of rights to bring Federal causes of action in court. The proposal specified that a post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure could not limit the ability of the consumer to bring a covered claim through the agreed-upon procedure. This final rule clarifies that, consistent with the discussion of waivers of causes of action in settlement agreements above, the Bureau interprets the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure to resolve that dispute or claim, the agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring <em data-original=\"E-03\">that</em> dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. The Bureau believes that, in such an instance, the consumer is aware of the specific dispute or claim at issue and is therefore in a better position to make a knowing decision whether to resolve the dispute or claim without bringing an action in court. But no post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.", 
                "The Bureau disagrees with commenters who stated it had expanded the scope of TILA section 129C(e) to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j) (implemented in this final rule as \u00a7 1026.36(b)) clarifies the scope of each of the other substantive paragraphs in \u00a7 1026.36 and provides that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which \u00a7 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. However, to reduce uncertainty, the Bureau is including a statement in \u00a7 1026.36(h) that it is applicable to \u201ca home equity line of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.\u201d", 
                "The Bureau also disagrees that the proposed language changed the scope of the prohibition on waivers of causes of action by including the word \u201cFederal\u201d in the paragraph (h)(2) heading, \u201cNo waivers of Federal statutory causes of action.\u201d The contents of paragraph (h)(2) and the corresponding statutory paragraph (e)(3) both provide that the prohibition applies to alleged violations of Section 129C of TILA, any other provision of TILA, or any other Federal law. Thus, the scope of the statutory prohibition is limited to Federal law, and the implementing regulation is properly so limited.", 
                "Finally, the Bureau disagrees that the prohibition on agreements to use mandatory arbitration applies only to the note itself. TILA section 129C(e)(1) provides that it applies to the terms of a residential mortgage loan and to an extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. The terms of such transactions are frequently memorialized in multiple documents. Plainly, the prohibition cannot be evaded simply by including a provision for mandatory arbitration in a document other than the note if that document is executed as part of the transaction. The prohibition applies to the terms of the whole transaction, regardless of which particular document contains those terms. However, to prevent any misunderstanding that the prohibition applies to agreements that are not part of the credit transaction, the Bureau is replacing the phrase \u201ccontract or agreement in connection with a\u201d consumer credit transaction with the phrase \u201ccontract or other agreement for\u201d a consumer credit transaction."
