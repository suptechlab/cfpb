    "abstract": "The OCC, Board, FDIC, NCUA, Bureau, and FHFA (collectively, the Agencies) are adopting a final rule to implement the minimum requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) to be applied by participating States in the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies (AMCs). The final rule also implements the minimum requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act for AMCs that are subsidiaries owned and controlled by an insured depository institution and regulated by a Federal financial institutions regulatory agency (Federally regulated AMCs). Under the final rule, these Federally regulated AMCs do not need to register with a State, but are subject to the same minimum requirements as State-regulated AMCs. The final rule also implements the requirement for States to report to the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) the information required by the ASC to administer the new national registry of AMCs (AMC National Registry). In conjunction with this implementation, the FDIC is integrating its appraisal regulations for State nonmember banks and State savings associations.",

Given this definition, participating States are not small governmental jurisdictions and the burden on them is not relevant to this analysis.", 
        "123": "The Bureau does not assume costs associated with the final rule's requirements to ensure compliance with USPAP and other regulations, because AMCs would be subject to these standards even without their being referenced in the final rule.", 
        "124": "A State could accept the consequences on AMCs' business in the State from not implementing the final rule. FIRREA section 1124(f) provides that three years after the final rule takes effect, AMCs cannot provide services in Federally related transactions unless and until a State has implemented the final rule. However, the Bureau understands that only a minority of mortgage transactions are \u201cFederally related transactions\u201d within the meaning of FIRREA. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> 12 CFR 225.62(f) (transaction must &#8220;[r]equire the services of an appraiser&#8221; to be federally related). <em data-original=\"E-03\">But see id.</em> at &#167; 225.63(a)(1),(9),(10) (exemptions from FIRREA appraisal requirements for transactions of $250,000 or less, transactions insured by or sold to a U.S. government agency, and transactions that conform to GSE appraisal standards). However, the Bureau believes all States will choose to participate. Several industry comments expressed concerns with the possible consequences if States did not participate. These comments did not establish that it was likely that States would not do so, however. Thus, the Bureau continues to rely on the assumption that the remaining States will choose to participate either within three years or soon thereafter. However, even if this is not the case, the transactions affected until a State did participate would be portfolio loans over $250,000 that are not insured by either the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), or the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service (USDA RHS). These loans represent a small percentage of the market, and therefore inability by certain market participants (certain types of AMCs) to provide appraisal management services in these types of transactions in a non-participating State will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.", 
        "125": "<em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 U.S.C. 3338. This provision in FIRREA is not part of the joint rulemaking authority in section 1124 that is the basis for the Agencies' issuance of this final rule.",

        "127": "<em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> Vermont Statutes Title 26 section 3324 (requiring AMCs to &#8220;retain all records related to an appraisal, review, or consulting assignment for no less than five years . . .

        "128": "In addition, the Bureau does not believe that in States that add this requirement there will be any significant new burden on the AMCs. The Bureau believes that the AMCs already keep their books and records in order as a standard course of business practice, and thus the occasional State examiner visits should not impose any significant burden. In addition, the final rule requires only that the State have the authority and mechanism to request records and information. The final rule does not require that the State exercise this authority and any burdensome exercise of this authority would therefore not be caused by the final rule. Finally, to the extent State supervision programs do increase burden, the Bureau believes this burden would be within the sensitivity tolerances described in the footnote at the end of this section.", 
        "129": "These requirements also would not result in new burden on Federally regulated AMCs, for the same reason. Federally regulated AMCs do not have to comply with State registration and renewal requirements, which can entail fees. Conservatively, however, the Bureau applied the State fee burden to all of the small AMCs in its calculation method described herein. As a result, the estimated burden of State fees associated with the final rule may be over-estimated.",

The percentages of institutions for which this cost would amount to over 1 percent of the revenue changed, respectively, to 26 percent, 18 percent, and 15 percent of the small institutions affected, according to the normal, generalized extreme value, and logistic distributions.",
