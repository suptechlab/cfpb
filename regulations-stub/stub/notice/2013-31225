    "abstract": "The Bureau is amending the official commentary that interprets the requirements of the Bureau's Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to reflect a change in the asset size threshold for certain creditors to qualify for an exemption to the requirement to establish an escrow account for a higher-priced mortgage loan based on the annual percentage change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the 12-month period ending in November. The exemption threshold is adjusted to increase to $2.028 billion from $2 billion. The adjustment is based on the 1.4 percent increase in the average of the CPI-W for the 12-month period ending in November 2013. Therefore, creditors with assets of $2.028 billion or less as of December 31, 2013, are exempt, if other requirements of Regulation Z also are met, from establishing escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans in 2014.",
