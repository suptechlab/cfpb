    "abstract": "This final rule amends some of the final mortgage rules issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) in January 2013. These amendments focus primarily on loss mitigation procedures under Regulation X's servicing provisions, amounts counted as loan originator compensation to retailers of manufactured homes and their employees for purposes of applying points and fees thresholds under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act and the Ability-to-Repay rules in Regulation Z, exemptions available to creditors that operate predominantly in ``rural or underserved'' areas for various purposes under the mortgage regulations, application of the loan originator compensation rules to bank tellers and similar staff, and the prohibition on creditor-financed credit insurance. The Bureau also is adjusting the effective dates for certain provisions of the loan originator compensation rules. In addition, the Bureau is adopting technical and wording changes for clarification purposes to Regulations B, X, and Z.",

As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Dodd-Frank Act section 1474 amended ECOA by, among other things, defining \u201cvaluation\u201d to include any <em data-original=\"E-03\">estimate</em> of the value of the dwelling developed in connection with a creditor's decisions to provide credit. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> ECOA section 701(e)(6). Similarly, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule adopted &#167; 1002.14(b)(3), which defines &#8220;valuation&#8221; as any <em data-original=\"E-03\">estimate</em> of the value of a dwelling developed in connection with an application for credit. Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau intended the term &#8220;valuation&#8221; to refer only to an estimate for purposes of the 2013 ECOA Final Rule's newly adopted provisions. However, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule added two comments that refer to a valuation as an appraiser's estimate or opinion of the value of the property: comment 14(b)(3)-1.i, which gives examples of &#8220;valuations,&#8221; as defined by &#167; 1002.14(b)(3); and comment 14(b)(3)-3.v, which provides examples of documents that discuss or restate a valuation of an applicant's property but nevertheless do not constitute &#8220;valuations&#8221; under &#167; 1002.14(b)(3).", 
                                "Because the Bureau did not intend by these two comments to alter the meaning of \u201cvaluation\u201d to become inconsistent with ECOA section 701(e)(6) and \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3), the Bureau proposed to clarify comments 14(b)(3)-1.i and 14(b)(3)-3.v by removing the words \u201cor opinion\u201d from their texts, and sought comment on the clarification."

This commenter also pointed out that appraisals are generally not considered to be \u201cestimates,\u201d and thus the application of the rule to appraisals could be confusing in light of the proposed change.

                                "The Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(3)-1.i as proposed with some additional modifications, and also is adding new comment 14(b)(3)-3.vi based on the trade association comment. In proposing these amendments, the Bureau intended to clarify that the comments referred to appraisals or other valuation models by removing the word \u201copinion,\u201d which could be read broadly to include even speculative opinions not based on an appraisal or other valuation model. However, in light of the trade association's comments the Bureau believes that simply deleting the word \u201copinion\u201d could also cause confusion regarding whether and how the rule applies to appraisals that are commonly described as \u201copinions of value.\u201d Thus, the Bureau is substituting \u201copinion of value\u201d for \u201copinion\u201d rather than deleting the word entirely. The Bureau is adopting revised comment 14(b)(3)-1.i with this change. The Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(3)-3.v as proposed, and does not believe any additional revisions are necessary in light of this clarification, because the comment deals exclusively with reports reflecting property inspections and not appraisals. However, the Bureau is adding new comment 14(b)(3)-3.vi to clarify that appraisal reviews that do not provide an estimate of value or \u201copinion of value\u201d are included in the list of examples of items that are not considered \u201cvaluations\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3)."
