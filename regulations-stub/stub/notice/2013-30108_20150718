    "abstract": "The Board, Bureau, FDIC, FHFA, NCUA, and OCC (collectively, the Agencies) are amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the official interpretation to the regulation. This final rule supplements a final rule issued by the Agencies on January 18, 2013, which goes into effect on January 18, 2014. The January 2013 Final Rule implements a provision added to TILA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd- Frank Act or Act) requiring appraisals for ``higher-risk mortgages.'' For certain mortgages with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate by a specified percentage, the January 2013 Final Rule requires creditors to obtain an appraisal or appraisals meeting certain specified standards, provide applicants with a notification regarding the use of the appraisals, and give applicants a copy of the written appraisals used. On July 10, 2013, the Agencies proposed amendments to the January 2013 Final Rule implementing these requirements. Specifically, the Agencies proposed exemptions from the rules for transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land; certain streamlined refinancings; and transactions of $25,000 or less.",

Moreover, the Bureau believes that about 90 percent of refinance transactions would have an appraisal provided to consumers because the creditor chose to have an appraisal and provided a copy due to the ECOA Valuations Rule. Thus, this exemption is likely to affect under 1,000 loans a year. The Agencies do not possess reliable, representative data on how many refinances will qualify for this exemption. However, to the extent refinances previously would not have been eligible for exemptions to this rule, the Agencies believe that going forward most such refinances will be restructured as qualified mortgages or otherwise to satisfy the criteria of this exemption for certain refinances. The Agencies used the same assumption for the supplemental proposal and did not receive any comments indicating otherwise. Accordingly, the Table below reflects this assumption.

                                "The community bank trade association stated that appraisals increase costs to manufactured home borrowers who often have low incomes. In the view of this commenter, credit risk on portfolio lending and underwriting standards for secondary market transactions provide sufficient incentives for creditors to select appropriate alternative valuation methods, which include a variety of methods other than an appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA based upon a physical inspection of the interior of the property as required by the HPML appraisal rules. In addition, according to this commenter, some community banks report that appraisers can be readily engaged for manufactured housing transactions in general; for others, however, appraisers are reportedly difficult to find or appraisals are more costly or take longer than in-house non-appraisal valuations. The State manufactured housing trade association also referred to difficulties with obtaining appraisals for these loans. This commenter expressed the view that creditors should be subject only to an appraisal requirement when participating in a government or GSE program that imposes such a requirement.", 
                                "One of the nonbank lenders stated that these transactions should be exempt due to a lack of sufficient appraisers and a lack of sufficient data on comparable sales (\u201ccomparables\u201d) of manufactured homes, particularly in rural areas. This commenter also raised concerns about costs, noting that appraisals with interior inspections could, in this lender's experience, raise loan cost by 68 to 81 basis points. In addition, the lender noted that in the 6 percent of its 2012 manufactured home transactions secured by land and home that were subject to a similar HUD appraisal requirement, the collateral did not appraise at or above the sales price in 30 percent of transactions. In the view of this lender, these outcomes were due in significant part to an inappropriate emphasis in the HUD program on the use of manufactured homes as comparables. The other nonbank lender stated that an appraisal for transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and land would be unreliable and a misuse of consumer funds. This commenter also noted that it already complies with appraisal disclosure requirements in Regulation B.\n            Finally, as noted above, a national trade association for manufactured housing endorsed the comments of these manufactured home lenders."

                                "Consistent with the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the final rule that goes into effect July 18, 2015, does not exempt loans secured by an existing manufactured home and land from the HPML appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3) through (6).\n            Covering transactions secured by an existing home and land is consistent with the requirements of the GSEs and Federal government agencies for these types of loans.", 
                                "In addition, the Agencies received information from manufactured home lender representatives who indicated that obtaining appraisals in conformity with USPAP that include interior inspections for loans secured by an existing manufactured home and land is not uncommon among manufactured home creditors. Some lender commenters on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule supported applying the HPML appraisal rules to these transactions as consistent with prudent lending practices.", 
                                "Moreover, the Agencies obtained comments on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule from consumer advocates, affordable housing organizations, and other stakeholders, but had not had the benefit of comments from these stakeholders on the 2012 Proposed Rule. As discussed above, consumer and affordable housing advocates strongly supported applying the HPML appraisal requirements to transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and land. They argued, among other things, that consumers would thereby obtain information about the value of their homes that would account more thoroughly for the value added to a home by the land on which the existing home is or will be placed. Similar comments were submitted by a national real estate trade organization, a policy and research organization, and a national association of owners of manufactured homes.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Appraiser organizations that submitted written comments and appraisers consulted by the Agencies in informal outreach also strongly recommended that the HPML appraisal rules be adopted for transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and land. They indicated that the appraisal methods for appraising existing manufactured homes and land are the same as for site-built homes and land. Their comments suggested that appraisals with interior inspections for these homes are common and that prudent lending practice and consumer protection are best served by obtaining appraisals for transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and land together, including a physical inspection of the interior of the home.", 
                                "As noted, one manufactured home lender commenter expressed concerns about applying the HPML appraisal rules to loans secured by existing manufactured homes and land when the home has been moved from its previous site to a dealer's lot. Transactions secured by an existing home that has been moved to a dealer's lot and land can still be appraised in conformity with USPAP, which does not require that the home first be sited before an appraiser performs the appraisal. The Agencies understand that the home could be inspected on the dealer's lot, for example, or once the home is re-sited. The Agencies also note that several commenters asserted that existing manufactured homes are rarely moved. For these reasons, the Agencies believe that an appraisal with an interior inspection that values the home and land together is still warranted for these properties.", 
                                "Based on these comments and related outreach, the Agencies do not believe that exempting loans secured by a manufactured home and land from the HPML appraisal requirements would be in the public interest or promote the safety and soundness of creditors. The Agencies believe that covering these loans will help ensure that consumers are aware of information related to the value of their manufactured home before consummating an HPML (that is not a qualified mortgage). The Agencies also believe that covering these loans will facilitate the development of greater consistency between the rules and practices applicable to transactions secured by site-built homes and manufactured homes. The Agencies believe that this consistency of rules and practices will contribute to integrating manufactured home lending more fully into the broader mortgage market over time, which could have long-term benefits for consumers and lenders.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that most lenders of manufactured home loans obtain appraisals in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for loans secured by existing manufactured homes and land. However, the Agencies understand that not all manufactured home lenders may do so, or do so consistently, and are mindful that smaller lenders in particular may need more time to comply. Therefore, the final rule gives the industry 18 months before compliance with the HPML appraisal requirements is mandatory for these transactions."

                                "In the January 2013 Final Rule, the Agencies adopted an exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements for loans secured by a \u201cnew manufactured home.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 78 FR 10368, 10379-10380, 10433, 10438, 10444 (Feb. 13, 2013). In the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies stated that, after issuing the January 2013 Final Rule, the Agencies obtained additional information on valuation methods for manufactured homes. Based on this information, the Agencies requested comment and information concerning whether to require USPAP-compliant appraisals with interior property inspections conducted by a state-licensed or -certified appraiser for HPMLs secured by both a new manufactured home and land. The Agencies also sought comment on whether some other valuation method should be required as a condition of the exemption for these transactions from the general HPML appraisal requirements in &#167; 1026.35(c)(3) through (c)(6).", 
                                "In particular, the Agencies noted that appraisers and State appraiser boards consulted in outreach efforts confirmed that real property appraisals in conformity with USPAP are possible and conducted with at least some regularity in transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land. The Agencies expressed their understanding that these appraisals value the site and the home together based upon comparable transactions that have been exposed to the open market (as would be done with a site-built home or any other existing home).\n            The Agencies further noted that these appraisals could document additional value based on factors such as the home's location, and in some cases could identify visible discrepancies between the manufacturer's specifications and the actual home once it is sited.", 
                                "In the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies also observed that USPAP-compliant real property appraisals are regularly conducted for all transactions under Federal government agency and GSE manufactured home loan programs.\n            FHA Title II program standards, for example, which apply to transactions secured by a manufactured home and land titled together as real property, require an appraisal in conformity with USPAP.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Agencies noted further that in informal outreach, a representative of manufactured home appraisers and a manufactured home CDFI representative stated that they conduct appraisals for loans secured by a new manufactured home and land before the home is sited based on plans and specifications for the new home.\n            An interior property inspection occurs once the home is sited (although the CDFI representative indicated that it did not always use a state-certified or -licensed appraiser for the final inspection). These outreach participants suggested that, in their experience, qualified certified- or -licensed appraisers and appropriate comparables are not unduly difficult to find to perform these appraisals, even in rural areas.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Agencies noted that manufactured home lenders commenting on the 2012 Proposed Rule and during informal outreach raised concerns that comparables of other manufactured homes can be particularly difficult to find. The Agencies expressed their understanding that a lack of appropriate comparables can be a barrier to obtaining a manufactured home appraisal, especially in certain loan programs that require appraisals of manufactured homes to use a certain number of manufactured home comparables and have other restrictions on the comparables that may be used.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Agencies noted, however, that USPAP does not require that manufactured home comparables be used. USPAP allows the appraiser to use site-built or other types of home construction as comparables with adjustments where necessary.\n            The Agencies also stated that a current version of an Appraisal Institute seminar on manufactured housing appraisals confirmed that when necessary, USPAP appraisals can use non-manufactured homes as comparables, making adjustments where needed.\n            \n          ", 
                                "At the same time, the Agencies sought information about the potential impact on the industry and consumers of requiring real property appraisals in conformity with USPAP that include interior inspections in transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land (where these types of appraisals are not already required). In this regard, the Agencies noted that several manufactured home lenders commented on the 2012 Proposed Rule and shared in informal outreach that they typically do not conduct an appraisal with an interior inspection of a new manufactured home, but use other methods, such as relying on the manufacturer's invoice as a baseline for the value of the new home and conducting a separate appraisal of the land in conformity with USPAP.\n            Thus, the Agencies observed that requiring a USPAP-compliant appraisal with an interior inspection could require systems changes for some manufactured home lenders. In addition, the Agencies also noted the possibility that, if the appraisals required under the 2013 January Final Rule were more expensive than existing methods, imposing the HPML appraisal requirements would lead to additional costs that could be passed on in whole or in part to consumers.", 
                                "Accordingly, the Agencies requested data on the extent to which an appraisal in conformity with USPAP with an interior property inspection would be of comparable cost to, or more or less expensive than, a separate USPAP-compliant appraisal of a lot added together with an invoice price for the home unit. The Agencies also requested comment on the potential burdens on creditors and consumers and any potential reduction in access to credit that might result from imposing requirements for an appraisal in conformity with USPAP that includes an interior property inspection on all manufactured home creditors of HPMLs secured by both a new manufactured home and land. In this regard, the Agencies asked commenters to bear in mind that any of these transactions that are qualified mortgages are exempt from the HPML appraisal requirements under the separate exemption for qualified mortgages. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(i). Finally, the Agencies requested comment on whether and the extent to which consumers in these transactions typically receive information about the value of their land and home and, if so, what information is received."

                                "Eighteen commenters responded to the Agencies' questions about the exemption for transactions secured by both a new manufactured home and land. These commenters comprised four national appraiser trade associations, a State credit union trade association, a credit union, a national manufactured housing industry trade association, a national association for owners of manufactured homes, two manufactured housing lenders, a consumer advocate group, three affordable housing organizations, a policy and research organization, a State manufactured housing industry trade association, a real estate trade association, and a mortgage banking trade association.", 
                                "Commenters had varying opinions on whether the exemption for transactions secured by both a new manufactured home and land was appropriate. Four national appraiser trade associations, a credit union, a national association for owners of manufactured homes, a consumer advocate group, three affordable housing organizations, a policy and research organization, and a real estate trade association opposed the exemption. Two of the national appraiser trade associations asserted that the exemption for transactions secured by new manufactured homes and land did not meet the statutory exemption criteria of being in the public interest and promoting the safety and soundness of creditors.\n            These commenters also believed that the January 2013 Final Rule and the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule lacked public policy consistency because loans secured by a manufactured home and land would be treated differently based on whether the home is existing or new, even though both are real estate-secured transactions. A real estate trade association and two national appraiser trade associations noted that the exemption was inconsistent with the manufactured housing appraisal requirements of HUD, VA, and GSE manufactured housing loan programs.", 
                                "A credit union commenter expressed the view that an appraisal with an interior inspection in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA is the only method of valuation that properly accounts for all valuation factors, including the property's location and discrepancies between the manufacturer's specifications and the home itself. Similarly, two national appraiser trade associations argued that this type of appraisal was necessary because the price of a manufactured home may not necessarily reflect its value, due to factors such as the quality of installation and construction of the home. Two national appraiser trade associations, a manufactured housing lender, and a real estate trade association stated that an appraisal in conformity with USPAP of a lot combined with an invoice price for the home unit (as opposed to valuing the home and land as a single item of real property) was an incorrect form of valuation that would not provide a credible indication of the value of the home and land combined.", 
                                "Several commenters emphasized that performing appraisals in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for these transactions is feasible. An affordable housing commenter argued that, for new manufactured homes that are not yet sited, appraisers can follow standards in USPAP for appraising site-built homes that are not yet constructed. Under these existing USPAP standards, an appraisal is based on a site inspection and the plans and specifications of the home.\n            When the construction is complete, an appraiser or qualified inspector can confirm whether the finished home meets the same specifications.", 
                                "According to national appraiser trade associations, appraisals in conformity with USPAP are regularly performed for transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land. These commenters stated that professional appraisers for manufactured homes are widely available, that appropriate comparables can be readily found, and that USPAP protocols (including interior inspections) are appropriate for valuing manufactured housing and land. Two affordable housing organizations, a consumer advocate group, a policy and research organization, and a national association of owners of manufactured homes believed that the same appraisal requirements should apply to transactions secured by a new manufactured home as apply to transactions secured by site-built homes. They believed, however, that appraisers should have more flexibility in manufactured home transactions to use site-built homes as comparables than some Federal government agency and GSE programs currently allow.", 
                                "Two affordable housing organizations, a consumer advocate group, a policy and research organization, and a national association for owners of manufactured homes believed that transactions secured by a new manufactured home should be subject to the rule if the homeowner owns the land on which the home is sited, even if the home is not subject to a security interest. Another affordable housing organization recommended that new manufactured homes should be subject to the rule, whether affixed to owned land or on land with a long term lease.", 
                                "In contrast, six commenters\u2014a national mortgage banking association, a State credit union association, two manufactured housing lenders, a national manufactured housing trade association, and a State manufactured housing trade association\u2014supported the exemption for transactions secured by both a new manufactured home and land. Some of these commenters asserted that an exemption was necessary because a physical interior inspection was infeasible. In this regard, the manufactured housing lender stated that a new manufactured home typically will not be delivered and installed until after a loan closes. The commenter noted that, as with construction loans, which are provided an exemption from the HPML appraisal rules (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(iv)), on-site interior inspections of new manufactured homes that will secure loans are not feasible because they are still being manufactured, delivered, or installed when appraisals would need to be ordered. Similarly, a State manufactured housing industry trade association stated that a manufactured home's production does not begin before the determination is made to provide credit to a consumer, so a physical inspection prior to closing would be impossible.\n            \n          ", 
                                "A national manufactured housing industry trade association also questioned the value of an interior inspection of new manufactured homes, stating that each manufactured home is built to the specifications of the retailer and is manufactured in a controlled manufacturing process in accordance with HUD standards, which ensures the application of consistent, quality standards.\n            According to this commenter, the manufacturer certifies to the retailer the authenticity and accuracy of the wholesale cost of the home at the point of manufacture.", 
                                "Some commenters noted that even though appraisals in conformity with USPAP are required by some Federal government agencies and GSE manufactured housing loan programs, they are not performed frequently. One manufactured housing lender stated that traditional appraisals typically are performed only for certain FHA loans that represent a small fraction of overall land/home manufactured housing loans.\n            A State manufactured housing industry trade association offered similar comments. The State manufactured housing industry trade association commenter also asserted that GSE-like appraisal requirements were not appropriate for these transactions, because most new manufactured home loans are held in portfolio and creditors will set valuation standards appropriate for their own loans.", 
                                "Commenters also challenged the accuracy of appraisals performed in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for transactions secured by both a new manufactured home and land. A manufactured housing lender stated that, even for FHA-insured land/home loans, traditional appraisals are prone to yielding appraised values that are lower than the sales price of the home. A national manufactured housing industry trade association stated that traditional appraisals produce appraised values lower than the sales price for more than 20 percent of transactions that are secured by manufactured homes and land. One manufactured housing lender stated that for its loans for which appraisals are ordered, appraisals resulted in appraised values lower than the sales price around 30 percent of the time. Similarly, the State manufactured housing industry trade association stated that, based on information from its members, the rate of appraisals with appraised values lower than the sales price is approximately 30 percent.", 
                                "Commenters also cited problems with obtaining comparables as contributing to the difficulty with obtaining accurate appraisals. Manufactured housing lenders, a national manufactured housing industry trade association, and a State manufactured housing industry trade association stated that manufactured home comparables, especially in rural areas, tend to be unavailable or inadequate. One lender noted that, in practice, HUD will permit site-built comparables for the Title II FHA loan insurance program in the absence of appropriate manufacturer home comparables, but only on a limited basis. A manufactured housing lender also asserted that relying upon site-built homes as comparables can lead to inflated values.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing industry trade association and a State manufactured housing industry trade association asserted that no reliable database of previous sales which appraisers can use to develop an accurate, reliable value for manufactured homes exists. The State manufactured housing industry trade association believed that actual sales data must serve as the foundation for any valuation system. The commenter believed that creating such a database would involve both time and expense, and that such a database should not be created by private industry or based upon the voluntary submission of sales price data. This commenter expressed the view that such a database should be created by State governments.", 
                                "Several commenters believed that issues with appraisers are the cause of manufactured housing appraisals resulting in values lower than the sales price. A manufactured housing lender believed that significant appraiser bias exists against manufactured housing, which results in lower value estimates. Another manufactured housing lender stated that most state-licensed or -certified appraisers have no training or experience in appraising manufactured homes.", 
                                "Commenters also cited concerns about the cost of requiring appraisals for these transactions. A national manufactured housing industry trade association and two manufactured housing lenders raised related concerns that appraisal costs would make these transactions less affordable for consumers and that an appraisal is expensive relative to the cost of a manufacture home. The national manufactured housing industry trade association expressed the view that these costs could result in reduced manufactured housing lending.", 
                                "The Agencies specifically requested comment on the potential burdens on creditors and consumers and any potential reduction in access to credit that might result from imposing requirement for an appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA with an interior property inspection on all creditors of loans secured by both a new manufactured home and land. Two national appraiser trade associations believed that concerns about appraisal costs could be mitigated because professional appraisers can provide a range of services other than an interior inspection but still in conformity with USPAP. These commenters argued that the cost of a professional appraisal is relatively small compared to the value provided to borrowers and to loan underwriting safety and soundness. A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization believed that the costs of an appraisal with an interior inspection would be no higher than the costs of appraisals for site-built homes subject to the rule.", 
                                "No commenters offered data on the cost of the method of using the manufacturer's invoice for the home and conducting a separate appraisal of the land. However, a national manufactured housing industry trade association asserted that this method costs consumers less than the type of appraisal that the HPML appraisal rules require. Informal outreach by the Agencies with a manufactured housing lender after the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule suggested that the interior inspection was the element of the HPML appraisal requirements that added the most cost. Another manufactured housing lender believed that the land-only appraisal would still be expensive for consumers. A national association of owners of manufactured homes, a consumer advocate group, a policy and research organization, and two affordable housing organizations stated that they did not have cost information in order to respond to the question posed by the Agencies.\n          ", 
                                "In addition, the Agencies requested comment on whether consumers currently receive information about the value of their land and manufactured home. A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a policy and research organization, and a national association of owners of manufactured homes asserted that consumers do not currently receive valuation information. Two manufactured housing lenders stated that, when appraisals are performed, lenders are required to provide the ECOA notice informing consumers that a copy of the appraisal may be obtained from the lender upon request.\n            One of the manufactured housing lenders indicated that it routinely issues a copy of the appraisal to its customers. The other lender stated that, after receiving the ECOA notice, very few consumers request the appraisal information.", 
                                "Finally, the Agencies requested comment on alternative methods that may be appropriate for valuing new manufactured homes and land, which the Agencies could require as a condition of an exemption from the general HPML appraisal rules in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3) through (c)(6). A real estate trade association, two national appraiser trade associations, a consumer advocate group, a policy and research organization, two affordable housing organizations, and a national association of owners of manufactured homes believed that a discussion of conditioning the exemption was unnecessary because they believed that there should be no exemption for these transactions.", 
                                "All other commenters on this issue\u2014a national mortgage banking association, a State credit union association, two nonbank manufactured home lenders, a State manufactured housing industry trade association, and a national manufactured housing industry trade association\u2014opposed adding conditions to the exemption. The manufactured housing lenders stated that they were unaware of a reliable, uniform valuation method by which to provide information to a consumer in new or existing manufactured housing transactions. The mortgage banking trade association believed that providing an alternative valuation would confuse consumers, and a State credit union trade association believed that a condition would increase the cost for consumers to obtain credit."

                                "The Agencies are adopting a modified exemption for transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land. Under the final rule, creditors for these transactions will be subject to all of the HPML appraisal requirements except for the requirement that the appraisal include a physical visit of the interior of the manufactured home. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(3)(i). As discussed below, the Agencies believe that this exemption from the requirement for a physical visit of the interior of the property is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. Comment 35(c)(2)(viii)(A)-1 clarifies that a creditor of a loan secured by a new manufactured home and land could comply with &#167; 1026.35(c)(3)(i) by obtaining an appraisal conducted by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser based on plans and specifications for the new manufactured home and an inspection of the land on which the property will be sited, as well as any other information necessary for the appraiser to complete the appraisal assignment in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA. Compliance with the HPML appraisal rules for these transactions is not mandatory until July 18, 2015.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies conducted additional research and outreach after issuing the January 2013 Final Rule to determine how to treat loans secured by existing manufactured homes under the HPML appraisal rules. In this process, the Agencies obtained information about manufactured home lending valuation practices that prompted the Agencies to review the exemption in the January 2013 Final Rule for transactions secured by a new manufactured home, whether or not the transaction is secured by land.", 
                                "Through research, written comments, and informal outreach, the Agencies obtained the views of a wider range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, affordable housing organizations, a policy and research organization, and a national association of owners of manufactured homes (summarized earlier \u201cPublic Comments\u201d).\n            In addition, the Agencies consulted with additional manufactured home lenders, one of which indicated that the lender obtains appraisals in conformity with USPAP for these transactions.\n            Based on this information, the Agencies understand that a pivotal factor in valuing manufactured homes is whether the transaction is secured by land. Accordingly, the Agencies are adopting a final rule that applies different rules to loans secured by a new manufactured home and land (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(A)) and loans secured by a new manufactured home without land (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)).", 
                                "The Agencies understand that manufactured home lenders regularly value a new manufactured home and land by relying on the manufacturer's (wholesale) invoice for the home unit (marked up by a certain percentage to account for siting costs, dealer profit, and related expenses associated with the transactions) and having a separate appraisal performed on the land. The two values are then added together to obtain a maximum loan amount, which may not be the amount of credit ultimately extended. The Agencies understand that transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land can be consummated before the new home is sited or, in some cases, even built.", 
                                "For these reasons, the Agencies recognize that applying the HPML appraisal rules to transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land will represent a change in practices for many manufactured home lenders. In part to mitigate unnecessary burden, the Agencies are exempting these transactions from the requirements that the appraisal include a physical inspection of the interior of the new manufactured home. In addition, the Agencies understand that an interior inspection of the property is a central obstacle to complying with the HPML appraisal rules in transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land, since production of the home might not be completed or started before the loan is consummated. Further, the Agencies believe that an interior inspection on a new manufactured home may not be warranted because the home would not have been subject to wear and tear and production and installation inspections new manufactured homes occur as part of a separate regulatory framework administered by HUD.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Under the final rule, as of July 18, 2015, a creditor could, for example, obtain an appraisal based on the appraiser's review of plans and specifications of the new home and an inspection of the site. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comment 35(c)(2)(viii)(A)-1. Neither USPAP nor FIRREA requires an interior inspection, but the Agencies believe that all other aspects of the HPML appraisal rules could and should be complied with. USPAP and FIRREA also do not require an appraiser to use particular types of comparables in valuing manufactured homes, so appraisers will have flexibility in selecting either manufactured home comparables or site-built comparables as the appraiser deems appropriate or as the creditor, secondary market participant, or relevant government agency requires. The Agencies are also aware that public comments and outreach included varying views on the availability of appropriate comparables and appraisers with the relevant competency to conduct USPAP land/home appraisals for transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land, with some generally asserting that appropriate comparables and competent appraisers are readily available, while other expressed concerns that at least in some markets they are not. However, the Agencies believe that giving creditors 18 months before compliance becomes mandatory can provide time for creditors and other stakeholders to determine how to address concerns in these areas.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that applying the HPML appraisal rules to transactions secured by new manufactured homes and land is important for several reasons. First, as with transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and land, covering transactions secured by a new home and land is consistent with the requirements of the GSEs and Federal government agencies for these types of loans. Again, Congress designated HPML transactions that are not qualified mortgages to be \u201chigher-risk\u201d than other transactions; therefore, the Agencies believe it prudent and in keeping with congressional concern to be consistent with other Federal standards for these loans.", 
                                "Second, appraiser representatives and regulators have made it clear in public comments on this rulemaking and independent publications that separate assessments of the unit value and land added together do not constitute an acceptable appraisal.\n            For loans deemed \u201chigher-risk\u201d by Congress, the Agencies have reservations about a valuation practice that diverges from practices deemed appropriate and most likely to result in a valid outcome.", 
                                "Third, all commenters on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule that did not represent the manufactured home lending industry, as well as a few manufactured home lenders, opposed a full exemption for loans secured by a new manufactured home and land. These comments strongly suggest that the exemption would not be in the public interest, as required by the statute. Commenters opposing a full exemption generally held the view that appraisals in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for these homes are feasible and that prudent lending practice and consumer protection are best served by obtaining appraisals for transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land together. They believed that appraisals with interior inspections would allow consumers to obtain better information about the value of their homes than methods that combine an appraised value of a site and a marked-up invoice price of a manufactured home. As noted under \u201cPublic Comments,\u201d some manufactured home lenders indicated that they already conduct appraisals in conformity with USPAP for transactions secured by a new manufactured home and land.", 
                                "The Agencies decline, however, to adopt suggestions from some of these commenters that the general appraisal requirements should cover a broader range of transactions. Regarding the suggestion that the general appraisal requirements should cover transactions secured by a manufactured home and a leasehold interest, the Agencies are aware that State laws may vary regarding rights attendant to leasehold interests and that different lease terms might have different values; both are factors that would be beyond the scope of the final rule to provide guidance. GSE and Federal agency manufactured housing programs require the securing property to be real estate; whether a manufactured home and lease-hold meets that standard varies by State law and the Agencies believe that uniformity across states for the HPML appraisal rules would best facilitate compliance. At the same time, the Agencies recognize that lease terms and stability of tenancy can affect value, and believe that these factors would be appropriate to take into account as part of valuations for appraising transactions secured by a home and not land. The final rule permits but does not require consideration of these factors.\n            See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">3</em>) and accompanying section-by-section analysis.", 
                                "The Agencies are also not following the suggestion that the appraisal requirement be applied to transactions secured by a home whenever the borrower owns the land, even if the transaction is not secured by the land. The Agencies are concerned that accounting for differing ownership structures of the land would complicate the rule and could be difficult for creditors and appraisers to assess. The Agencies also have questions about whether appraisals of the land and home together, even if the land is not securing the transaction, will consistently lead to the desired result\u2014market value of the collateral securing the loan. Some lenders indicated that when a loan goes into foreclosure, the property may be repossessed and taken back into dealer inventory; thus, it would seem important for a lender to know the value of the structure by itself. Again, the Agencies recognize that the location of the home can have a significant impact on its value, and believe that the location-related factors would be appropriate to take into account as part of valuations for transactions secured by a home and not land. The final rule permits but does not require consideration of these factors. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">3</em>) and accompanying section-by-section analysis.", 
                                "Fourth, most commenters, including leading manufactured housing lending industry representatives, expressed support for developing and even requiring appropriate valuations for manufactured home transactions. In light of additional stakeholder views received since issuance of the January 2013 Final Rule and additional research, the Agencies believe that applying the HPML appraisal rules to transactions secured by new manufactured homes and land, as well as transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and land, creates needed incentives for the continued training of state-certified and -licensed appraisers in valuing manufactured homes and the development of appraisal methods tailored to value collateral in manufactured home lending transactions, including appropriate use of comparables. This will in turn support improved accuracy and reliability of appraisals for these transactions.", 
                                "Regarding concerns expressed by commenters about a lack of comparable sales data, the Agencies understand that in many cases comparable sales data is reported to and available in Multiple Listing Services (MLS) regarding sales of manufactured homes and land classified as real property. The Agencies recognize that a more robust tracking of manufactured home sales information would be beneficial and may take time, and encourages efforts in this regard. The delayed effective date is intended to allow more time to move forward in this process.", 
                                "Finally, the Agencies believe that treating manufactured home loans secured by both the home and land in the same way as loans secured by site-built homes and land will foster the development of greater consistency between the rules and practices applicable to transactions secured by site-built homes and manufactured homes. The Agencies believe that this consistency of rules and practices will contribute to integrating manufactured home lending more fully into the broader mortgage market over time, which could have long-term benefits for consumers and lenders.", 
                                "For these reasons, on balance, the Agencies have concluded that an exemption from the HPML appraisal requirement for a physical visit of the interior of the home as part of the appraisal will promote the safety and soundness of creditors and be in the public interest."

                                "As noted, in the January 2013 Final Rule, the Agencies adopted an exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements for loans secured by a \u201cnew manufactured home.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 78 FR 10368, 10379-10380, 10433, 10438, 10444 (Feb. 13, 2013). The January 2013 Final Rule did not address loans secured by &#8220;existing&#8221; (used) manufactured homes, which therefore would be subject to the appraisal requirements unless the Agencies adopted an exemption.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, additional research and outreach on valuation practices for loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land indicated that current valuation practices for these transactions generally do not involve using a state-certified or -licensed appraiser to perform a real property appraisal in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA with an interior property inspection, as required under TILA section 129H and the January 2013 Final Rule. In addition, lender commenters on the 2012 Proposed Rule had raised concerns about the availability of data on comparable sales that may be used by appraisers for loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. They indicated that data from used manufactured home sales not involving land (usually titled as personal property) are not currently recorded in MLS of most states, so an appraiser's ability to obtain information on comparable manufactured homes without land is more limited than in real estate transactions. A provider of manufactured home valuation services confirmed in outreach with the Agencies in 2013 that manufactured home sales information is generally not available through standard real estate data sources.\n            The Agencies also understood that, in many states, appraisers are not currently required to be licensed or certified in order to perform personal property appraisals.", 
                                "Accordingly, the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule would have exempted transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land in proposed \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)(B).\n            The Agencies noted that an exemption would promote the public interest in affordable housing by ensuring transactions were not subject to a requirement not suited to this particular collateral type at this time, and would promote safety and soundness by allowing creditors to rely on currently prevalent valuation methods to ensure profitability and diversity to mitigate risk. The Agencies requested comment on this proposed exemption.", 
                                "In addition, however, the Agencies' 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule sought comment on any risks that could be created by an unconditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home, whether new <em data-original=\"E-03\">or</em> existing, and not land. After the January 2013 Final Rule was issued, consumer advocates and other stakeholders expressed concerns that some transactions in the lending channel for manufactured home-only (chattel) transactions (both of new and existing manufactured homes) can result in consumers owing more than the manufactured home is worth. For this type of loan, stakeholders such as consumer and affordable housing advocates asserted that networks of manufacturers, broker/dealers, and lenders are common, and that these parties can coordinate sales prices and loan terms to increase manufacturer, dealer, and lender profits, even where this leads to loan amounts that exceed the collateral value.", 
                                "Consumer advocates and others raised concerns that, where the original loan amount exceeds the collateral value and the consumer is unaware of this fact, the consumer is often unprepared for difficulties that can arise when seeking to refinance or sell the home at a later date. They also noted that chattel manufactured home loan transactions tend to have much higher rates than conventional mortgage loans. Some stakeholders suggested that giving the consumer third-party information about the unit value could be helpful in educating the consumer, particularly as to the risk that the loan amount might exceed the collateral value, and might prompt the consumer to ask important questions about the transaction.", 
                                "Accordingly, the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule posed a number of questions seeking comment on conditioning the exemptions for manufactured home-only transactions on providing the consumer with an estimate of the value of the manufactured home no later than three business days before consummation. The 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule discussed several types of estimates.", 
                                "First, based on input from lenders and manufactured home valuation providers, the Agencies understood that in new home-only transactions, many creditors determine the maximum amount that they will lend by using the manufacturer's invoice, or wholesale unit price, marked up by a certain percentage to reflect, for example, dealer profit and siting costs. As discussed in the 2012 Proposed Rule, informal outreach participants indicated that this practice\u2014similar to that sometimes used for automobiles\u2014is longstanding in new manufactured home transactions.\n            Lenders asserted that these methods save costs for consumers and creditors and has been found to be reasonably effective and accurate for purposes of ensuring a safe and sound loan.", 
                                "Second, outreach to manufactured home lenders indicated that in transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and not land, lenders typically obtain replacement cost estimates derived from nationally published cost services, taking into account factors such as the age of the unit (to derive depreciated values) and regional location of the home.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Third, the Agencies understood that additional methods exist for conducting personal property appraisals of manufactured homes. For example, HUD has adopted property valuation standards for HUD-insured loans secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. These standards call for use of a certified independent fee appraiser to conduct a valuation of the home using data on comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area.\n            \n          "

                                "A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization indicated that the Agencies should adopt a rule that would ensure that consumers have information about their home value before entering into an HPML secured by an existing manufactured loan without land.", 
                                "Providers of valuations and their trade associations also generally supported providing copies of valuation information to consumers in these transactions. Two appraiser trade associations stated that consumers have a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to understand the market value of the property collateralizing covered loans. A provider of a manufactured home cost guide stated that consumers unequivocally would benefit from knowing the cost estimate value of their home.", 
                                "Industry support for providing this information to consumers was more limited. A State credit union association stated that in an HPML secured by an existing manufactured home and not land, the consumer should receive a copy of a valuation, which this commenter believed would be a valuable tool for the consumer. A State manufactured housing trade association stated that, if a reliable repository of data on comparable sales were developed, it would support providing the consumer a copy of a valuation based upon such data.", 
                                "More broadly, manufactured home lending industry commenters questioned the need for valuation regulations on new manufactured home transactions on several grounds. A State manufactured housing trade association noted that most manufactured housing lenders are portfolio lenders who have incentives to adopt appropriate underwriting standards and not to over-finance the loan. This commenter asserted that the widespread practice of using actual cost information from the manufacturer's invoice to determine maximum loan amount prevents over-financing. Finally, the commenter stated that over-financing has not been substantiated as a problem in manufactured home lending. Thus, the commenter suggested that the Agencies take more time to study the issue of manufactured home valuations before proposing a final rule in this area.", 
                                "Similarly, a national community banking trade association stated that a portfolio lender's assumption of credit risk is an incentive to choose appropriate valuation methods. Further, two State credit union associations stated that existing valuation methods suffice for ensuring reasonably safe and sound loans. Another State credit union association noted that creditors have alternatives to the USPAP interior-inspection appraisal, such as an exterior inspection or drive-by, or an analysis of sales of comparable homes.", 
                                "One manufactured home lender suggested that consumers purchasing manufactured homes do not need appraisals because manufactured homes are sold like automobiles, in that they are sold from a retailer's display center. Therefore, the commenter suggests that instead of providing consumers with appraisals, consumers should be encouraged to engage independently in comparative shopping when selecting a home as well as when shopping for a loan. Another manufactured home lender stated that consumers do not need information beyond the sales contract, which breaks down certain costs. This commenter stated that information about the value of the home is not relevant to these consumers because they do not buy manufactured homes for investment. A manufactured home lender also stated that it does not offer loans based on the collateral value but instead on the consumer's ability to repay.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing trade association stated that inspections by HUD-certified inspectors conducted on all new manufactured homes provide lenders and consumers a strong guarantee of the quality of a manufactured home.\n            Moreover, this commenter asserted that the HUD inspection process, coupled with the verification that lenders receive from manufactured home retailers and builders on all new manufactured homes,\n            dispenses with the need for an appraisal and interior inspection.", 
                                "Two national appraiser associations generally asserted that the importance of valuation information to the consumer and lenders far outweighs the costs and burdens of providing this information. However, one manufactured home lender suggested that the cost of performing third-party appraisals would be unnecessary for the consumer, especially given this commenter's concerns about their reliability in home-only transactions. In addition, the commenter suggested that these costs would be a particular hardship on consumers who purchase manufactured home because they tend to have lower incomes and lower credit scores than consumers of site-built homes; thus, they are purchasing a manufactured home because it is the most affordable and viable option available to them to own their own home. Finally, the commenter suggested the burden on manufactured home creditors of valuation requirements is likely to result in a reduction in lending. Similarly, a national manufactured housing trade association commenter suggested that existing valuation methods are adequate and cost consumers substantially less than traditional property appraisals.", 
                                "A manufactured home lender expressed concerns in particular about requiring creditors to provide a third-party cost service unit value to the consumer for either new or existing manufactured homes. According to this commenter, the technology and personnel required to program and develop a system to compare the home's year, manufacturer, and model name with the appropriate year, manufacturer, and model name from a specific price guide would be considerable. Further, this commenter asserted, this type of requirement would add to all lenders' overhead costs, which would increase the cost of credit (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> be passed on to the consumer). This lender predicted that such a task would deter other established creditors, including banks and credit unions, from offering financing secured by a manufactured home.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Location.</em> A question with equal applicability to transactions secured by either a new or existing manufactured home was a request for comment on the impact the location of a new manufactured home can have on its value and whether cost services are available that account adequately for differences in location. Commenters who responded generally agreed that the location of a manufactured home can have a significant impact on its value. Two national appraiser association commenters suggested that the location of a manufactured home can have a significant influence on its value and that they know of no cost services that adequately account for price differences in locations.", 
                                "A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national manufactured homeowner association, and a policy and research organization suggested that manufactured homes are very rarely moved because moving a manufactured home is expensive and likely to damage the unit. As a result, a location-based value is more relevant to resale value. These commenters further suggested that attributes of the home's location that affect the home's value are tangible and visible, but that there are other attributes of a manufactured home's location that affect the home's value that are not typically captured in existing valuation models. Examples of such characteristics provided were lease terms or State laws that: (1) Stabilize rent; (2) ensure that the home may remain where it is sited; (3) ensure that the homeowner is able to sell the home to a new owner without having to move it; and (4) protect the lender's interest in the home if the homeowner defaults on the loan.", 
                                "One manufactured home lender suggested that similar factors, such as proximity to retail shopping, the quality of the neighborhood public and private schools, the condition and upkeep of neighboring properties, and other factors that affect the value of site-built homes will also affect the value of manufactured homes. However, the commenter suggested that due to historical biases against manufactured homes in urban areas and most neighborhoods\u2014expressed through zoning restrictions, prohibitions, and restrictive covenants\u2014most manufactured homes are located in rural communities. A manufactured home lender also indicated that, in fact, it is not uncommon for manufactured homes may be moved from a sited location back to a dealer's lot, particularly when they have been foreclosed upon and are in rural areas.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Further study.</em> Several commenters suggested that more time may be needed to develop reliable alternatives to a USPAP- and FIRREA-compliant appraisal based upon a physical inspection of the interior of the home. Two manufactured housing lenders, while generally opposed to conditioning the exemption, suggested the Agencies that postpone any decision on these issues for several months of further evaluation. A State manufactured housing trade association indicated that it would only support a condition if a mandatory repository of data on comparable sales were developed and sufficient time passed for this repository to populate.\n\n            This commenter also expressed concerns that very few, if any, loans secured by manufactured homes would be exempt from the HPML appraisal rules as qualified mortgages. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(i). This commenter suggested that the large number of loans potentially covered by conditions on any exemption for manufactured home transactions that would involve alternative valuations warranted further study of these options by the Agencies.", 
                                "Similarly, a consumer advocate group, two affordable housing groups, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization, while generally supporting conditions, suggested that the Agencies convene a working group of stakeholders to review and develop valuation standards. These commenters observed that this approach would help to integrate the manufactured housing sector into the larger housing market. In their view, valuation rules would create demand, which would improve capacity for providing valuations and also generate more financing options for manufactured home consumers."

                                "The Agencies solicited comment on whether it would be appropriate and beneficial to consumers to condition the exemption from the HPML appraisal requirements on the creditor providing the consumer with various types of third-party information about the manufactured home's cost, which third-party estimates should be used for these estimates, and when creditors should be required to provide the information. The Agencies received several comments on these questions. Representatives of appraisal providers, a credit union, a community bank, a consumer advocacy group, three affordable housing groups, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and one policy and research organization generally suggested that consumers would benefit. On the other hand, a manufactured home lender, two manufactured housing trade associations, a State credit union association, a mortgage company, a national community bank trade association, and a national mortgage banking trade association generally suggested that consumers would not benefit and a condition should not be adopted.",

They asserted that a consumer who is given the invoice is better able to evaluate the accuracy of the description of the home's features. Given concerns about truth and accuracy in invoices in capturing all dealer payments, though, these commenters suggested that these transactions ultimately should be subject to the HPML appraisal rules on the same basis as site-built homes. In their view, higher valuation standards would improve appraiser capacity and, they argued, decrease incentives to steer consumers to loans with weaker standards.", 
                                "Regarding the credibility of manufacturer's invoices, the Agencies received conflicting information. One affordable housing organization differentiated between a dealer's invoice and a manufacturer's invoice, indicating that incentives and rebates might be omitted from the dealer's invoice but not from the manufacturer's invoice so the manufacturer's invoice would be more reliable for the consumer. A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization, however, commented that the manufacturer's invoice may not have accurate information about the actual cost paid by the dealer because it might not reflect incentives, rebates, and in-kind services agreed upon by the dealer and manufacturer. However, as noted, they believed that the representation of home features on the invoice would be useful to consumers.", 
                                "A national manufactured housing trade association stated that the manufacturer certifies to the retailer the authenticity and accuracy of the wholesale cost of the manufactured home at the point of manufacture. A manufactured housing lender further suggested that the manufacturer's invoice is the only realistic option upon which to base a home's value because it takes into account the upgrades and other features pertinent to the home. This commenter suggested that the invoice amount also offers a \u201cconservative\u201d figure in terms of valuation and loan-to-value considerations. However, the commenter noted that a consumer's total sales price will include certain other third-party charges related to the move and set-up of the manufactured home, dealer mark-ups and occasionally local government fees required to be paid by the dealer.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Third-party cost service estimates.</em> Regarding the utility of providing a third-party unit estimate from an independent cost service, a credit union commenter stated that a third-party unit estimate would give consumers a valuable guideline to prevent predatory practices. Similarly, a community bank commenter stated that this information could help alleviate the potential for dealer price markups over manufacturer's suggested retail price. A national provider of a manufactured home cost service stated in its comment letter that its cost guide information could &#8220;absolutely&#8221; be useful to consumers, but cautioned that providing consumers with multiple different indications of value could make the process more confusing to consumers. The provider further stated that its cost guide can be used to provide a &#8220;guideline&#8221; that is a &#8220;reasonable approximation&#8221; for a new manufactured home value using the &#8220;new or like new&#8221; condition for the current-year model. The cost guide provider indicated that its value estimates consider the home's manufacturer, model, size, year, and region. In its cost guide, adjustments are also possible for State location, the general condition of the home, as well as for value added by additional features.",

One manufactured home lender asserted that cost guides consider pieces of property in the abstract and fail to account for the cost of permits, site preparation, and delivering the home to the purchaser's site. Moreover, this commenter suggested cost guides are typically used by lenders only to determine a value for pre-owned manufactured homes.

However, two national appraiser association commenters stated that they strongly support requiring an independent third-party valuation by a credentialed third party appraiser with education, training, and experience, or a valuation through the National Appraisal System (NAS), which would be consistent with the requirements of government programs.\n            \n          ",

Several commenters responded to this and a related question; all generally suggested that, other than the retail purchase and sale agreement between the manufactured home purchaser and the retailer, no third-party information is currently provided to consumers about the value of their new manufactured home. One manufactured home lender noted that the retail purchase agreement will list the retail price of the manufactured home and itemize and include in the total cost all other costs and charges associated with the transactions and installation of the home and extras. Another manufactured home lender added that it is not the industry custom to disclose the wholesale amount to a consumer. Rather, the commenter suggested, the Agencies should not require disclosures of cost information for consumers and deviate from widely accepted practice in other areas of retail sales, including automobiles or site-built homes.",

Two national appraiser associations asserted that, under the statute, consumers have a fundamental right to know the value of the home that collateralizes debt they incur. However, a provider of a manufactured home cost guide suggested that consumers could access manufactured home value information on its Web site representing the depreciated replacement cost of a home.",

A consumer advocacy group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization suggested that a copy of the manufacturer's invoice should be provided to consumers after the execution of the buyer's order but prior to the consummation of the transaction. Finally, one community bank suggested that third-party cost guide information should be provided to the consumer at least three days prior to consummation because the data is readily available through the database."

A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization stated, however, that any appraiser capacity issues are driven by a lack of valuation standards for the manufactured housing segment. As a result, allowing the rule to take effect after a temporary period would lead to demand for appraisers, creating an incentive for appraisers to obtain the requisite skills.",

A manufactured home lender stated that sales of existing manufactured homes on leased land are not reported to MLS and that data on comparable sales outside of California is generally lacking. The commenter noted, though, that one private company does aggregate comparable sales data from different sources around the country, which is usually used for transactions in land-lease communities. The national manufactured housing trade association added that state-certified or -licensed appraisers do not capture data on sales of existing manufactured homes, whether from retail dealers or communities. In addition, this commenter suggested that data may be distorted by foreclosures in rural areas leading to relocation of homes to dealer inventory.

A national community bank trade association and a State credit union association generally believed that that a USPAP-complaint appraisal with an interior inspection would be costly for low-income borrowers purchasing existing manufactured homes. Another State credit union association and a national credit union association supported the exemption because manufactured home values are generally lower than the values of other types of home.

One manufactured home lender stated that it uses the guide to calculate a &#8220;theoretical&#8221; value, which is imperfect given the lack of reliable information about the condition of the home. Another nonbank lender stated that while it uses this guide to determine approximate wholesale value on trade-ins and as a general guide to the potential sale price for repossessions, it does not use the guide in transactions to finance the purchase or refinance of an existing manufactured home and not land.\n            A consumer advocate group, two affordable housing organizations, a national association of owners of manufactured homes, and a policy and research organization further confirmed the widespread use of third-party cost service depreciation schedules in this segment of the market.", 
                                "Regarding the accuracy of third-party cost service estimates for existing manufactured homes, a national provider of a manufactured home cost guide stated that its values are derived by applying depreciation factors to the cost estimate of the home, and are designed to represent \u201cretail worth\u201d assuming average condition and certain components. Adjustments can be made for actual condition, inventoried components, and local site value (for homes located in land-lease communities).\n\n            The commenter stated that the local site value adjustment is representative of a national average of the contributing value for land-lease communities with certain attributes. After accounting for this adjustment, the value can be up to 33 percent higher or 11 percent lower than the value of the structure only (on average, the location adjustment adds 13 percent). While acknowledging that only appraisers are qualified to analyze a property's sited location, this commenter claimed that its location adjustment was more cost effective than an appraisal based upon a physical inspection, without sacrificing accuracy. When it compared its location-adjusted values with estimates from a sample of over 1,000 personal property appraisals of manufactured homes over a wide range of ages, it found that the median difference between its estimates and the appraised value was less than five percent.",

These commenters also noted that the cost guide assumes the property value has depreciated and that available adjustments based upon the property condition are not required; as a result, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades could be left out of the value and the property could be under-valued. Further, these commenters expressed concern that widespread use of a depreciated value could drive rather than reflect manufactured home values.

A manufactured home lender noted that HUD-approved valuation methods based upon comparable sales tend to yield values below the sales price, which this commenter attributed to an over-emphasis on use of manufactured homes as comparables.\n            Another manufactured home lender claimed that this occurrence in HUD-approved appraisals is evidence that they undervalue manufactured homes.

                                "The Agencies believe that the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B) for loans secured by manufactured homes and not land promotes the safety and soundness of creditors in part because the exemption makes it possible for creditors to continue making these loans, which may be an important part of a given creditor's operations; the Agencies understand that for chattel transactions, compliance with all of the general HPML appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3) through (6) may be infeasible. The condition on the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B) is necessary to ensure that the exemption is also in the public interest, because the condition will ensure that consumers receive information pertaining to the value of their manufactured home. The Agencies further believe that by allowing creditors a menu of options for compliance, the condition will provide appropriate flexibility to the creditor to select which materials it deems most cost-effective. The Agencies also believe that having this information before consummation of the loan can be useful to the consumer, and is consistent with the timing of the general HPML appraisal requirement that the creditor must give the consumer a copy of the appraisal three days before consummation.\n            \n            <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(6)(ii).", 
                                "TILA Section 129H ensures that, before consummation of a \u201chigher-risk mortgage,\u201d creditors obtain a valuation of the home and provide a copy to the consumer. 15 U.S.C. 1639h. The statute focuses on transactions with a higher risk profile (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> those with higher interest rates and which are not qualified mortgages). For these riskier transactions, the statute sets standards that are intended to reduce the risk of inflated valuations of the &#8220;dwelling,&#8221; and grants consumers a right to know the appraised value of the &#8220;dwelling&#8221; before entering into these transactions.\n            A manufactured home is a &#8220;dwelling&#8221; under regulations implementing TILA.\n            Indeed, transactions secured by manufactured homes and not land comprise a substantial proportion of the overall annual housing transactions that are HPMLs and not qualified mortgages.\n            The Agencies therefore believe that Congress intended for TILA Section 129H to provide protection against inflated valuations and transparency to borrowers in this housing segment.", 
                                "Nonetheless, based upon outreach and comments on the 2012 Proposed Rule and further outreach and comments on the 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule, the Agencies believe that the precise form of valuation specified in the statute\u2014an appraisal by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA, based upon a physical inspection of the interior of the home\u2014is infeasible for this housing segment at this time. A steady supply of state-certified or -licensed appraisers to service thousands of these transactions annually starting on January 18, 2014, does not yet exist.", 
                                "Even if more state-certified or -licensed appraisers were able to perform appraisals for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land in the future, the Agencies recognize that sources of data on comparable sales for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land may not be as robust as sources of data on sales of transactions secured by a home and land.\n            As a result, the Agencies believe that, absent an exemption, creditors could be unable to comply with the HPML appraisal requirements in a substantial number of transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. Thus, the Agencies have concluded that an exemption from a requirement to perform appraisals in conformity with USPAP and FIRREA for these transactions would promote the safety and soundness of creditors and be in the public interest by allowing the transactions to occur without requiring use of a valuation method that is infeasible in a large number of cases.", 
                                "At the same time, the risk of inflated valuations in these transactions can contribute to increased default risk,\n            which runs counter to both the safety and soundness of creditors and the public interest. The Agencies are concerned, based on research, outreach, and comments received, that these transactions can be prone to inflated valuations and associated risks of under-collateralization, leading to loans where the consumer has little, no, or even negative equity in the home.\n            The Agencies believe that an unconditional exemption for these transactions at a minimum would not adequately account for the risks of under-collateralization.", 
                                "The effect of an inflated valuation on consumers and their risk of default can be even more pronounced in these transactions. Chattel lending generally carries higher interest rates, which could result in a significant number of HOEPA loans.\n\n            Further, several industry commenters indicated that manufactured home loans would be less likely to be qualified mortgages than other types of mortgages because their points and fees would typically exceed thresholds set by the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e)(3). At the same time, consumers borrowing these loans are disproportionately in the LMI segment.\n            Higher loan amounts resulting from inflated valuations, combined with the comparatively high interest rates on these loans, can generate payments that pose significant burdens on LMI consumers and can put them at greater risk of default.", 
                                "Outreach and comments from the 2012 Proposed Rule and 2013 Supplemental Proposed Rule have not shown that existing industry practices or standards necessarily would be sufficient to control the risk of inflated valuations in these transactions, or ensure that consumers are informed of the home value in these transactions. To compound the concern, most of these transactions are not subject to valuation standards imposed by Federal law or regulation or Federal agency or GSE programs. The FHA Title I Manufactured Housing Loan Insurance Program is the only program at the Federal level that covers these transactions; no other Federal agency or GSE has programs for loans secured by a manufactured home and not land. The FHA Title I program includes valuation requirements and loan amount caps to mitigate against the risk of inflated valuations, but currently most transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land are not insured by that program. Some of these transactions are originated by Federally regulated financial institutions subject to FIRREA's appraisal and evaluation requirements, but the FIRREA regulations and related Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines apply only to real estate transactions.\n            Under current State laws, the collateral in transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land is not typically classified as real property.", 
                                "In addition, all creditors are subject to Regulation Z's interim final valuation independence rule (Valuation Independence Rule) for consumer credit secured by chattel, but the valuation service providers are not, due to a limitation in the current rule.\n            The Valuation Independence Rule applies to creditors and \u201csettlement service\u201d providers of covered transactions.\n            Under the rule, \u201csettlement service\u201d is defined under RESPA and implementing regulations (Regulation X).\n            Under RESPA and Regulation X, a \u201csettlement service\u201d is limited to services for \u201cFederally related mortgage loans,\u201d which include only loans secured by real property.\n            Thus, valuation service providers for transactions secured by personal property, such as many transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land, are not covered under Regulation Z's Valuation Independence Rule.", 
                                "Further, commenters indicated that consumers in transactions secured by manufactured homes and not land do not currently receive information about the value of their homes. Participants in informal outreach and research conducted by the Agencies similarly indicated that consumers for these loans are not familiar with independent information about home values and may be subject to high-pressure sales tactics that tend to limit consumer's consideration of their choices and pursuit of independent information.", 
                                "Finally, while consumers might receive valuations in some of these transactions under the Bureau's 2013 ECOA Valuations Final Rule,\n\n            creditors might not always obtain a valuation subject to disclosure to the consumer under that rule. For example, in new manufactured home transactions without land, outreach and comments indicated that creditors often rely primarily upon the manufacturer's invoice when determining the maximum loan amount. The manufacturer's invoice is not subject to disclosure under the 2013 ECOA Valuations Final Rule.\n            In addition, the maximum loan amount is not necessarily a valuation subject to disclosure under ECOA, and could well exceed caps defined under HUD regulations that serve to prevent over-financing, under-collateralization, and underwater loans.\n            Accordingly, even if that amount were disclosed to consumers under the 2013 ECOA Valuations Rule, it would not necessarily impart meaningful, independent information to the consumer about the value of the home.", 
                                "The Agencies therefore are adopting a condition on the exemption to ensure that valuation information from an independent source is obtained and is transparent to the consumer. The condition requires the creditor to obtain and provide to the consumer, no later than three days before consummation, certain information related to the value of the manufactured home securing the covered HPML.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Agencies have identified three types of materials, any one of which can be provided, as further discussed below.",

                                "Outreach and comments consistently indicated that in these transactions, creditors use the invoice as the primary source for calculating a maximum loan amount. For that reason, several commenters generally supported providing a copy of the invoice to consumers as a means of informing them of pertinent valuation information. A national manufactured housing trade association also asserted that it is standard practice for manufacturers to certify the authenticity and accuracy of the wholesale cost of the home at the point of manufacture.", 
                                "The Agencies are adopting a limitation on the option to provide the manufacturer's invoice: the invoice may be provided to satisfy the condition only if the date of manufacture of the home was within 18 months of the creditor's receipt of the consumer's application for credit. This limitation is generally consistent with FHA Title I regulations, which incorporate the practice of using manufacturers' invoices as a reference point for determining safe and sound loan amounts for insuring transactions secured by new manufactured homes. Specifically, FHA Title I rules limit the use of this practice to homes manufactured within 18 months of purchase by the consumer.\n            The Agencies believe that this limitation will help prevent the use of invoices that are too dated to reflect reliably the current value of the manufactured home.", 
                                "Creditors commonly obtain and rely on the manufacturer's invoice and consumer advocates, affordable housing organizations, and others, however, have asserted that consumers should have access to information that creditors use. If creditors have the invoice, providing a consumer with a copy imposes little burden.", 
                                "The Agencies note that some commenters were concerned that the manufacturer's invoice contains sensitive wholesale pricing information and that the wholesale invoice from the manufacturer will not match the retail price paid by the consumer. The Agencies recognize that the retail price will include a markup for various costs. Commenters and industry participants in outreach indicated that in transactions secured by new manufactured homes, the maximum loan amount typically is determined by applying a percentage markup to the manufacturer's invoice. Outreach indicated that this markup can vary among creditors, in some cases significantly. The Agencies are not aware of any regulatory standards governing the extent of this markup other than limitations in the FHA Title I program, which only covers a small subset of these loans currently. The FHA Title I limitations do not permit a markup on the manufacturer's invoice of more than 130 percent when calculating the maximum insurable loan amount, and HUD has other detailed standards for determining what other charges can be factored into the maximum loan amount.\n            Most manufactured housing transactions are not subject to these restrictions, leaving the markup to be determined by the creditor's tolerance for risk, and thus subject to risk of inflated valuation.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that providing the manufacturer's invoice to consumers will give them an opportunity to have a better understanding of the factors contributing to the loan amount and its relationship to the value of the home.\n            In transactions secured by a home and land under GSE and Federal agency programs, the appraiser is required to receive a copy of this invoice and must disclose in the appraisal report how it was considered.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Under the final rule, creditors also may choose to communicate the nature or extent of this markup to consumers when providing the manufacturer's invoice. In this case, the manufacturer's invoice will provide an opportunity for questions from consumers to assess whether the markup leads the collateral to be over-valued. As noted above, HUD-certified counselors, required for HOEPA transactions and available for others, also can assist consumers in answering any questions. The Agencies have sought to accommodate remaining concerns over providing the manufacturer's invoice by providing other compliance options that could be used in new manufactured home transactions (including that the loan might qualify for another exemption under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)).\n            \n          ",

Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>)-1 clarifies that a cost service provider from which the creditor obtains a manufactured home unit cost estimate under &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) is independent if that party is not affiliated with the creditor in the transaction, such as by common corporate ownership, and receives no direct or indirect financial benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.", 
                                "As noted above, the Agencies recognize that creditors may choose not to provide a copy of the manufacturer's invoice for new manufactured home transactions. In addition, appraisers or valuation providers may be unavailable for some transactions. Thus, including this additional option is important to ensure that the consumer can receive a unit cost estimate of the value of the home from an independent source. Commenters and outreach indicated that this type of estimate is the predominant method used for transactions secured by an existing manufactured home and not land. Based upon comments from a national cost service provider confirming that its cost guide reports values for the current model year, the Agencies also believe this type of cost service also could be used for many new manufactured home transactions. The Agencies learned from one cost service that an adjustment for \u201cnew or like new\u201d is available through its cost guide, and that this guide is updated multiple times per year.", 
                                "The information provided by an independent cost service provider can provide a useful outside check against inflated valuations. At the same time, the check will not prohibit transactions above the value reflected in the cost service. Rather, the check will make sure that if transactions occur above those values, creditors and consumers have the opportunity to know that fact and evaluate the transaction accordingly.", 
                                "Interior inspections and adjustments. The Agencies are not requiring physical inspections of the interior or condition or location adjustments to the cost service values. In this way, the condition ensures that the creditor can readily identify the information to be provided to the consumer (based upon the make and model and year of the manufactured home unit) from an independent source, without being asked to interject subjective or discretionary considerations.", 
                                "Interior inspections by an appraiser for new manufactured homes may often be of limited value, given the associated expense. For transactions secured by new manufactured homes, as indicated by industry commenters, HUD and State inspectors conduct inspections to ensure the proper construction and installation of the home.\n            Some commenters asserted that an interior inspection could confirm the existence of extras or options that were promised. The Agencies believe, however, that consumers themselves can confirm that they received extras or options ordered. Regarding adjustments, the Agencies understand that cost services may offer adjustments of standard estimates to reflect that the unit is in \u201cnew or like new\u201d condition.", 
                                "For existing manufactured homes, information about the condition of the interior can be an important factor affecting the valuation. Due to concerns with burden, complexity, and reliability of such adjustments, though, the Agencies are not mandating that adjustments be made. At the same time, the rule does not prohibit creditors from making this adjustment to the unit-cost estimate of an existing manufactured home.", 
                                "Accordingly, comment 35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>)-2 clarifies that the requirement that the cost estimate be from an independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to factors such as special features, condition or location. The comment explains, however, that the requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost service used, with associated values that are determined by the independent cost service.", 
                                "For both new and existing manufactured homes, the location can enhance or, in some cases, reduce the value of the home. A consumer advocate group, affordable housing organizations, and others emphasized that cost service data does not adequately account for the contribution of location to the value of the home. The manufactured home can be resold as a trade-in or repossessed, however, in which case its value-in-place is not what is relevant to the consumer. Further, as noted above, location adjustments can introduce greater subjectivity into the information provided. Therefore, the rule does not mandate that a location adjustment be made. Providing the unit value will enable consumers to compare the cost estimate from the published cost service to the line item charge in the sales contract for the base unit.", 
                                "Finally, some commenters expressed concerns over accuracy or undervaluation in the unit cost estimates published by third-party cost services. These commenters did not provide data to support their views, however. In addition, while some comments noted that the unit cost estimate is not the same as an estimate of the retail market value, the Agencies recognize that this type of estimate nonetheless is widely used by creditors currently as a guideline for the value of an existing manufactured home. In some cases, it therefore may represent the best available, most cost-effective estimate of the value of the home. Further, the Agencies are structuring the exemption condition so that the creditor has the discretion to choose which of the specified types of valuation materials it finds most suitable for informing the consumer of the estimated value of the home. Thus, if a creditor believes an independent cost service generally undervalues manufactured homes, the creditor can provide other forms of valuation information as described below, as well as its own accompanying explanatory information.",

Specifically, the comment states that a valuation in compliance with &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">3</em>) would include, for example, an appraisal of the manufactured home in accordance with the appraisal requirements for a manufactured home classified as personal property under the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Insurance Program of HUD (administered by FHA), pursuant to section 2(b)(10) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1703(b)(10).", 
                                "The Agencies included this comment in recognition that one of the more well-developed standards for the valuation of manufactured homes and not land is found in the FHA Title I program.\n            When an existing manufactured home is classified as personal property, FHA Title I requires creditors to, among other things: (1) Use an appraiser certified to use the NAS or, if the lender is unable to locate an NAS-certified appraiser, an appraiser from the FHA Title II mortgage program who certifies having experience appraising manufactured homes;\n            (2) obtain an appraisal performed on the home site where possible and that reflects the retail value of comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area; and (3) review the appraisal to verify, among other things, that the correct cost service unit value was used and proper condition adjustment was made.\n            \n          ",

                                "Consumer and affordable housing advocate commenters supported the long-term goal of applying an appraisal standard to transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. At the same time, manufacturer housing industry commenters generally supported a long-term effort to further refine and develop valuation methods for manufactured homes. The Agencies believe that adopting a condition that furthers these goals is in the public interest. To allow flexibility for these and other valuation methods to evolve, the Agencies seek to avoid prescriptive, detailed requirements on the valuation method. Rather, the Agencies seek generally to define who is eligible to perform the valuation, and leave the method to that person's judgment and expertise as appropriate for the scope of work required. As noted above, two national appraisal trade associations noted that state-certified or -licensed appraisers are not the only persons who could value manufactured homes. For example, some commenters identified an existing product prepared by a company who hires individuals trained in the valuation of manufactured homes. The company generates a report that estimates the value of a given manufactured home using local data on comparable sales.", 
                                "Accordingly, under this alternative, the creditor must provide the consumer with a valuation prepared by one or more individuals who do not have a direct or indirect financial interest in the property or the transaction, and who have training in the valuation of manufactured homes. The Agencies are adopting comments to provide further guidance on how creditors can satisfy these criteria. Finally, it may follow from the exercise of independent judgment and application of this training that the individual will conduct a physical inspection of the interior, or assess the condition or value of the location of the home. But as noted, at this time, the Agencies are not specifying these steps as necessary elements of a valuation that satisfies the condition.", 
                                "Several industry commenters indicated that HUD appraisal requirements in transactions secured by manufactured homes have led to higher frequency of appraisals where the value of the home is below the purchase price. At least one commenter indicated this occurred in Title I transactions secured by existing manufactured homes. Some commenters and outreach participants attributed high numbers of appraised values that are lower than the purchase price to an over-emphasis on the use of manufactured homes as comparables in FHA and other manufactured home credit programs. They suggested, for example, that manufactured homes comparables in the geographic area might be much older than the home being appraised. The Agencies are concerned, however, that other factors can contribute to higher rates of appraised values lower than the purchase price, such as inflated purchase prices and corresponding loan amounts.", 
                                "The Agencies believe that, on balance, appraising manufactured homes in transactions that are not also secured by land can be an effective way to account for the many factors that contribute to the value of the home, including home condition, location, re-sale conditions, and lease terms, among others.\n          "

Industry commenters raised a number of concerns over the utility to consumers of information generated through current valuation practices, however. Several consumer and affordable housing groups expressed a similar concern over the quality of current valuation methods (citing, for example, concerns over the reliability of a cost estimate of the unit from a third-party source). They nonetheless stated that creditors should still be required to provide a copy of the collateral valuation information that is used by the creditor (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> manufacturer's invoice in new manufactured home transactions). These commenters also suggested that the Agencies engage in further study of manufactured housing valuation issues before adopting further conditions.", 
                                "The Agencies note, however, that manufactured housing valuation practices and issues have been the subject of significant requests for comment and outreach in two separate proposals, and have generated detailed comment from representatives of industry, consumer advocates, and appraisers alike. The Agencies believe that the current public record sufficiently supports adopting conditions in this final rule. While the Agencies are allowing additional 18 months for conditions to be implemented, deferring their adoption pending further study would not promote safety and soundness and be in the public interest. Thousands of consumers would be without the protections during any further study. It also is unclear that further study, beyond the two years of study already undertaken, would generate material improvements to the approach taken here.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Steering.</em> Some consumer group and affordable housing commenters also expressed concern that consumers might be steered into higher-rate chattel transactions with fewer consumer protections if the final rule provided an unconditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. For example, consumers could be steered away from an HPML transaction secured by both the home and land to avoid the HPML appraisal requirements (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)(viii), effective July 18, 2015). Creditors might also structure what otherwise would be a packaged land/home transactions into two transactions&#8212;one secured solely by the home and one by land. The Agencies believe that some of these concerns are mitigated by other laws and regulations. Such practices might be subject to scrutiny under consumer protection laws at the State and Federal level. For example, regulations may apply that generally prohibit a loan originator from steering a consumer to a transaction based on the fact that the originator will receive greater compensation (which could result from an over-valuation of the home, leading to a higher loan amount).\n            The Agencies believe that some of the concerns about steering may be mitigated by conditioning the exemption for manufactured home-only transactions on the creditor having to provide alternative valuation information to the consumer.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Effective date.</em> The Agencies recognize creditors will need time to make necessary adjustments to their compliance systems to be able to comply with the condition. For example, creditors will need to adjust their systems to identify transactions that would need to rely on the exemption (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> HPMLs that are not eligible for exemptions for loans that satisfy the criteria of a qualified mortgage, transactions in an amount of $25,000 or less, or other exemption types (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.35(c)(2)),\n            to determine which types of valuation materials to obtain for these transactions, and to develop a mechanism for providing these to the consumer no later than three days prior to consummation. Creditors also will need to ensure that they have access to the valuation materials they choose to use. To ensure adequate time to implement these and any other necessary steps, and that these transactions remain available to consumers in the interim period, the Agencies are delaying implementation of the condition for 18 months after the effective date of the HPML Appraisals Rules, until July 18, 2015.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Sunset.</em> Finally, the Agencies are not adopting an expiration date for the conditional exemption for transactions secured by a manufactured home and not land. Some commenters suggested that a &#8220;sunset&#8221; date would provide an incentive for the appraiser and manufactured home lending industries to improve capacity and methods for conducting appraisals that would comply with USPAP and FIRREA. However, it is unclear that a sunset date would promote this outcome. At the same time, a sunset date would create risk for this important source of affordable housing if capacity and methods are not developed by that date. The Agencies believe that a better way to promote improved capacity and methods is to allow the condition to be satisfied through the use of existing methods. This is therefore another reason why the Agencies are allowing the third option for satisfying the condition&#8212;appraisals performed by independent and trained individuals."

The Agencies are not adding a waiver option to the timing requirement for providing a copy of the appraisal to the consumer. Re-numbered comment 35(c)(6)(ii)-2 clarifies that the ECOA provision allowing a consumer to waive the requirement that the appraisal copy be provided three business days before consummation, does not apply to HPMLs subject to \u00a7 1026.35(c).\n            The comment further clarifies that a consumer of an HPML subject to \u00a7 1026.35(c) may not waive the timing requirement to receive a copy of the appraisal under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(6)(i).",

ECOA expressly provides that the consumer may waive the three day timing requirement for the creditor to provide a copy of the appraisal to the consumer under ECOA.\n\n            By contrast, Congress did not amend TILA to include a parallel waiver provision regarding the same requirement in the context of appraisals for HPMLs. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 129H(c), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(c). The Agencies interpret TILA's lack of a waiver provision to indicate that Congress did not intend to allow consumers of loans covered by the HPML appraisal rules to waive the timing requirement."
