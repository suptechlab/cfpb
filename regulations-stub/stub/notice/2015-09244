    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is reissuing a prior interpretive rule regarding the provision of lists of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies to mortgage loan applicants with additional interpretations describing permissible addresses for list generation, as well as additional details for generation. This interpretive rule also provides guidance, in addition to existing commentary, on the qualifications for providing high-cost mortgage counseling and on lender participation in such counseling. This interpretive rule continues to describe data instructions for lenders to use in complying with the requirement under the High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA Homeownership Counseling Amendments) Final Rule to provide a homeownership counseling list using data made available by the Bureau or Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).",
