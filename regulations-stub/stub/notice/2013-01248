    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is amending Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, and implementing a commentary that sets forth an official interpretation to the regulation. The final rule implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mortgage loan servicing. Specifically, this final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act sections addressing servicers' obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; to provide certain information requested by such borrowers; and to provide protections to such borrowers in connection with force-placed insurance. Additionally, this final rule addresses servicers' obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures to achieve certain delineated objectives; to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; to establish policies and procedures for providing delinquent borrowers with continuity of contact with servicer personnel capable of performing certain functions; and to evaluate borrowers' applications for available loss mitigation options. Further, this final rule modifies and streamlines certain existing servicing-related provisions of Regulation X. For instance, this final rule revises provisions relating to mortgage servicers' obligation to provide disclosures to borrowers in connection with transfers of mortgage servicing, and mortgage servicers' obligation to manage escrow accounts, including restrictions on purchasing force-placed insurance for certain borrowers with escrow accounts and requirements to return amounts in an escrow account to a borrower upon payment in full of a mortgage loan. Concurrently with the issuance of this final rule, the Bureau is issuing a rule implementing amendments relating to mortgage servicing to the Truth in Lending Act in Regulation Z.",

For example, a borrower may submit a letter that claims to be a \u201cNotice of Error\u201d that indicates that the borrower wants to receive the information set forth in an annual escrow account statement and asserts an error for the servicer's failure to provide the borrower an annual escrow statement. Such a letter may constitute an information request under \u00a7 1024.36(a) that triggers an obligation by the servicer to provide an annual escrow statement. A servicer should not rely on the borrower's characterization of the letter as a \u201cNotice of Error,\u201d but must evaluate whether the letter fulfills the substantive requirements of a notice of error, information request, or both."

Although investors or guarantors, including among others the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association, may be exposed to risks related to the mortgage loans held by a trust either in connection with an investment in securities issued by the trust or the issuance of a guaranty agreement to the trust, such investors or guarantors are not the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans solely as a result of their roles as such. In certain circumstances, however, a party such as a guarantor may assume multiple roles for a securitization transaction. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association may act as trustee, master servicer, and guarantor in connection with a securitization transaction in which a trust owns a mortgage loan subject to a request. In this example, because the Federal National Mortgage Association is the trustee of the trust that owns the mortgage loan, a servicer complies with \u00a7 1024.36(d) by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by providing the name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association as the trustee. The following examples identify the owner or assignee for different forms of mortgage loan ownership:"

If a securitization transaction is structured such that a trust is the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan and the trust is administered by an appointed trustee, a servicer complies with \u00a7 1024.36(d) by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by providing the borrower with the name of the trust and the name, address, and appropriate contract information for the trustee. Assume, for example, a mortgage loan is owned by Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, for which XYZ Trust Company is the trustee. The servicer complies with \u00a7 1024.36(d) by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by identifying the owner as Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, and providing the name, address, and appropriate contact information for XYZ Trust Company as the trustee."

If a trial or permanent loan modification option is denied because of a requirement of an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the requirement that is the basis of the denial. A statement that the denial of a loan modification option is based on an investor requirement, without additional information specifically identifying the relevant investor or guarantor and the specific applicable requirement, is insufficient. However, where an owner or assignee has established an evaluation criteria that sets an order ranking for evaluation of loan modification options (commonly known as a waterfall) and a borrower has qualified for a particular loan modification option in the ranking established by the owner or assignee, it is sufficient for the servicer to inform the borrower, with respect to other loan modification options ranked below any such option offered to a borrower, that the investor's requirements include the use of such a ranking and that an offer of a loan modification option necessarily results in a denial for any other loan modification options below the option for which the borrower is eligible in the ranking."

Mortgage broker transactions that are table-funded are not secondary market transactions. Neither the creation of a dealer loan or dealer consumer credit contract, nor the first assignment of such loan or contract to a lender, is a secondary market transaction (see \u00a7 1024.2)."

The MSR represents the present value of all the cash flows, both positive and negative, related to servicing a mortgage. Prime MSRs are largely created by the GSE minimum servicing fee rate, which is calculated as 25 basis points (bps) per annum. The servicing fee rate is typically paid to the servicer monthly and the monthly amount owed is calculated by multiplying the pro rata portion of the servicing fee rate by the stated principal balance of the mortgage loan at the payment due date. Accounting rules require that a capitalized asset be created if the \u201ccompensation\u201d for servicing (including float/ancillary) exceeds \u201cadequate compensation.\u201d For loans held in portfolio, there is no bifurcation of the interest income from the loan. The owner of the loan simply negotiates pricing, terms, and standards with the servicer, which, at larger institutions, is typically a separate affiliate or subsidiary of the owner of the loans.

                "The Bureau proposed to delete the text of current \u00a7 1024.3 concerning the process for the public to submit questions or suggestions regarding RESPA or to receive copies of Public Guidance Documents and to replaced it with the substance of the regulation concerning electronic disclosures set forth in current \u00a7 1024.23. The Bureau did not believe a provision of Regulation X was needed to address the process for submitting questions and requesting documents. The public may contact the Bureau to request documents, suggest changes to Regulation X, or submit questions, including questions concerning the interpretation of RESPA by mail to the Associate Director, Research, Markets, and Regulations, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G St. NW., Washington, DC 20552, or by email to <em data-original=\"E-03\">CFPB_RESPAInquiries@cfpb.gov</em>.

Because the Bureau believes that such E-Sign Act provisions are applicable to all provisions in Regulation X, it decided that the best place for the language was in \u00a7 1024.3. In the process of moving the language in current \u00a7 1024.23 to \u00a7 1024.3, the Bureau also made technical edits to conform the language to the language of other similar Bureau regulations. The Bureau did not receive comments on these revisions to current \u00a7\u00a7 1024.3 and 1024.23. The Final rule adopts \u00a7 1024.3 as proposed and removes \u00a7 1024.23 as proposed.", 
                "Current \u00a7 1024.4 sets forth provisions relating to reliance upon rules, regulations, or interpretations by the Bureau. The Bureau proposed to remove current \u00a7 1024.4(b) and redesignate current \u00a7 1024.4(c) as proposed \u00a7 1024.4(b). Current \u00a7 1024.4(b) provides that the Bureau may, in its discretion, provide unofficial staff interpretations but that such interpretations do not provide protection under section 19(b) of RESPA and that staff will not ordinarily provide such interpretations on matters adequately covered by Regulation X, official interpretations, or commentaries. The Bureau's policy is to assist the public in understanding the Bureau's regulations, including, but not limited to, Regulation X. The Bureau believes that this provision, which states Bureau policy, is more appropriate for the commentary and, accordingly, proposed to include the substance of this provision in the introduction to the commentary. The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed removal of current \u00a7 1024.4(b) and re-designation of current \u00a7 1024.4(c) as proposed \u00a7 1024.4(b). The final rule adopts these revisions as proposed.",

The Bureau did not receive comments on this technical correction, and the final rule adopts the technical correction to \u00a7 1024.5 as proposed, with an additional technical change to clarify the applicability of subpart C to <em data-original=\"E-03\">bona fide</em> transfers in the secondary market.",

                        "Section 6(g) of RESPA establishes that if the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require a borrower to make payments to a servicer of the loan for deposit into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect to the property, the servicer shall make such payments from the borrower's escrow account in a timely manner as such payments become due. Existing \u00a7 1024.21(g) provides that the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.17(k) govern the payment of such charges. Existing \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1) provides that if the terms of a federally related mortgage loan require a borrower to make payments to an escrow account, a servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner (specifically, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty) unless a borrower's payment is more than 30 days overdue. Existing \u00a7 1024.17(k)(2) requires servicers to advance funds if necessary to make the disbursements in a timely manner unless the borrower's mortgage payment is more than 30 days past due. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, a servicer may seek repayment from a borrower for the deficiency pursuant to \u00a7 1024.17(f).", 
                        "The Bureau proposed a new \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) to expand the scope of these obligations with regard to continuing a borrower's hazard insurance policy. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) would have required that, notwithstanding \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1) and (2), a servicer must make payments from a borrower's escrow account in a timely manner to pay the premium charge on a borrower's hazard insurance, as defined in \u00a7 1024.31, unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Thus, proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) would have required a servicer to both advance funds to an escrow account and to disburse such funds to pay a borrower's hazard insurance notwithstanding that a borrower is more than 30 days delinquent.", 
                        "The proposed requirement would not have applied where a servicer had \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that such insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges\u201d because the Bureau recognized that there were situations where timely payment by a servicer would not be sufficient to continue a policy that had already been canceled or was not renewed for other reasons, such as, for example, risks presented by the condition of the property.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed commentary to clarify the requirements in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). Specifically, the Bureau proposed to clarify in comment 17(k)(5)-1 that the receipt by a servicer of a notice of cancellation or non-renewal from the borrower's insurance company before the insurance premium is due provides a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Comment 17(k)(5)-2 would have provided three examples of situations in which a borrower's hazard insurance was canceled or not renewed for reasons other than the nonpayment of premium charges, including because the borrower cancelled the insurance policy, because the insurance company no longer writes the type of policy that the borrower carried or writes policies in the area where the borrower's property is located, or because the insurance company is no longer willing to maintain the borrower's individual policy to cover the borrower's property because of a change in risk affecting the borrower's property. Finally, proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3 would have clarified that a servicer that advances the premium payment as required by \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) may advance the payment on a month-to-month basis, if permitted by State or other applicable law and accepted by the borrower's hazard insurance company.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) to protect consumers from the unwarranted force-placement of hazard insurance. Force-placed insurance generally provides substantially less coverage for a borrower's property at a substantially higher premium cost than a borrower-obtained hazard insurance policy, as discussed below in connection with \u00a7 1024.37. Section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act demonstrates that Congress was concerned about the unwarranted or unnecessary force-placement of hazard insurance for mortgage borrowers. Section 6(k) of RESPA, as amended by section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act, evinces Congress's intent to establish reasonable protections for borrowers to avoid unwarranted force-placed insurance coverage. Section 1024.17(k)(5), though articulated differently than the protections directly set forth in section 1463, draws directly from Congress's intent as set forth in section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect borrowers from the force-placement of hazard insurance in situations where such force-placement is unwarranted and can be avoided. When a servicer is receiving bills for the borrower's hazard insurance in connection with administration of an escrow account, a servicer who elects not to advance to a delinquent borrower's escrow account to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance, allowing that insurance to lapse, and then advances a far greater amount to a borrower's escrow account to obtain a force-placed insurance policy unreasonably harms a borrower. Section 1024.17(k)(5) implements the purposes of section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect borrowers from the unwarranted force-placement of insurance when a servicer does not have a reasonable basis to impose the charge on a borrower.", 
                        "Further, considered as a whole, one of the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, is a requirement that servicers must have a reasonable basis for undertaking actions that may harm borrowers, including delinquent borrowers. Section 1024.17(k)(5) furthers this purpose by establishing that servicers may not unnecessarily obtain force-placed insurance in situations where such placement is not warranted, that is, when a servicer is able to maintain a borrower's current hazard insurance in force by advancing and disbursing funds to pay the premiums.", 
                        "The Bureau further reasoned that proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) would not increase burdens on servicers generally, because the Bureau understood that many servicers already advance hazard insurance premiums for borrowers with escrow accounts even if the borrowers' mortgage payments are more than 30 days past due. The Bureau also understands that the proposed requirement would benefit owners or assignees of mortgage loans by preventing the placement of costly and unnecessary force-placed insurance policies, the higher costs for which may be recovered from an owner or assignee in the event the property is liquidated.", 
                        "The Bureau sought comment on all aspects of the proposed escrow advance provision including on whether there should be additional limitations on a servicer's duty to advance funds. For instance, the Bureau sought comments on an alternative approach under which a servicer could not charge a borrower who has an escrow account established to pay hazard insurance for force-placed insurance unless those charges would be less expensive than the charges for reimbursing the servicer for advancing funds to continue the borrower's hazard insurance policy. The Bureau further requested comment regarding whether to require further that any such force-placed insurance policy protect the borrower's interest. In addition, the Bureau observed in the proposal that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) would only apply when a borrower has an escrow account established to pay hazard insurance, and also invited comments on whether a servicer should be required to pay the hazard insurance premiums on behalf of a borrower who has not established an escrow account to pay for such insurance. Finally, the Bureau further requested comment on whether a servicer should be required to ask such a borrower whether the borrower would consent to the servicer renewing the borrower's hazard insurance and, with the borrower's consent, be required to advance funds to pay such premiums.", 
                        "Industry commenters and their trade associations varied significantly in their comments with respect to \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). A number of commenters, including a force-placed insurance provider and two trade associations, stated that the proposed requirement was consistent with current industry practice and would not be onerous to implement. For example, one non-bank servicer indicated that it generally advanced funds to escrow and disbursed those funds to maintain hazard insurance so long as it viewed the advances as recoverable, notwithstanding the delinquency status of the borrower.", 
                        "Numerous other servicers and their trade associations, however, objected to the requirement that a servicer timely disburse funds from escrow to pay hazard insurance for borrowers who are delinquent and further that servicers should advance funds to escrow accounts that would then be disbursed to pay hazard insurance. Some industry commenters indicated that force-placed insurance is the appropriate means for insuring a property for a borrower that has not paid for hazard insurance. For example, a national trade association representing property and casualty insurers stated that the inclusion of limitations on force-placed insurance in section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act recognized that an appropriate role exists for force-placed insurance. Some commenters indicated that the procedures for obtaining force-placed insurance, specifically notices provided to borrowers, spur borrower action to communicate with servicers and to obtain insurance. These commenters believe that the threat of forced placement of insurance causes borrowers to obtain hazard insurance to avoid force-placed insurance. If the threat is effective, they argue, servicers should not have to advance funds to escrow accounts for delinquent borrowers. One commenter, a force-placed insurance provider, urged the Bureau to first evaluate the effectiveness of the notices and procedures required by the Dodd-Frank Act before adopting a final rule requiring a servicer to advance funds for borrowers whose mortgage payments were more than 30 days overdue. Finally, one commenter hypothesized that the proposed requirement was intended as a step toward potential future actions by the Bureau to eliminate the force-placed insurance product market.", 
                        "Some servicers and their trade associations questioned the Bureau's authority to require servicers to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. These commenters stated that (1) the Bureau does not have the authority to impose the requirement because it is not specifically set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, (2) section 6(g) of RESPA only applies to insurance required pursuant to the terms of a federally related mortgage loan, whereas the duty to advance funds appeared to apply even for insurance not required by the terms of the loan, and (3) the requirement was an unnecessary exercise of the Bureau's authority to impose additional obligations on servicers pursuant to sections 6(k)(1)(E) and 19(a) of RESPA. Commenters further objected that the requirement to advance funds would require a servicer to provide funds to maintain coverage obtained by a borrower that exceeded the coverage required by the lender, including, for example, coverage for borrower possessions or coverage beyond hazards the lender required to be covered.", 
                        "Some servicers and their trade associations further stated that the requirement to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance would have adverse consequences for servicers, borrowers, and the insurance market. With respect to potential impact on servicers, some commenters indicated that the proposed requirement would create a disincentive to establish escrow accounts. These commenters also indicated that borrowers may incorrectly presume that servicers will advance to escrow accounts for delinquent borrowers to pay all escrow obligations, not just hazard insurance. Further, a credit union trade association commented that requiring disbursements for hazard insurance may deplete funds that may be available to pay other escrow obligations, such as tax liabilities. A commenter stated that a servicer may be responsible for a loss if a hazard insurance provider to whom it has advanced payments denies coverage because a property is vacant and is excluded from coverage; in such a situation, the commenter said that force-placed insurance is necessary because it would cover the loss.", 
                        "Some servicers stated that borrowers may be unjustly enriched at the expense of their servicers by cancelling hazard insurance and obtaining for themselves refunds of premiums that were paid by their servicers. Although the Bureau had attempted to address this concern, which also was raised during the Small Business Review Panel, through proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3, servicers disagreed on the solution. Importantly, one state banking association stated that the risk of moral hazard and unjust enrichment was mitigated by proposed comment 17(k)(5)-3, which permitted the servicer to advance and disburse on a month-to-month basis, while another small bank commenter stated that the Bureau's comment permitting advancing on a month-to-month basis would increase its servicing costs because it would be paying a borrower's insurance twelve times per year.", 
                        "With respect to potential impact on borrowers, several commenters suggested that the proposal would result in an increase in incidents of a borrower being double-billed for hazard insurance. These commenters incorrectly interpreted the proposal to require a servicer to pay to maintain coverage even though the borrower had decided to cancel the insurance and pay a new insurer directly. These commenters stated that borrowers may be harmed because borrowers would be responsible for duplicative hazard insurance costs, whereas a borrower would be entitled to a refund for overlapping force-placed insurance, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.", 
                        "With respect to impacts on the insurance market, a number of commenters who are not insurance providers asserted that insurance providers generally view seriously delinquent borrowers as higher insurance risks compared to other borrowers. These commenters expressed concern that the Bureau's proposal could potentially mask this risk because the servicer would be required to advance premiums, even if a borrower is seriously delinquent. One commenter requested that the Bureau state that servicers may inform an insurance provider that a borrower is delinquent. In that regard, a commenter urged the Bureau to provide a form that servicers may provide to insurance providers stating that a lender is paying some identified portion of a borrower's insurance premium due to a deficiency in the borrower's escrow account.", 
                        "Small banks and credit unions, as well as their trade associations and other small non-bank servicers, indicated that the impact of proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) would be particularly acute for small servicers. These commenters indicated that small servicers typically have different practices with regard to force-placed insurance than large servicers. Outreach with small servicers indicated that in certain circumstances, such servicers may not require borrowers to maintain insurance coverage, may self-insure, or may impose charges for collateral protection plans that may be less costly than advances to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance coverage. Further, commenters asserted that small servicers may be more significantly impacted by the cost of the funds required to be advanced to borrower escrow accounts.", 
                        "Certain commenters requested clarification regarding whether a servicer would be entitled to recoup any required advances and whether a servicer may be liable to a borrower for failing to advance funds to, and disburse from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. Further, commenters requested clarification that advancing funds is only required if the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan requires the borrower to maintain hazard insurance.", 
                        "Finally, one credit union commenter requested that the Bureau exempt servicers of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) from the proposed requirement in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) to advance funds. The commenter asserted that HELOCs are largely in the subordinate-lien position and requiring a servicer of HELOCs to advance would generally be needless costly to such servicers because servicers servicing liens in the first position would also be advancing payment.", 
                        "The Bureau received numerous comments from consumers and consumer advocacy groups with respect to proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). These commenters strongly supported all aspects of proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) as set forth in the proposal. These commenters generally stated, however that the Bureau should go farther than the proposal and implement requirements regarding advances and disbursements to maintain hazard insurance for delinquent borrowers that do not have escrow accounts.", 
                        "Commenters significantly disagreed regarding the merits of requiring advances and disbursements to maintain hazard insurance of borrowers without escrow accounts. A number of consumer advocacy group commenters contended that the Bureau should make no distinction between homeowners that have escrow accounts and those that do not. Certain state attorney general commenters suggested instead that the Bureau should require a servicer, prior to force-placing insurance, to ask for a borrower's consent to renew voluntary coverage and to advance funds for the premium if the borrower gives consent to the creation of an escrow account. Industry commenters were nearly uniformly opposed to requiring servicers to advance funds for the hazard insurance premiums of borrowers who have not escrowed for hazard insurance, citing most often the impracticality for servicers to reinstate a lapsed policy without any gap in coverage.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) as proposed with adjustments to address pertinent issues raised by the comments. Specifically, the Bureau is not requiring that a servicer advance funds to, or disburse funds from, an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance in all circumstances. Rather, the Bureau had adjusted the requirement in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(i) to provide that a servicer may not obtain force-placed insurance unless a servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance is paid in a timely manner. Thus, for example, a servicer of a mortgage loan, including a HELOC, is not required to disburse funds from an escrow account to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance, so long as the servicer does not purchase force-placed insurance.", 
                        "Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(A), a servicer is unable to disburse funds if the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled or not renewed for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges. Further, \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(B) states that a servicer is not considered unable to disburse funds solely because an escrow account contains insufficient funds. Section 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(C) makes clear that a servicer may seek repayment from a borrower for funds advanced to pay hazard insurance premiums. Finally, the Bureau has determined to exempt small servicers, that is, servicers that service less than 5,000 mortgage loans and only service mortgage loans owned or originated by the servicer or an affiliate so long as any force-placed insurance purchased by the small servicer is less costly to a borrower than the amount that would be required to be disbursed to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1024.17(k)(5)(iii). The Bureau is not implementing any requirement that a servicer advance funds to pay for a hazard insurance policy for a borrower that does not have an escrow account.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that a servicer should not obtain force-placed insurance when a servicer is able to make disbursements from an escrow account to maintain hazard insurance. As set forth above, unless a policy has been cancelled for reasons other than nonpayment, a borrower's delinquency should not cause a servicer to take actions (or make omissions) that would lead to the cancellation of the borrower's voluntary insurance policy and the potential replacement of that policy with a more expensive (and less protective) force-placed insurance policy. The Bureau acknowledges that in certain circumstances, force-placed insurance is necessary. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not prevent a servicer from obtaining force-placed insurance, subject to the requirements in \u00a7 1024.37, when such a policy is appropriate, including, for instance, where a borrower's hazard insurance policy has been cancelled for reasons other than non-payment. In that situation, a servicer may impose a charge on a borrower for a force-placed insurance policy consistent with the requirements in \u00a7 1024.37. However, as set forth above and in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe imposition of a charge for force-placed insurance is appropriate where a hazard insurance policy has not been cancelled and a servicer is able to disburse funds from an escrow account to maintain the borrower's preferred hazard insurance policy in force.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau is therefore adopting \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) in reliance on section 6(k)(1)(E) of RESPA, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations that are appropriate to carry out the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. The Bureau has additional authority pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of RESPA to establish any requirements necessary to carry out section 6 of REPSA, including section 6(g) with respect to administration of escrow accounts, and has authority pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA to prescribe such rules and regulations, and to make such interpretations, as may be necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. The Bureau also has authority to establish consumer protection regulations pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act. A consumer protection purpose of RESPA is to help borrowers avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, and further, the amendments to section 6(k) of RESPA in section 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act evince Congress's intent to establish reasonable protections for borrowers to avoid unwarranted force-placed insurance coverage. Section 1024.17(k)(5) furthers these purposes and is therefore an appropriate regulation under section 6(j) and 6(k)(1)(E) and section 19(a) of RESPA.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau does not believe that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse consequences on servicers, borrowers, or the insurance market. With respect to impacts on servicers, \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) does not create significant disincentives to maintain escrow accounts for borrowers. Escrow accounts encourage borrowers to budget for costs of homeownership and to provide funds regularly to servicers to be used to pay those costs, including for insurance, taxes, and other obligations. Lenders include escrow requirements in mortgage contracts because the use of such an account reduces risk to an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Servicer also generally benefit from an escrow account both as a result of the improved performance of mortgage loans and also because of the opportunity to earn a return on funds held. Further, servicers manage the impact of an obligation to make advances to escrow accounts by ensuring that advances may be recouped from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan in the event a property is foreclosed upon and liquidated. In the absence of \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5), a servicer that obtains force-placed insurance might advance a greater amount of funds for the force-placed insurance policy and would seek to obtain repayment of those funds either from a borrower or ultimately from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan if a property is foreclosed upon and liquidated. For these reasons, the Bureau is not persuaded that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) creates an incentive that would materially affect whether servicers offer escrow accounts to borrowers.", 
                        "With respect to the ability of servicers to use funds in an escrow account to pay obligations other than hazard insurance, the Bureau recognizes, of course, that escrow account funds are fungible and that payment of hazard insurance necessarily requires expending funds that would have been available for payment of other escrowed obligations, including tax obligations. Servicers, on behalf of owners or assignees of mortgage loans, currently manage this risk by advancing funds to escrow accounts to pay such obligations and seeking repayment from borrowers or ultimately from proceeds payable to the owners or assignees of mortgage loans. No contrary practice is required here. Further, such a practice does not create any new or enhanced risk for servicers. Further, the Bureau has clarified in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(C) that servicers may seek repayment of advances unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. Servicers, as well as owners and assignees of mortgage loans, are capable of managing risks arising from other escrow account obligations by advancing funds to pay any such obligations as appropriate.", 
                        "The Bureau also does not believe that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) presents a material risk to servicers from borrowers cancelling policies, receiving refunds, and, thus, becoming unjustly enriched at the expense of a servicer. A borrower that is current on a mortgage loan obligation but anticipates a future delinquency could engage in the same type of behavior during a period of an escrow account deficiency. Commenters have not demonstrated that such actions typically occur. Further, the Bureau has mitigated this risk by finalizing comment 17(k)(5)(ii)(C)-1, which provides that servicers may, but are not required to, advance payment on a month-to-month basis. Because such advancement is not required on a month-to-month basis, servicers may determine not to undertake that schedule for advances if it would impose greater costs on servicers with respect to maintaining a borrower's hazard insurance.", 
                        "The Bureau is not persuaded that requiring servicers to disburse funds for hazard insurance for borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue will create incentives for borrowers not to make mortgage loan payments or to fund escrow accounts. Nothing in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5), nor Regulation X generally, prevents servicers from charging borrowers late fees or reporting borrower failures to pay to a consumer reporting agency. These consequences to borrowers provide appropriate disincentives from obtaining the far more limited benefit of non-cancellation of a hazard insurance policy.", 
                        "The Bureau is persuaded, however, by the comment that hazard insurance coverage may not provide similar protections as force-placed insurance. Many hazard insurance policies contain exclusions from coverage for properties that are vacant. In these circumstances, losses may not be covered by insurance for vacant properties. Delinquent borrowers may have a higher incidence of abandoning properties as vacant. Accordingly, the Bureau has adjusted \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(ii) to provide that a servicer may be considered unable to disburse funds from escrow to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance policy if the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe the borrower's property is vacant.", 
                        "The Bureau does not believe that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse impacts on borrowers. The only borrower harm asserted by servicers and their trade associations is that the requirement will lead to an increase in double-billing when a borrower cancels hazard insurance and obtains a new policy for which the borrower pays the insurer directly. The commenters provide no reason to believe that borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue are more likely to cancel hazard insurance and pay insurance directly than borrowers that are current on a mortgage loan obligation or less than 30 days overdue. Further, if a servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower has cancelled a hazard insurance policy, a servicer is not required to disburse funds to pay for the hazard insurance policy. Finally, when a borrower has cancelled a policy, an insurance company is unlikely to credit the amounts paid by a servicer toward that policy after the date of cancellation.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Further, the Bureau does not believe that \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) will have adverse impacts on the insurance market. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not, as commenters state, mask any risks presented by a borrower that is more than 30 days overdue on a mortgage loan obligation. Nothing in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) prevents a servicer from reporting a borrower's payment history to a consumer reporting agency, and an insurance provider could, to the extent permitted by applicable law, obtaining borrower information it deems relevant to underwriting insurance, including a consumer report. In addition, if insurers are harmed by insuring borrowers who are delinquent on their mortgage loans, they face that same harm already for borrowers that do not have escrow accounts and pay hazard insurance premiums directly to their insurers. Section 1024.17(k)(5) does not present a different category of risk in that regard. With respect to one commenter's request that the Bureau issue a form for lenders and servicers to provide to insurance providers stating that a servicer is paying some identified portion of a borrower's insurance premium due to a deficiency in the borrower's escrow account, the Bureau declines. To the extent applicable law permits a lender or servicer to communicate such information to an insurance provider, the lender or servicer should not need the Bureau to develop a form for the communication.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau believes that special treatment is warranted with respect to \u201csmall servicers\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4). As explained in the section by section discussion of \u00a7 1024.30(b) and in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule, the Bureau has identified a class of servicers, referred to as \u201csmall servicers\u201d and defined by the combination of the number of loans they service and the servicer's relationship to those loans that sets those servicers apart. With respect to the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5), outreach with small servicers indicates that small servicers' practices with respect to obtaining force-placed insurance tend to be less costly to borrowers than those utilized by larger servicers. For example, the Bureau understands that small servicers often obtain force-placed insurance in the form of collateral protection policies. The charges passed through to borrowers for such coverage, if any, may be less expensive than the costs of either maintaining a borrower's hazard insurance coverage or purchasing an individual force-placed insurance policy. At the same time, requiring such servicers to continue the borrower's hazard insurance in force, which may require advancing funds to the borrower's escrow, could cause these servicers to incur incremental expenses which, because of their size, would be burdensome for them. Because of this difference in practices, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to reduce the restrictions applicable to small servicers with respect to borrowers that have escrow accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau has exempted small servicers from the restriction in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(i) and 1024.17(k)(5)(ii)(B), so long any force-placed insurance that is purchased by the small servicer is less costly to a borrower than the amount that would be required to be disbursed to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage. The Bureau believes this partial exemption sets an appropriate balance of effectuating consumer protections for borrowers with escrow accounts and considerations that may be unique to small servicers.", 
                        "After consideration of the comments received, the Bureau has also determined not to require servicers to continue hazard insurance policies and advance premium payments for borrowers who have not escrowed for hazard insurance. The Bureau understands the concern of the consumer groups that commented, but the Bureau is persuaded that it would generally be impracticable for servicers to renew the hazard insurance coverage obtained by a non-escrowed borrower without creating a significant risk of double-billing and/or a gap in coverage. For example, although the Bureau does not find concerns about double-billing of borrowers persuasive with respect to situations in which insurance coverage is being paid via disbursement from an escrow account, the Bureau is concerned that a substantially different situation results where the borrower is making direct payments and a policy is allowed to lapse due to non-payment. In those cases, it is far more likely that a consumer may have switched insurance providers without notifying the servicer, and requiring a servicer to obtain a new policy (or to reinstate a previously cancelled policy) may result in borrower harm through the purchase of duplicative insurance and double-billing of a borrower. Further, when a borrower does not have an escrow account, the servicer may not have notice before a policy lapses, and no ability to maintain the policy in continuous force. Were the Bureau to impose a duty on the servicer to pay for hazard insurance in such circumstance, such a duty would not necessarily be to maintain a current policy in force. Rather, the duty could well be to reinstate a lapsed policy or to obtain a new policy on behalf of the borrower to replace the cancelled policy. Requiring a servicer to obtain a new insurance policy on behalf of a borrower that did not have an escrow account to pay for hazard insurance may be burdensome and complex, and may not be justified. Accordingly, the Bureau declines at this time to impose requirements to obtain insurance for borrowers that do not have escrow accounts but will continue to monitor the impact of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.37 with respect to force-placed insurance for any such borrowers.", 
                        "Two consumer groups submitted joint comments urging the Bureau to amend current \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1) so that a servicer would be required to make timely disbursements with respect to any escrowed charge, not just hazard insurance, so long as the borrower's escrow account contained sufficient funds to do so. These consumer groups asserted that there is no reason to maintain the limitation for disbursements to borrowers that are less than 30 days overdue with respect to escrow obligations other than hazard insurance. For example, the commenters stated that the failure of a servicer to pay tax obligations in a timely manner would harm a borrower, and suggested that finalizing \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) in isolation could cause borrower confusion because borrowers may not understand that the rule applies only to hazard insurance.", 
                        "The Bureau understands the commenters' concern with respect to the impact on borrowers if an escrowed charge is not paid, but declines to amend \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1) as part of this rulemaking. Section 1024.17(k)(5), as adopted, is only a restriction on servicers' ability to obtain force-placed insurance. If a servicer will not be purchasing force-placed insurance, the servicer is not subject to the provisions of \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). For example, a servicer that does not require a borrower to maintain insurance is not required to disburse funds to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance coverage other than as required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1). Because the Bureau is not imposing a blanket obligation to advance funds to escrow to pay hazard insurance premiums, the Bureau does not believe that it would be appropriate to impose such an obligation with respect to other payments to be made from escrow. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to amend \u00a7 1024.17(k)(1) as suggested.", 
                        "Finally, as discussed above, the Bureau requested comments on an alternative approach to \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5), which would have added language to \u00a7 1024.37 to provide that if a borrower has an escrow account established for hazard insurance, a servicer could not charge the borrower for force-placed insurance unless the force-placed insurance obtained by a servicer was less expensive to the borrower, for comparable coverage, than would be the servicer's advancing funds to continue the borrower's hazard insurance policy. The Bureau further requested comments on whether \u00a7 1024.37 should additionally require that force-placed insurance purchased by a servicer under these circumstances protect a borrower's interests.", 
                        "One large force-placed insurance provider asserted that the proposed alternative is neither necessary or realistic because proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5) reflects general industry practice and because the cost of force-placed insurance is invariably more expensive to the borrower than the servicer advancing funds to continue a borrower's hazard insurance policy. On the other hand, another large force-placed insurance provider and a national trade association expressed a preference for the alternative compared to proposed \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). These commenters preferred, however, that the alternative be placed in \u00a7 1024.17(k), and not in \u00a7 1024.37, because they believed that this alternative should only limit a servicer's force-placement of insurance in situations where an escrowed borrower's hazard insurance was canceled due to a servicer's failure to disburse funds to maintain a borrower's hazard insurance. Commenters further expressed a variety of views concerning how the scope of comparable coverage would be determined. While industry commenters acknowledged that the industry standard is to obtain force-placed coverage equal to the replacement cost of the property, two national trade associations and a large force-placed insurance provider argued that servicers must be given flexibility to determine coverage levels. In contrast, another large force-placed insurance provider suggested that the Bureau should require coverage at replacement cost value.", 
                        "After consideration of the comments received on the alternative, the Bureau believes that the alternative proposal's requirement regarding comparable coverage would add unnecessary complexity to the regulation. Whether a borrower may or may not benefit from any particular coverage level is dependent on the individual circumstances of the borrower. Further, differences between coverage provided for homeowners' insurance and force-placed insurance make a comparability determination and complex and difficult process. The Bureau declines to adopt the alternative proposal with respect to obtaining comparable coverage.", 
                        "Section 1024.17(k)(5), as adopted, however, is informed by the alternative and the comments received in response to the alternative. The Bureau has adjusted the requirement in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5), consistent with the alternative, to reflect that a servicer's ability to disburse funds to maintain hazard insurance coverage serves as a restriction on the servicer's purchasing force-placed insurance coverage. Thus, a servicer is not required in all instances to disburse funds to maintain hazard insurance coverage for borrowers that are more than 30 days overdue; instead, a servicer may not obtain force-placed insurance coverage unless the servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account pursuant to \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). Further, the exemption for small servicers in \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5)(iii) provides that a small servicer may obtain force-placed insurance, even if the small servicer is not unable to disburse funds from a borrower's escrow account, so long as the cost to the borrower is less than the amount the small servicer would need to disburse to maintain the borrower's hazard insurance, without consideration of the specific policy coverage provisions."

The Bureau requested comment in the 2012 TILA Servicing Proposal regarding that exemption and, in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, further requested comment regarding whether the Bureau should implement a small servicer exemption for any mortgage servicing requirements proposed in Regulation X.", 
                        "The Bureau received three comment letters from consumer advocacy groups with respect to a small servicer exemption from certain requirements in Regulation X. One comment from three consumer advocacy groups indicated that small servicers should be exempt from the loss mitigation procedures requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 on the basis that these servicers already have an interest in mitigating any losses that might result from proceeding with foreclosure. Two other consumer advocacy groups, however, stated their view that if a servicer cannot afford to implement the required protections, the servicer should not be permitted to service mortgage loans. Further, a large bank joined in opposing an exemption for small servicers on the basis that such an exemption does not implement consumer protections for customers of small servicers and creates artificial distinctions that provide a competitive advantage to small servicers.", 
                        "The Bureau also received a significant number of comments from small banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers, as well as their trade associations, that requested that the Bureau consider an exemption for small servicers from the mortgage servicing rules, including the discretionary rulemakings. The Bureau also received a comment letter from Advocacy urging the implementation of a small servicer exemption for requirements in Regulation X.", 
                        "Many of the small banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers that provided comments stated that their business models necessarily facilitate communication with delinquent borrowers. Per the comments, such servicers have an incentive to work with borrowers to avoid losses because typically, for small servicers, either the mortgage loan is owned by the servicer (or an affiliate) or the servicer has a customer relationship with the borrower to consider. Community banks, credit unions, and Advocacy further stated that the servicing market should not be considered simplistically; small servicers have substantially different business practices than larger servicers, including with respect to considering borrowers for loss mitigation or managing force-placed insurance. Further, such servicers have not been shown to have engaged in the servicing failures that contributed to the financial crisis, including poor oversight of third-party providers, lost documents and other process failures relating to loss mitigation evaluations, or wrongful filing of foreclosure documents that contain false information or fail to comply with applicable law.", 
                        "Comments from small banks, credit unions, non-bank servicers, and their trade associations, suggested various means for defining a small servicer. Most industry commenters indicated that the proposed 1,000 mortgage loan threshold was inadequate because it would capture only the smallest servicers in the market. One trade association commenter stated that a 1,000-mortgage-loan threshold would cover only single-employee servicing operations. Most commenters indicated that the small servicer exemption threshold should be raised to between 5,000 and 15,000 mortgage loans. One commenter indicated that a small servicer threshold should be based on a delinquency percentage or foreclosure filing threshold, while a large community bank servicer stated that a small servicer exemption should include all but the top five servicers by market share.", 
                        "Small servicers indicated several components of the rulemaking that would have particularly problematic impacts on small servicers. For example, many small servicers and their trade associations raised concerns regarding the appeal process set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(h). Small servicers stated that required independent reviews for the appeal process would be difficult to implement because the size of a small servicer necessarily constrains the number of knowledgeable servicing personnel that would be able to conduct the independent review. Per the commenters, the resulting review would be without value because the independent review would be conducted by employees less familiar with, or skilled in, evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options. Small servicers also indicated they would be burdened by implementing new notice requirements, including those set forth in \u00a7 1024.39 and \u00a7 1024.41, which, commenters believed, would only serve to require communications that are already occurring, but would impose the cost of requirements to track communications and demonstrate compliance to appropriate regulators.", 
                        "In addition to the comments, the Bureau reviewed the input gained through outreach with small servicers during the Small Business Review Panel process. As discussed throughout, in order to gain feedback on small servicer impacts, the Bureau participated in a Small Business Review Panel and conducted outreach with small entities that would be subject to the regulations. The Bureau solicited feedback from the small entities participating in the Small Business Review Panel on many elements of the loss mitigation process in conjunction with other elements of the servicing proposals, including impacts on loss mitigation processes of small servicers from proposed rules relating to error resolution, reasonable information management policies and procedures, early intervention for troubled or delinquent borrowers, and continuity of contact. In particular, the Bureau requested feedback from small servicers on the following: (1) A duty to suspend a foreclosure sale while a borrower is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option or other alternative to foreclosure; (2) the ability to adopt policies and procedures to facilitate review of borrowers for loss mitigation options; (3) the ability to provide information regarding loss mitigation early in the foreclosure process to borrowers; and (4) the ability to provide borrowers with the opportunity to discuss evaluations for loss mitigation options with designated servicer contact personnel.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The small entities generally informed the Small Business Review Panel that they engaged in individualized contact with borrowers early in the foreclosure process, that some servicers completed discussions of loss mitigation options with borrowers prior to a point in time when borrowers should receive significant foreclosure-related information, and that small servicers generally worked closely with foreclosure counsel such that foreclosure processes and loss mitigation could be easily conducted simultaneously without prejudice to the loss mitigation process. Further, the small entities explained that they were willing to communicate with borrowers about loss mitigation contemporaneously with the foreclosure process, and one small entity indicated that it would be willing to halt the foreclosure process, if appropriate, in order to consider a modification.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau carefully considered the comments regarding requested exemptions for small servicers, including the comments received from Advocacy. In addition, the Bureau carefully considered the specific aspects of the rule that community banks, small credit unions, and other small servicers indicated would potentially impact those institutions most significantly. The analysis conducted by the Bureau is set forth below, as well as in the analyses required pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.", 
                        "In general, the Bureau is persuaded based on its experience, outreach, and the submission of the comments that the problematic practices that have plagued the servicing industry, particularly in recent years, are to a large extent a function of a business model in which servicing is viewed as a discrete line of business and profit center, and in which servicers compete to secure business from owners or assignees of mortgage loans based upon price. As discussed in greater detail in part II, such a model leads to a high volume, low margin business, in which servicers are not incentivized to invest in operations necessary to handle large numbers of delinquent borrowers. The significant weight of evidence of servicer failures of which the Bureau is aware involved large servicers following such a business model.", 
                        "In contrast, there is a segment of servicers who service a relatively small number of mortgage loans and do not purchase or hold mortgage servicing rights for mortgage loans they do not own or did not originate. Many community bank and small credit union servicers fit this model. For example, the Bureau estimates that 10,829 banks, thrifts, and credit unions service 5,000 or fewer loans. Of these, approximately 96 percent have assets of $1 billion or less, which is the traditional threshold for denoting a community bank. The Bureau is not aware of evidence indicating the performance of these types of institutions in servicing the mortgage loans they originate or own generally results in substantial consumer harm. To the contrary, data available to the Bureau indicates that such servicers achieve significantly reduced levels of borrowers rolling into 90 or more days of delinquency or having a mortgage loan charged-off when compared to the average for all banks. For example, in 2011, the 90+ delinquency rate for community banks was 0.27 percent compared with over 6 percent for all banks. Further, the net charge-off rate for community banks was 0.66 percent against 1.31 percent for all banks. Community bank performance with respect to levels of delinquencies and charge-offs has also remained relatively stable through the financial crisis. From 2007 through 2011, the 90+ delinquency rate fluctuated between 0.27 percent in 2007 to a high of only 0.31 percent in 2009. The equivalent metric for all banks showed the 90+ delinquency rate at 0.80 percent rising rapidly to a high of 6.29 percent in 2011.", 
                        "The reasons for this performance may lay in the fact that small servicers have very different incentives than large servicers. Servicers that service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and only service mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate owns or originated generally must be conscientious of the impact of servicing operations on the borrower. Any such servicer has an interest in maintaining a relationship with borrower as a customer of the bank or thrift or member of the credit union to provide other banking services. Further, such servicers must be conscientious of reputational consequences within a community or member base. Further, to the extent a servicer or an affiliate owns a mortgage loan, the servicer bears risk from the borrower's potential delinquency and default on the mortgage loan obligation and does not have an incentive to engage in practices that may put the performance of the mortgage loan obligation at risk.", 
                        "All of these considerations, as well as the performance data discussed above, persuades the Bureau that the small servicers are generally achieving the goals of the discretionary rulemakings to protect delinquent borrowers. The Bureau recognizes, however, that these small servicers may be achieving these ends through procedures that differ from those mandated in \u00a7 1024.39 and \u00a7 1024.41, with respect to early intervention and loss mitigation procedures, and that while the practice of these small servicers are, in the main, achieving the objectives delineated in \u00a7 104.38 and \u00a7 1024.40, with respect to general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements and continuity of contact, these servicers may not have systems in place to document how they are achieving these results. Thus, the Bureau believes that subjecting the small servicers to these provisions would impose costs that they could find difficult to absorb.", 
                        "In sum, the Bureau is not persuaded at this time that the consumer protection purposes of RESPA necessarily would be furthered by requiring small servicers to comply with the discretionary rulemakings.", 
                        "Accordingly, a small servicer as defined pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4), that is, a servicer that services 5,000 mortgage loans or less and only services mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate owns or originated, is exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1024.38 through 41, with two exceptions.\n            First, \u00a7 1024.41(f) prohibits servicers from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless a borrower's mortgage loan obligation is greater than 120 days delinquent. Second, \u00a7 1024.41(g) prohibits a servicer from, among other things, proceeding with a foreclosure sale if the borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. The Bureau deems it highly unlikely, given the considerations discussed above, that a small servicer would initiate a foreclosure with respect to a borrower who is less than 120 days delinquent to conclude a foreclosure sale if a borrower was performing under a loss mitigation agreement. Nonetheless, the Bureau does not see any reason why these basic protections should not be extended to all borrowers or why subjecting small servicers to these prohibitions would create any burden for them. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(j) extends these two rules to small servicers. The analysis pursuant to section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act, set forth in part VII below, and the final regulatory flexibility analysis, set forth in part VIII below, provide significant additional discussion regarding the assumptions used in determining an appropriate small servicer exemption threshold of 5,000 mortgage loans.", 
                        "The Bureau received comments from a nonprofit lender/servicer indicating that the mortgage servicing rules would be costly and difficult to implement, in light of the commenter's nonprofit mission and volunteer workforce. The commenter indicated that the Bureau should carry over the small servicer exemption proposed with respect to the periodic statement requirement in Regulation Z to the Regulation X requirements and should also implement a narrow exemption for nonprofit servicers. Although the Bureau declines to exempt nonprofit servicers separately, the Bureau believes that such servicers will likely fall within the small servicer exemption established by the Bureau.\n            To the extent a nonprofit servicer services more than 5,000 mortgage loans or services mortgage loans that the servicer or an affiliate does not own or did not originate, then the Bureau believes any such servicer should be required to provide appropriate consumer protection by implementing the loss mitigation procedures, notwithstanding the non-profit status of the servicer.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Other exemptions.</em> In addition to requests for a small servicer exemption, the Bureau received comments that it should implement exemptions for housing finance agencies, reverse mortgage transactions, and servicers that are qualified lenders as defined in regulations established by the Farm Credit Administration. Housing finance agencies and their associations commented that the mission orientation of these agencies weighs in favor of exempting such agencies from certain of the proposed mortgage servicing rules. A comment from one such agency with respect to the Homeowners' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program is instructive. That program assists a borrower experiencing hardship by extending a loan, secured by a subordinate lien on a borrower's property, to bring a borrower's first-lien mortgage loan current and, for certain borrowers, to provide continuing assistance. Absent an exemption, the servicing of the subordinate-lien mortgage loan that secures such assistance would be subject to mortgage servicing rules relating to loss mitigation, notwithstanding that the loan itself is a form of loss mitigation. In addition, the Bureau received comments from housing finance agencies indicating that the costs of certain of the rulemakings may be burdensome for housing finance agencies.", 
                        "The Bureau also received comments from a trade association for reverse mortgage lenders and servicers. The commenter stated that many of the rulemakings, including the discretionary rulemakings, are not appropriate for reverse mortgage transactions. For example, loss mitigation requirements in the proposed rule were based on days of delinquency, which is an imprecise and difficult concept with respect to a reverse mortgage transaction because of the structure of the transaction. Further, the vast majority of reverse mortgage transactions are subject to regulations implemented by FHA in connection with the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.", 
                        "The Bureau received comments from lenders subject to regulations established by the Farm Credit Administration with respect to loss mitigation. These entities requested exemptions for mortgage loans for which a servicer is required to comply with Farm Credit Administration requirements on loss mitigation because those requirements differ markedly from those proposed by the Bureau.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees that additional exemptions are appropriate for certain of the rulemakings. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has determined not to implement these additional exemptions to those regulations that principally implement requirements set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. These include the requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 (Error Resolution Procedures), 1024.36 (Information Requests), and 1024.37 (Force-Placed Insurance). With respect to error resolution procedures and information requests, those provisions build upon the existing Qualified Written Request procedures, which are currently applicable to the servicers discussed above. Providing an exemption to these requirements would have removed a currently existing consumer protection.", 
                        "The Bureau is persuaded that imposing the requirements in the discretionary rulemakings on housing finance agencies does not further the goals of those requirements and imposes undue costs on housing finance agencies. Such agencies are engaged in programs that assist mortgage loan borrowers facing hardship under the auspices of state or local governments. The Bureau believes the mission of these agencies, as articulated by the agencies and their associations, clearly demonstrates that the interests of such agencies are aligned with those of borrowers, so that imposing the discretionary rulemakings on such agencies would not further the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. Accordingly, the Bureau exempts housing finance agencies from the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.38 through 1024.41 as well as the principal restrictions of \u00a7 1024.17(k)(5). To effectuate this exemption, the Bureau simply uses the term \u201csmall servicer,\u201d because Regulation Z, as amended by the 2013 TILA Servicing Rule, defines a housing finance agency as a small servicer without regard to the number of mortgage loans serviced by a housing finance agency.", 
                        "The Bureau also is persuaded that the discretionary rulemakings are not appropriate for reverse mortgage transactions. For example, many of the timing requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 relate to the length of a borrower's delinquency, which is a concept that does not apply cleanly with respect to reverse mortgage transactions. Further, the vast majority of reverse mortgage transactions are subject to regulation by FHA pursuant to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. These regulations provide many protections for borrowers that are appropriate for the specific circumstances of a reverse mortgage transaction. The Bureau continues to consider appropriate requirements for reverse mortgage transactions separately from the mortgage servicing rulemakings.", 
                        "Similarly, the Bureau finds that \u201cqualified lenders\u201d subject to Farm Credit Administration regulation of their loss mitigation practices should be exempt from compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 1024.38-41. The Bureau agrees with the commenters that the Farm Credit Administrations' regulations in this area offer consumer protections comparable to those in the mortgage servicing rules and subjecting such institutions to the new rules would subject such servicers to overlapping, and potentially inconsistent, regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined to exempt a servicer with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000 from the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.38 through 41.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau has determined to revise the scope of certain sections. Section 1024.30(c) implements two limitations on the scope of subpart C. First, \u00a7 1024.33(a) is only applicable to mortgage loans that are secured by first liens. This limitation excludes from coverage subordinate-lien mortgage loans. Section 1024.33(a) is based on the existing \u00a7 1024.21, renumbered in accordance with the reorganization of Regulation X, and \u00a7 1024.21 is already limited to first-lien mortgage loans. When the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking is finalized, the Bureau anticipates that rule will alter the requirements for servicers to comply with \u00a7 1024.33(a). Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is beneficial to require servicers to begin implementing the requirements of \u00a7 1024.33(a) for subordinate-lien mortgage loans, only to have to adjust compliance with \u00a7 1024.33(a) upon finalization of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking. Accordingly, the Bureau is not making a change to the scope of \u00a7 1024.33(a) and retains the limitation on the scope of that requirement to mortgage loans that are secured by a first lien.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to maintain the exclusion for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) covered by TILA and Regulation Z, including open-end lines of credit secured by a first lien, from the mortgage servicing requirements in subpart C of Regulation X. Open-end lines of credit, which may be federally related mortgage loans when secured by a first or subordinate lien on residential real property, have been historically excluded from regulations applicable to mortgage servicing under Regulation X. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> current &#167; 1024.21(a) (defining &#8220;mortgage servicing loan&#8221;). Further, open-end lines of credit are already regulated under Regulation Z. Certain provisions of Regulation Z would substantially overlap with the servicer obligations that would be set forth in subpart C, including, for example, billing error resolution procedures. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 CFR 1026.13. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether to maintain an exemption for open-end lines of credit for the requirements in subpart C.", 
                        "To the extent industry commenters responded to the Bureau's request, they supported the continued exclusion of open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans). Two consumer advocacy groups, however, jointly commented that open-end credit transactions secured by a borrower's principal residence should be fully covered by RESPA. The two commenters stated that consumer protections for open-end lines of credit (home equity plans) are less robust than consumer protections for closed-end credit, particularly in the area of disclosures, error resolution, information requests, and penalties for violation. They expressed concerns that the Bureau has failed to appreciate these differences and the potential for consumer harm when predatory lenders exploit these differences. Additionally, the commenters questioned the Bureau's authority to exempt open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) when the statutory definition of the term \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d does not include such an exemption.", 
                        "The Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate at this time not to apply the requirements in subpart C to open-end credit (home equity lines). Open-end lines of credit secured by a first or subordinate lien on residential real property can constitute a federally related mortgage loans. As stated in the proposal, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) tend to reflect better credit quality than subordinate-lien closed-end mortgage loans and share risk characteristics more similar to other open-end consumer financial products, such as credit cards, because of the access to additional unutilized credit provided by a HELOC.\n            The Bureau understands from discussions with servicers and industry representatives that the servicing of HELOCs tends to differ significantly from closed-end mortgage loans, including with respect to information systems used, lender remedies (including restricting access to the line of credit), and borrower behavior. Further, the Bureau understands that although a household may finance a property solely with an open-end line of credit, the proportion that do so is very small.\n            \n          ", 
                        "In addition, the protections proposed in subpart C of Regulation X are not necessary for open-end lines of credit. As set forth above, separate error resolution and information request requirements exist under Regulation Z for open-end lines of credit. Further, the Bureau understands from servicers of open-end lines of credit that such servicers typically do not maintain escrow accounts for open-end lines of credit, require borrowers to maintain insurance for properties secured by open-end lines of credit, or force-place insurance for such borrowers. The Bureau believes that it would contravene the consumer protection purposes of RESPA for servicers to expend resources complying with overlapping or unnecessary requirements that would not benefit consumers.", 
                        "Further, open-end lines of credit perform differently from closed-end mortgages with respect to loss mitigation. A borrower is in control of an open-end line of credit and can draw from that line as necessary to meet financial obligations. Many borrowers who have become delinquent on a first lien closed-end mortgage loan keep current on payments for subordinate lien open-end lines of credit in order to maintain their access to the line of credit.\n            Conversely, when borrowers experience difficulty meeting their obligations, lenders have the ability to cut off access to unutilized draws from the open-end line of credit. These features of open-end lines of credit weigh against imposing the requirements set forth for early intervention with delinquent borrowers, continuity of contact, and loss mitigation procedures on servicers for open-end lines of credit. Further, open-end lines of credit tend to differ from closed-end mortgage loans with respect to servicing information systems utilized.", 
                        "For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to maintain the current exemption, which HUD originally adopted as 24 CFR 3500.21 nearly 20 years ago. Accordingly, this exemption is authorized under section 19(a) of RESPA.", 
                        "In addition, \u00a7 1024.30(c)(2) limits the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence. The purpose of the early intervention requirement, the continuity of contact requirement, and the loss mitigation procedures is to help borrowers stay in their principal residences, where possible, while mitigating the losses of loan owners and assignees, by ensuring that servicers use clear standards of review for loss mitigation options. The Bureau does not believe that this purpose is furthered by extending those protections to mortgage loans for investment, vacation, or other properties that are not principal residences. For example, in such circumstances, the protections set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39-41 may only serve to assist a non-occupying borrower to maintain cash flow from rental revenue during a period of delinquency. Further, for certain properties that are not principal residences, there is a significant risk that a property may not be maintained and may present hazards and blight to local communities. Thus, for investment or vacation properties, the lack of borrower occupancy, and the potential rental income obtained by the borrower, vitiates the justifications for ensuring that a foreclosure process is not undertaken unless the borrower has the opportunity for review for a loss mitigation option. Finally, this limitation is consistent with the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and the National Mortgage Settlement, and its incorporation here furthers the goal of creating uniform standards.\n            Accordingly, the Bureau has limited the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by properties that are borrowers' principal residences."

The Bureau proposed to add a new defined term &#8220;Day&#8221; in proposed &#167; 1024.31.

No comments were received on these proposed defined terms. The final rule adopts these terms as proposed.",

The statute generally defines &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; as hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage.&#8221; <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> section 6(k)(2). Thus, the statutory definition of &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; indicates that Congress intended the term &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; to mean a type of &#8220;hazard insurance.&#8221; However, neither the statute nor current Regulation X defines &#8220;hazard insurance.&#8221; The Bureau believed that it was necessary to define &#8220;hazard insurance&#8221; in order to implement the statute.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to add new defined term \u201cHazard insurance\u201d in proposed \u00a7 1024.31 to mean insurance on the property securing a mortgage loan that protects the property against loss caused by fire, wind, flood, earthquake, theft, falling objects, freezing, and other similar hazards for which the owner or assignee of such loan requires insurance. The Bureau modeled the definition of \u201chazard insurance\u201d on the definition of \u201cproperty insurance\u201d in typical mortgage loan contracts, in light of the fact that the statute generally prohibits servicers from obtaining force-placed insurance \u201cunless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain property insurance.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> section 6(k)(1)(A). The Bureau thus interpreted the statute to mean that &#8220;force-placed hazard insurance&#8221; refers to &#8220;property insurance&#8221; that the borrower has failed to maintain as required by the borrower's mortgage loan contract.", 
                        "The Bureau sought comment on the definition in general and in particular on the proposed inclusion of insurance to protect against flood loss. Although including flood insurance is consistent with the way typical mortgage loan contracts define \u201cproperty insurance,\u201d the Bureau did not believe that the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations should apply to servicers when they are required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) to purchase hazard insurance to protect against flood loss. The FDPA provides an extensive set of restrictions on flood insurance provision, and the Bureau was concerned that overlapping regulatory restrictions would be unduly burdensome and produce little consumer benefit. The Bureau thus proposed to include flood insurance as part of the general definition of \u201cHazard insurance,\u201d but to exclude flood insurance that is required under the FDPA from the definition of \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(a)(2)(i).", 
                        "The Bureau did not receive comments from consumer groups or industry commenters on the proposed defined term \u201cHazard insurance\u201d other than with respect to the treatment of flood insurance. On that topic, most industry commenters believed that simply excluding flood insurance obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of the term \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(a)(2)(i) was workable and adequately mitigated the risk of a servicer having to comply with both regulations under the FDPA and the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations. But one large bank servicer and one large force-placed insurance provider urged the Bureau to exclude flood insurance from the defined term \u201cHazard insurance\u201d in \u00a7 1024.31 instead.", 
                        "The large bank servicer expressed concern that the proposed definitions of \u201chazard insurance\u201d and \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d would effectively require a servicer to strictly monitor any potential change in a mortgage's property's flood zone designation because whether the FDPA requires a servicer to obtain hazard insurance to protect against flood loss depends, among other things, on whether a property is located in an area designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The commenter thus worried that the force-placed insurance requirements of \u00a7 1024.37 would become applicable instantaneously after a change in SFHA designations if that change meant that flood insurance was no longer required under the FDPA for a particular property. The Bureau, however, does not interpret \u00a7 1024.37 to apply in this way. Compliance with \u00a7 1024.37 would be required if the servicer decides to renew or replace a flood insurance policy that had been previously been required under the FDPA with a new policy after the property's SFHA designation had changed. As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to exclude hazard insurance required by the FDPA from the definition of \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d because the Bureau believes that the FDPA and other related Federal laws adequately regulated this activity. However, if a servicer chooses to renew or replace hazard insurance to protect against flood loss even though the insurance the renewal or replacement is no longer required by the FDPA, then the FDPA would not apply. The Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations are intended to fill precisely this gap to ensure that consumers have basic procedural and substantive protections in the absence of FDPA coverage. Thus, a servicer would have to check a property's flood zone designation when a servicer is about to renew or replace hazard insurance to protect against flood loss that the servicer originally obtained pursuant to the FDPA to determine whether the status has changed such that \u00a7 1024.37 would apply going forward. The Bureau believes that this presents minimal if any burden on servicers and is justified to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on borrowers.", 
                        "The large force-placed insurance provider urged the same result based on statutory interpretation grounds, asserting that Congress had not intended to include flood insurance as a type of hazard insurance that would potentially be subject to the force-placed insurance requirements because section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which governs the establishment of escrow accounts for certain higher-priced mortgage loans, contains separate definitions for \u201chazard insurance\u201d and \u201cflood insurance.\u201d The commenter acknowledged that section 1461 is distinct from section 1463 and amends different underlying statutes, TILA and RESPA respectively. Nonetheless, it asserted that both address insurance for which premiums could be paid through the establishment of escrow accounts and therefore should be interpreted in tandem.", 
                        "Again, the Bureau declines to make this change. The Bureau does not believe that Congress intended the statutory definition of \u201cflood insurance\u201d and \u201chazard insurance\u201d in section 1461 to control the interpretation of \u201chazard insurance\u201d for purposes of section 1463(a). Indeed, section 1461 expressly limits its scope by stating that \u201cFor purposes of this section, the following definitions [of \u201cflood insurance\u201d and \u201chazard insurance\u201d] shall apply.\u201d In light of this language, the Bureau does not believe that section 1461 controls. Section 1463(a) itself demonstrates that Congress expected the force-placed insurance provisions to apply to flood insurance other than that required by the FDPA. Section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(4) of RESPA states that nothing in the force-placed insurance provisions shall be construed as prohibiting a servicer from providing simultaneous or concurrent notice of a lack of flood insurance pursuant to the FDPA. This provision would have little impact if flood insurance could <em data-original=\"E-03\">never</em> be considered force-placed insurance within the meaning of section 1463. Thus, the Bureau believes its interpretation of the statutory terms to apply the force-place insurance requirements to flood insurance that is not required by the FDPA and thus not subject to that statute's extensive regulation is consistent with the statutory language, congressional intent, and consumers' interests. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts the proposed defined term &#8220;Hazard insurance&#8221; as proposed.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Loss mitigation application.&#8221;</em> Proposed &#167; 1024.31 would have defined a loss mitigation application as a submission from a borrower requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option in accordance with procedures established by the servicer for the submission of such requests. As discussed below with respect to &#167; 1024.41, the Bureau received comments from large bank servicers regarding the application of the loss mitigation requirements on pre-qualification and informal oral communications with borrowers.", 
                        "Based on the consideration of those comments, the Bureau has determined to revise the definition of a loss mitigation application. The Bureau believes that a loss mitigation application differentiates a communication or inquiry from a borrower regarding loss mitigation options from a borrower's request for consideration for a loss mitigation option. When a borrower, orally or writing, expresses an interest in a loss mitigation option and provides any information that would be evaluated by a servicer, that communication should be considered a loss mitigation application. A servicer must then determine whether the loss mitigation application is complete or incomplete pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41(b). This definition of a loss mitigation application is similar to framework established in Regulation B with respect to an application for credit.", 
                        "Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.31 states that a loss mitigation application means an oral or written request for a loss mitigation option that is accompanied by any information required by a servicer for evaluation for a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Loss mitigation option.&#8221;</em> Pursuant to the Bureau's authorities under RESPA sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a), the Bureau proposed rules on error resolution (proposed &#167; 1024.35), information management (proposed &#167; 1024.38), early intervention (proposed &#167; 1024.39), continuity of contact (proposed &#167; 1024.40), and loss mitigation (proposed &#167; 1024.41) that would have set forth servicer duties with respect to &#8220;Loss mitigation options.&#8221;", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to define \u201cLoss mitigation options\u201d at new \u00a7 1024.31 as \u201calternatives available from the servicer to the borrower to avoid foreclosure.\u201d The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-1 that loss mitigation options include temporary and long-term relief, and options that allow borrowers to remain in or leave their homes, such as, without limitation, refinancing, trial or permanent modification, repayment of the amount owed over an extended period of time, forbearance of future payments, short-sale, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loss mitigation programs sponsored by a State or the Federal Government. The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 that loss mitigation options available from the servicer include options offered by the owner or assignee of the loan that are made available through the servicer.", 
                        "Several industry commenters addressed the Bureau's proposed definition of \u201cLoss mitigation options.\u201d One industry commenter recommended that the term \u201cLoss mitigation options\u201d should be defined as alternatives available \u201cfrom the investor through the servicer to the borrower\u201d to avoid foreclosure, in light of the general industry practice that loss mitigation options are generally authorized by investors rather than servicers. While one industry trade group supported the proposed definition, other commenters were concerned that the breadth of the definition could conflict with servicers' delinquency management programs because the definition would subject short-term cures to the same procedural requirements as more permanent options. Similarly, industry commenters were concerned that the proposed definition would be inconsistent with requirements under existing loss mitigation programs, such as Farm Credit Administration rules and portions of the National Mortgage Settlement.", 
                        "In light of comments and upon further consideration, the Bureau is adopting a definition of the term \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d substantially as proposed, but that incorporates the substance of proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 into the regulatory text. Accordingly, the final rule defines the term \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d as an alternative to foreclosure offered by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that is made available through the servicer to the borrower.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to define \u201cLoss mitigation options\u201d as alternatives available \u201cfrom the servicer\u201d to reflect the practical, day-to-day relationship between borrowers and servicers, in which servicers pursue loss mitigation activities with respect to delinquent borrowers on behalf of the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans. The Bureau had proposed to add comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 to clarify that the proposed definition should be read to include options offered by the owner and assignee and made available through the servicer in light of the actual legal relationship between servicers and owners or assignees, in which the owner or assignee authorizes the offering of loss mitigation options. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that the text of the definition should reflect the underlying legal relationship between servicers and owners or assignees to avoid confusion over whether servicers may be able to authorize loss mitigation options independent of the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting comment 31 (Loss mitigation options)-2 as proposed, but instead is amending the proposed definition to incorporate the substance of proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-2.", 
                        "The definition of the term \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d is broad to account for the wide variety of options that may be available to a borrower, the availability of which may vary depending on the underlying loan documents, any servicer obligations to the lender or assignee of the loan, the borrower's particular circumstances, and the flexibility the servicer has in arranging alternatives with the borrower. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-1 substantially as proposed to set forth examples of loss mitigation options \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d The Bureau has revised proposed comment 31 (Loss mitigation option)-1 to clarify that loss mitigation options include programs sponsored by \u201ca locality\u201d as well as a State or the Federal government and other non-substantive revisions describing options that allow borrowers \u201cwho are behind on their mortgage payments to remain in their homes or to leave their homes without a foreclosure.\u201d", 
                        "While the Bureau has developed a broad definition of loss mitigation options in order to accommodate the variety of loss mitigation programs, the Bureau does not intend for the provisions of Regulation X that use the term \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d to require servicers to offer options that are inconsistent with any investor or guarantor requirements. Thus, under the Bureau's definition, an alternative that is not made available by the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan would not be a loss mitigation option for purposes of the final rule. The Bureau discusses the final rules that use the term \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d in the applicable section-by-section analysis below.", 
                        "The final rule includes new language in comment 31 (Loss mitigation option) -2, which explains that a loss mitigation option available through the servicer refers to an option for which a borrower may apply, even if the borrower ultimately does not qualify for such option. The Bureau has included this comment to clarify that the regulatory text's reference to options \u201cavailable\u201d to borrowers is not intended to restrict the definition to options for which a borrower ultimately qualifies, but instead refers to options for which a borrower may apply.",

For example, a qualified written request may request information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan but not assert that an error relating to the servicing of a loan has occurred.",

The Bureau agrees that it would be helpful to clarify that the error resolution and information request requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request, and accordingly, is adopting new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2 for that purpose. However, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to discuss a servicer's penalties for violation of the Bureau's regulations in either the regulation or the commentary.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau has made slight modifications to the proposed definition of \u201cqualified written request\u201d so it more closely tracks the definition included in section 6(e)(1) of RESPA. The final rule defines \u201cqualified written request\u201d to mean a written correspondence from the borrower to the servicer that includes, or otherwise enables the servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower, and either: (1) States the reasons the borrower believes the account is in error; or (2) provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding information relating to the servicing of the mortgage loan sought by the borrower.",

The Bureau proposed related commentary, comment 31 (service provider)-1, that would have clarified that service providers may include attorneys retained to represent a servicer or an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan in a foreclosure proceeding, as well as other professionals retained to provide appraisals or inspections of properties. Two industry groups representing appraisal professionals submitted joint comments that objected to the inclusion of appraisal professionals in the Bureau's proposed comment 31 (service provider)-1. The commenters sought clarification from the Bureau about the circumstances under which appraisers are &#8220;service providers&#8221; and what their obligations would be. The Bureau believes that comment 31 (service provider)-1 is clear in describing the circumstances under which appraisal professionals are &#8220;service providers&#8221; and thus feels no further explanation is required. While acknowledging that the Bureau's mortgage servicing rules do not directly regulate real estate appraisal services, the commenters claimed that individual appraisers and small appraisal firms would experience costly and unnecessary hardship if they were considered &#8220;service providers.&#8221; The Bureau disagrees. The definition of the term &#8220;service provider&#8221; in &#167; 1024.31, by its terms, applies only for purposes of subpart C, and the term &#8220;service provider&#8221; appears only in &#167; 1024.38 of subpart C. Section 1024.38 requires servicers maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that they can exercise reasonable oversight of their service providers. The Bureau does not believe that requiring servicers to exercise reasonable oversight of their service providers will lead to costly and unnecessary hardship on individual appraisers and small appraisal firms.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Subservicer.&#8221;</em> The Bureau proposed to adopt the defined term &#8220;Subservicer&#8221; included in current &#167; 1024.21(a) in proposed &#167; 1024.31 without change. The proposed defined term &#8220;Subservicer&#8221; provides that a &#8220;subservicer&#8221; is any servicer who does not own the right to perform servicing, but who performs servicing on behalf of the master servicer.", 
                        "One commenter suggested that the Bureau should replace the reference to \u201cmaster servicer\u201d in the definition of \u201csubservicer\u201d with \u201cservicer\u201d to accommodate circumstances where there are multiple levels of subservicing. The example the commenter provided is one where there is one master servicer, but also a primary servicer and multiple subservicers. It appears that the commenter's concern is that people might be confused by thinking \u201cprimary servicers\u201d would not be considered \u201csubservicers\u201d for purposes of subpart C of Regulation X. Based on the example provided by the commenter, the Bureau understands that a primary servicer is performing servicing on behalf of the master servicer, who owns the right to perform servicing. Because the primary servicer is not the owner of the right to perform servicing, it would be a \u201csubservicer\u201d pursuant to the proposed definition to the defined term \u201cSubservicer.\u201d Although industry practice may differentiate between levels of subservicing by referring to a servicer that directly performs servicing on behalf of a master servicer as the \u201cprimary servicer,\u201d and servicers performing on behalf of the \u201cprimary servicer\u201d as \u201csubservicers,\u201d for purposes of subpart C, any servicer that does not own the servicing right but performs servicing on behalf of a servicer that owns the servicing right is a subservicer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes the proposed definition to the defined term \u201cSubservicer\u201d adequately captures situations where there are multiple levels of subservicing and the defined term \u201cSubservicer\u201d is adopted as proposed."

Current \u00a7 1024.21(b) and (c) implements requirements in RESPA section 6(a) related to the servicing disclosure statement. The Bureau's proposed \u00a7 1024.33(a) would have made certain changes to the requirements currently set forth in \u00a7 1024.21(b) and (c) pertaining to the servicing disclosure statement, including changes to the scope of applicability and delivery of the servicing disclosure statement, and certain other non-substantive technical revisions.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions to conform \u00a7 1024.33(a) to the comprehensive amendments to consumer mortgage disclosures proposed by the Bureau in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.\n            Because the Bureau intended to incorporate the servicing disclosure statement requirements of RESPA section 6(a) into the consolidated disclosure forms for the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rulemaking, the Bureau had proposed to limit the scope of the servicing disclosure statement provisions in new \u00a7 1024.33 to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions because those transactions would not be covered by the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.", 
                        "After additional consideration, because the Bureau will not be finalizing the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal until after this final rule, the Bureau has decided not to finalize the language in proposed \u00a7 1024.33(a) that would have limited the scope of the provision to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. Instead, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1024.33(a) by conforming the scope to \u201cmortgage loans\u201d other than subordinate-lien mortgage loans, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.30(c) above. The Bureau is excluding subordinate liens in order to maintain the current coverage of the servicing disclosure statement requirement in Regulation X.\n            HUD initially implemented this exemption in reliance on its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA;\n            the Bureau relies on the same authority to maintain the current exemption. Accordingly, in the final rule, the Bureau has added language to \u00a7 1024.33(a) so that applicants for \u201cfirst-lien mortgage loans\u201d must receive the servicing disclosure statement, as indicated at \u00a7 1024.30(c)(1). Thus, applicants for both reverse and forward mortgage loans must receive the servicing disclosure statement. The Bureau expects to harmonize the scope of \u00a7 1024.33(a) in the final rule implementing the TILA-RESPA integrated disclosures and to provide for consolidated disclosure forms at that time.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed to add comment 33(a)(1)-2 to \u00a7 1024.33(a) to clarify that the servicing disclosure statement need only be provided to the \u201cprimary applicant.\u201d Current \u00a7 1024.21(b) requires that the servicing disclosure statement be provided to mortgage servicing loan applicants, and current \u00a7 1024.21(c) provides that if co-applicants indicate the same address on their application, one copy delivered to that address is sufficient, but that if different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants. The Bureau proposed to implement through commentary to \u00a7 1024.33(a) a clarification relating to providing a servicing disclosure statement for co-applicants\u2014that when an application involves more than one applicant, notification need only be given to one applicant but must be given to the primary applicant when one is readily apparent. A credit union trade association supported this proposed change.", 
                        "In its proposal, the Bureau explained that the modified requirement would reduce burdens on servicers without significantly reducing consumer protections, given that the Bureau proposed to apply the regulation only to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. The Bureau explained that such transactions are typically only conducted with regard to a borrower's principal residence and do not involve ongoing consumer payments for the life of the loan, so that contact with servicers is generally quite minimal. The Bureau also observed that amending the current requirement would be consistent with disclosure requirements applicable to other Bureau regulations, such as the adverse action notice required under Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act).\n            \n          ", 
                        "Because the Bureau is not limiting \u00a7 1024.33(a) to closed-end reverse mortgage transactions in the final rule, as originally proposed, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 33(a)(1)-2 as proposed and is not amending the existing requirement in \u00a7 1024.21(c), under which the servicing disclosure statement must be provided to co-applicants if different addresses are shown by co-applicants. Instead, comment 33(a)-2 contains the same guidance that originally appeared in \u00a7 1024.21(c): That if co-applicants indicate the same address on their application, one copy of the servicing disclosure statement delivered to that address is sufficient; and that if different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants.", 
                        "Finally, in addition to proposing changes about the scope of the rule, the Bureau proposed in \u00a7 1024.33(a) to make certain non-substantive changes to language from current \u00a7 1024.21(b) and (c) to clarify the circumstances under which the servicing disclosure statement must be provided and the proper use of appendix MS-1, which provides a model form for the servicing disclosure statement. For example, \u00a7 1024.21(b) currently provides that the servicing disclosure statement must be provided \u201c[a]t the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within three days after submission of the application.\u201d The Bureau's proposed \u00a7 1024.33(a) stated that the servicing disclosure statement must be provided \u201c[w]ithin three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after a person applies [.]\u201d The Bureau also proposed to incorporate some of the language currently in \u00a7 1024.21(b) and (c) into new Regulation X official commentary. For example, the Bureau proposed to move \u00a7 1024.21(b)(1), which explained use of appendix MS-2, to new comment 33(a)-1; the Bureau also included generally applicable instructions for use of model forms and clauses in commentary to appendix MS. The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal and adopts these revisions substantially as proposed, other than with respect to the scope of the rule, discussed above.", 
                        "In the final rule, the Bureau has replaced the phrase \u201ctable funding mortgage broker\u201d with the phrase \u201cmortgage broker who anticipates using table funding,\u201d which the Bureau believes is clearer and better conforms to the term that currently appears in \u00a7 1024.21(b)(1). In addition, the Bureau has consolidated proposed comments 33(a)(2)-1, -2, and -3 into comment 33(a)-3, which contains disclosure preparation instructions currently in \u00a7 1024.21(b)(2).\n            Comment 33(a)-3 explains that, if the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan knows at the time of the disclosure whether it will service the mortgage loan for which the applicant has applied, the disclosure should, as applicable, state that such entity will service such loan and does not intend to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing of the loan, or that such entity intends to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of such mortgage loan before the first payment is due. The comment also provides that, in all other instances, a disclosure that states that the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred while the loan is outstanding complies with \u00a7 1024.33(a).", 
                        "The final rule also makes a technical revision to the last sentence of proposed \u00a7 1024.33(a). The final rule provides that the servicing disclosure statement is not required to be delivered if \u201ca person who applies for a first-lien mortgage loan is denied credit\u201d within the three-day period."

They recommended that transferees should be required to provide the transfer notice 30 to 45 days in advance of the effective date of transfer. In its final rule, the Bureau is not adjusting the exiting timing requirements. The 15-day time period was established by Congress, which reasonably concluded that this time period provides borrowers with sufficient time to make adjustments to any automated payment systems. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is minimal risk to borrowers who may be unable to send payments to the proper servicer after a transfer. Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.33(c)(1), servicers generally may not treat a payment as late for 60 days after a transfer if a borrower makes a timely but misdirected payment to the transferee servicer.",

The Bureau proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 to clarify that a notice of transfer should be delivered to the mailing address listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents, unless the borrower has notified the servicer of a new address pursuant to the servicer's requirements for receiving a notice of a change of address. Proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 further clarified that when a mortgage loan has more than one borrower, the notice of transfer need only be given to one borrower, but must be given to the primary borrower when one is readily apparent.",

However, the Bureau did receive comment on the proposed language clarifying that servicers may provide the transfer notice to the \u201cprimary\u201d borrower. Industry commenters supported the proposed limitation to provide the transfer notice only to the primary borrower. One industry commenter indicated, however, that servicers generally will not know who the primary borrower is, noting that servicers would likely rely on the owner's or a prior servicer's designation in servicer transfer instructions, or the party that is listed first on the note. The industry commenter recommended that the Bureau permit such reliance.", 
                                "Two consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau omit this comment. These commenters were concerned that providing notice to only one party would not ensure that multiple obligors, or even the party who is actually making payments on the mortgage, would receive it. For example, in the event of a divorce or separation, a \u201cprimary\u201d borrower could be a spouse who is no longer living at home but who has submitted a change-of-address notice to the servicer. In another scenario, a borrower not living at home could be under a family court order to make mortgage payments even though the borrower is not a \u201cprimary\u201d borrower. In these types of cases, the consumer groups were concerned that borrowers not considered \u201cprimary\u201d would not receive the transfer notice. The consumer groups also raised concern about the lack of a definition of \u201cprimary\u201d borrower and observed that, even if a definition were provided, a servicer's original designation of \u201cprimary\u201d may become inaccurate over time if the obligors' relationship changes or other changed circumstances arise. The consumer groups also noted that sending two notices is not costly, would simplify compliance, and would reduce the risk that an interested borrower would not receive the notice.",

The Bureau recognizes that a party who may be \u201cprimary\u201d at application could change over time without the servicer's knowledge, which could be problematic for borrowers responsible for making ongoing payments to their servicer. The Bureau believes that servicers should be responsible for providing a notice to the address listed by the borrower in the mortgage loan documents or different addresses they have received through their own procedures, consistent with \u00a7 1024.11\n            and applicable case law.\n\n            The Bureau has otherwise retained proposed comment 33(b)(3)-2 substantially as proposed.

The Bureau does not believe that the timing for providing a servicing transfer disclosure should differ for an insured credit union in the process of conservatorship of liquidation by the NCUA compared to an insured depository institution in the process of conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC.

These requirements are currently implemented by \u00a7 1024.21(d)(3)(i) through (vi).

Thus, the consumer groups recommended that the transfer notices should advise if the homeowner is current and whether there are any unpaid fees, and the status of loss mitigation options being considered. They also recommended that a full payment history, including allocation of the payments to interest, principal, late fees, and other fees should be included by both the old and the new servicer, so that the homeowner may promptly ascertain if there is a discrepancy in the records. These commenters also requested that the Bureau require that fees not listed in a payment history provided at the transfer of servicing be waived.", 
                                "The Bureau recognizes the problems that can arise when servicing is transferred, especially in the case of a borrower who is not current at the time of transfer. However, requiring individualized information about each borrower's loan could significantly affect the time required to produce the notice as well as the cost. Moreover, the Bureau believes that other new provisions being finalized in Regulation X and Regulation Z will adequately address borrowers' interests in ensuring the accuracy of transferred records concerning their payment history. First, borrowers will be able to obtain information about their current payment status on a monthly basis on the periodic statement required under the Regulation Z provision that the Bureau is finalizing in the 2013 TILA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule. That statement will show, among other things, the payment amount due, the amount of any late payment fee, the total sum of any fees or charges imposed since the last statement, the total of all payments received since the last statement, the total of all payments received since the beginning of the current calendar year, transaction activity since the last statement, the outstanding principal balance, the borrower's delinquency status, amounts past due from previous billing cycles, and the total payment amount needed to bring the account current. As a result, if there are discrepancies between the last statement provided by the prior servicer and the first statement provided by the new servicer, those discrepancies will be apparent on the face of the statements. Second, borrowers will also be able to assert errors and request information about their payment history and current status through the new error resolution and information request provisions of Regulation X \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36; and new \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1)(iii) requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can provide a borrower with accurate and timely information and documents in response to the borrower's requests for information with respect to the servicing of the borrower's mortgage loan account. Third, new \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4) generally requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure (as a transferor servicer) the timely transfer of all information and documents in a manner that ensures the accuracy of information and documents transferred, and (as a transferee servicer) identify necessary documents or information that may not have been transferred by a transferor servicer and obtain such documents from the transferor servicer. Fourth, new \u00a7 1024.38(c)(2) generally requires, among other things, that servicers maintain a schedule of all transactions credited or debited to the mortgage loan account, including any escrow account defined in \u00a7 1024.17(b) and any suspense account and data in a manner that facilitates compiling such documents and data into a servicing file within five days. In light of these provisions, the Bureau does not believe that the cost of providing the default status of the loan or a full payment history with the servicing transfer notice for all borrowers would be justified.",

The Bureau proposed to remove this requirement from the servicing transfer notice in new &#167; 1024.33(b)(4). Two consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau retain the current requirement, noting that borrowers would benefit from being informed of their rights related to errors and information requests. They asserted that retaining an existing disclosure would not add new burden. Further, they asserted that omitting the disclosure would not significantly reduce burden because the language in the proposed revised model notice (without the complaint resolution statement) at appendix MS-2 would likely only comprise one page, and that adding a paragraph about the error resolution and information rights might at most extend some of the information to the back side of the notice, but would not require an additional page or increased postage.", 
                                "After considering the comments received, the Bureau has decided to adopt \u00a7 1024.33(b)(4) without a requirement to provide information about complaint resolution, as proposed. The Bureau believes that borrowers are best served by providing a notice that clearly and concisely explains that the servicing of their mortgage is being transferred, and that detailed information about the error resolution and information request process may not always be optimally located in the transfer notice. Additionally, as a result of amendments to the error resolution and information request procedures that the Bureau is finalizing in this rule, the existing disclosure in current appendix MS-2 would no longer be completely accurate.", 
                                "The Bureau agrees that borrowers should be notified of their rights in connection with errors and inquiries, but the Bureau believes that borrowers should be informed of the error resolution and information request process through mechanisms that do not necessarily depend on the transfer of servicing. To address this, the Bureau is adding a requirement in \u00a7 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers inform borrowers of procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in \u00a7 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in \u00a7 1024.36. New comment 38(b)(5)-1 explains, among other things, that a servicer may comply with \u00a7 1024.38(b)(5) by including in the periodic statement required pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41 a brief statement informing borrowers that borrowers have certain rights under Federal law related to resolving errors and requesting information about their account, and that they may learn more about their rights by contacting the servicer, and a statement directing borrowers to a Web site that provides the information about the procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau believes that a requirement to establish policies and procedures to achieve the objective of notifying borrowers of the written error resolution and information request procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 36 will provide servicers with more flexibility to the time and in a manner in which to notify borrowers about the written error resolution and information request procedures. Specifically, the Bureau expects that servicers may decide to inform borrowers about these procedures at a time and in a manner that borrowers are more likely to find beneficial than at the time of servicing transfer. Further, as described in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.40, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(b)(4), servicers must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that continuity of contact personnel assigned to assist delinquent borrowers provide such borrowers with information about the procedures for submitting a notice of error pursuant to \u00a7 1024.35 or an information request pursuant to \u00a7 1024.36.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau believes borrowers are most likely to raise questions and complaints with servicers outside of the formal process outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 36. To ensure that servicers have systems in place for responding to errors and information requests through informal means, the Bureau believes servicers should have reasonable policies and procedures in place for responding to errors and information requests that fall outside of the required error resolution and information request procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 36. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1), the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can investigate, respond to, and, as appropriate, make corrections in response to borrower complaints, and provide accurate and timely information and documents in response to borrower information requests. Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting the proposal to remove the requirement that the servicing transfer notice describe the complaint resolution statement currently set forth in \u00a7 1024.21(d)(3)(vii)."

The Bureau proposed to implement these requirements, currently in \u00a7 1024.21(d)(3)(ii) and (iii), through new \u00a7 1024.33(b)(4)(ii) and (iii).",

The Bureau had also proposed in \u00a7 1024.33(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) to remove the requirement that the transferor and transferee servicers provide collect call telephone numbers, but to retain the requirement to provide toll-free telephone numbers. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 1024.33(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) would have required that servicers provide only a toll-free telephone number for an employee or department of the transferee servicer that can be contacted by the borrower to obtain answers to servicing transfer inquiries. The Bureau's proposal also would have required that the transferor notice include the address for an employee or department of the transferor servicer that can be contacted by the borrower to obtain answers to servicing transfer inquiries. Current \u00a7 1024.21(d)(3)(iii) requires only that the notice list telephone contact information to reach an employee or department of the transferor servicer.", 
                        "One industry commenter indicated that providing an individual employee name may not be appropriate in all cases because individuals can change roles within a servicer's organization. The commenter requested that only contact information for a servicing department be required. One individual consumer recommended requiring that the notice of transfer identify the owner or assignee of the loan, without contact information, in addition to contact information for the transferor and transferee servicers. Another individual consumer also recommended that the transfer notice include a plain language explanation of what \u201cowning\u201d and \u201cservicing\u201d a loan mean.",

However, the Bureau is retaining the option to include a collect call number because, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes some servicers may continue to use collect call numbers. The Bureau is also retaining the requirement to provide contact information for either an employee or department in the final rule. Neither the statute nor the regulatory provision requires servicers to list specific employees but instead gives servicers the option of listing personnel or a department contact number. The Bureau believes servicers should be able to determine the most appropriate point of contact within their organizations. While the Bureau recognizes that servicer personnel may change over time, the Bureau does not believe that there is significant risk from the potential that contact information may be inaccurate because servicers are required under \u00a7 1024.38 to have policies and procedures in place to achieve the objective of providing accurate information to borrowers. Servicers may choose to provide department-level contacts to ease their own compliance. The Bureau believes borrowers would likely benefit from the disclosure of specific employees to the extent the servicer decides to list them.",

First, the Bureau notes that the servicing disclosure statement provided at application pursuant to \u00a7 1024.33(a) already provides information about whether the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer may assign, sell, or transfer the mortgage servicing to any other person at any time. Additionally, the Bureau believes the language in the model form at appendix MS-2, explaining that a new servicer will be collecting the borrower's mortgage loan payments and that nothing else about the borrower's mortgage loan will change, will avoid potential confusion about what the transfer of servicing means for a borrower's loan. Additionally, as explained above, the Bureau believes that borrowers are best served by a transfer notice that sets forth the most relevant information related to the transfer of servicing of their loan and who should receive their payments requiring additional information in the notice about the owner or the loan may be confusing. Finally, the servicing transfer notice will include contact information for the transferor and transferee servicer that the borrower may contact with any questions.\n            \n          "

Section 1024.33(c)(2) now provides that, beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, with respect to payments received incorrectly by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer that should properly receive the payment on the loan), the transferor servicer shall promptly take action described in either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii). The Bureau has modeled this language on the language of \u00a7 1024.33(c)(1) (payments not considered late). The Bureau does not intend any substantive difference from proposed \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2).", 
                        "The Bureau has also added language to \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2)(ii) to provide that if a servicer does not transfer a misdirected payment to the transferee servicer, the servicer must return the payment to the person that made the payment to the transferor servicer and notify the payor of the proper recipient of the payment. The Bureau believes \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2) will ensure that transferor servicers take some action with respect to misdirected payments; otherwise, transferor servicers may claim that they had no obligation with respect to misdirected payments. The Bureau also believes it is reasonable to permit transferors to either return a misdirected payment to the payor or transmit the payment to the transferee servicer because there may be circumstances in which a borrower would want to be notified that the payment had been mailed to the wrong servicer, recoup the misdirected payment, and forward it to the correct servicer. In addition, there may be situations in which a transferor servicer receives a payment from a party it does not recognize as the borrower associated with the mortgage loan account. In such situations, the Bureau believes servicers may reasonably determine the best course of action is to return such a payment to the payor. Moreover, the Bureau does not believe there is significant potential for borrower harm associated with \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2) because \u00a7 1024.33(c)(1) permits a 60-day grace period in which timely but misdirected payments to the transferor servicer may not be considered late for any purpose. In addition, \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2) requires the transferor servicer to take action with respect to the misdirected payment \u201cpromptly.\u201d The Bureau does not agree with individual consumers who suggest that borrowers should be permitted to make payments to the transferor during the 60 days after the transfer date, or that the transferee servicer should collect payments from the transferor. While \u00a7 1024.33(c)(1) would prevent timely but misdirected payments from being treated as late, the transferor servicer's contractual right to collect payments from the borrower would likely end after a servicing transfer.", 
                        "In the final rule, the Bureau has added language to \u00a7 1024.33(c)(2)(ii) to require the transferor servicer to notify the payor of the proper recipient of payment. Although the servicing transfer notice will provide some notice to the borrower of a transfer, there may be situations in which the payor may be a different party than the borrower who received the transfer notice. In addition, the fact that the payment was sent to the transferor servicer would suggest that the transfer notice sent pursuant to \u00a7 1024.33(b) did not achieve its intended purpose. Thus, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to instruct the payor of the proper recipient of the payment and that borrowers will be better served by this requirement than by requiring the transferor to redirect the payment to the transferee."

                        "RESPA section 6(h) generally provides that a person who makes a federally related mortgage loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions of any such State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of the servicing of a loan if such person or servicer complies with the requirements under RESPA section 6 regarding timing, content, and procedures for notification of the borrower. 12 U.S.C. 2605(h). Current \u00a7 1024.21(h) implements RESPA section 6(h) and was finalized as part of a HUD's 1994 final rule implementing RESPA section 6, which was added by section 921 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Current \u00a7 1024.21(h) provides that a lender who makes a mortgage servicing loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with any State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application or transfer of servicing if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.21. The provision further states that any State law requiring notice to the borrower at application or transfer of servicing is preempted and that lenders and servicers shall have no other disclosure requirements. Finally, \u00a7 1024.21(h) provides that provisions of State law, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities, are not preempted by RESPA section 6 or \u00a7 1024.21 and that this additional information may be added to a notice provided under \u00a7 1024.33 if permitted under State law.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to move \u00a7 1024.21(h) to new \u00a7 1024.33(d), along with several non-substantive amendments. The language of the Bureau's proposed preemption provision is substantially similar to the existing preemption provision with respect to the types of provisions of State laws or regulations preempted\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> those requiring notices to the borrower at application or transfer of servicing where the servicer or lender complies with the Bureau's servicing transfer notice provisions. The Bureau notes, however, that consistent with the discussion above, the Bureau's proposal would have expanded the coverage of the preemption provision to cover subordinate-lien mortgage loans by replacing the term &#8220;mortgage servicing loan&#8221; in the current language with references to the term &#8220;mortgage loans.&#8221; The Bureau notes that expanded coverage of the preemption provision to subordinate-lien loans is consistent with the scope of statutory preemption provision in RESPA section 6(h), which applies to &#8220;person who makes a federally related mortgage loan or a servicer.&#8221; As discussed above, the term &#8220;federally related mortgage loan&#8221; includes subordinate-lien loans. 12 U.S.C. 2602(1)(A).", 
                        "The Bureau received one comment from an organization of State bank regulators that requested that the Bureau omit \u00a7 1024.33(d). The organization asserted that proposed \u00a7 1024.33(d) is broader than the statutory preemption provision in RESPA section 6(h) because the proposed rule would have invalidated State laws rather than having provided that any State requirements were fulfilled by compliance with the Federal regime. The organization explained it believes RESPA section 6(h) is sufficient to address the issue of duplicative or conflicting State laws, without promulgation of implementing regulations.", 
                        "Specifically, the organization objected to language in proposed \u00a7 1024.33(d) stating that State laws requiring notices to borrowers were preempted, \u201cand there shall be no additional borrower disclosure requirements.\u201d The commenter asserted that RESPA section 6(h) provides State notice laws are considered satisfied if the RESPA timing, content, and notice procedure requirements are met\u2014not that State laws are invalidated. The commenter asserted that RESPA section 6(h) allows State laws to apply where the or servicer has not satisfied the RESPA requirements, and that State examination processes would be hampered by an interpretation that simply invalidates State law requirements.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1024.33(d) as proposed. The Bureau has considered these objections but disagrees that the language of \u00a7 1024.33(d) as proposed is broader than the language of RESPA section 6(h) or will introduce new difficulties for State bank examiners. By adopting \u00a7 1024.33(d), the Bureau is maintaining substantially all of the language of \u00a7 1024.21(h), which was originally adopted by HUD through its final rule implementing RESPA section 6(h). By implementing RESPA section 6(h) through \u00a7 1024.33(d), the Bureau intends to maintain the current coverage of \u00a7 1024.21(h) as it has existed for many years. Accordingly, the Bureau disagrees that \u00a7 1024.33(d) will introduce any new complications into the State examination process.", 
                        "The commenter was also concerned that, by implementing RESPA section 6(h) through language similar but not identical to the statutory provision, proposed \u00a7 1024.33(d) would broaden the classes of State laws that are subject to RESPA section 6(h). The commenter focused on the omission in proposed \u00a7 1024.33(d) of the word \u201csuch\u201d from the statutory phrase \u201ccomplied with the provisions of any such State law\u201d; and the omission of the phrase limiting the scope of RESPA section 6(h) to the \u201ctiming, content, and procedures\u201d for notification to the borrower under RESPA section 6.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau disagrees with the commenter's assertion that, by eliminating \u201csuch\u201d from the statutory provision of \u201ccomplied with the provisions of any <em data-original=\"E-03\">such</em> State law&#8221; (emphasis added), the Bureau has broadened the scope of the preemption from specific State laws requiring notice to broad classes of law. Section 1024.33(d) makes clear that the State laws at issue are those requiring notice to borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing of a loan, which the Bureau believes is consistent with the types of notices identified in RESPA section 6(h). The Bureau also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that, by eliminating the statutory phrase, &#8220;regarding timing, content, and procedures for notification of the borrower&#8221; from the description of the requirements under section 6 with which a servicer must comply to trigger preemption, the Bureau has broadened the preemption provision. Section 1024.33(d) indicates that State laws and regulations are considered to be complied with if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of &#8220;this section,&#8221; which refers to the regulatory section (1024.33) containing requirements regarding timing, content, and procedures for notifying borrowers about servicing transfers. Accordingly, the omission of the phrase regarding timing, content, and procedures does not substantively alter the meaning of section 6(h) of RESPA.", 
                        "Finally, the commenter suggested there may be tension between \u00a7 1024.33(d) and \u00a7 1024.32(b), which provides that servicers can combine disclosures required by other laws or the terms of an agreement with a Federal or State regulatory agency with the disclosures required by subpart C. The Bureau does not believe these provisions are in conflict. Paragraph 33(d) applies by its terms only to notification provisions in \u00a7 1024.33. To the extent \u00a7 1024.32(b) generally provides that servicers can combine disclosures required by other laws or the terms of an agreement with a Federal or State regulatory agency with the disclosures required by subpart C, the Bureau believes that servicers would understand that the more specific rule overrides the general rule with regard to servicing transfer disclosures."

Paragraph (b)(2) continues to give the servicer the option of applying the escrow account to the new loan in specified circumstances. Accordingly, servicers shall generally refund escrow amounts to the borrower, unless the servicer applies the escrow balance to a new account, as permitted under \u00a7 1024.33(b)(2). In addition, the Bureau has added language referring to amounts remaining in an escrow account \u201cthat is within the servicer's control\u201d to replicate language appearing in the statutory provision.

The Bureau interprets RESPA section 6(g), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, as only requiring servicers to return escrow balances or credit a new account after the mortgage loan is paid off. The Bureau does not believe the Dodd-Frank Act amendment to RESPA section 6(g) was intended to affect the manner in which the loan is paid off.

To implement this provision, the Bureau proposed to add new \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) to provide that a servicer may credit funds in an escrow account balance to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan as of the date of the settlement of the new mortgage loan if the new mortgage loan is provided to the borrower by a lender that: (i) Was also the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan.\n            Thus, if the servicer credits the funds in the escrow account to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan, the credit should occur as of the settlement of the new mortgage loan. The Bureau proposed to add comment 34(b)(2)-1 to clarify that a servicer is not required to credit an escrow account balance to a new mortgage loan in any circumstance in which it would be permitted to do so.

However, several industry associations requested that the rule include an option for the borrower to direct how the escrow account funds should be applied. One industry trade association expressed concern that RESPA section 6(g) and proposed \u00a7 1024.34 contained an ambiguity regarding the ability of a servicer to transfer funds retained in the escrow account to a new lender with the borrower's consent. This commenter noted that, while neither RESPA section 6(g) nor \u00a7 1024.34 explicitly prohibits this practice, the use of the term \u201csame lender\u201d in the statute and proposed \u00a7 1024.34 creates uncertainty over whether a servicer may credit any excess escrow account balances to a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan with a <em data-original=\"E-03\">new lender</em> with the borrower's consent.",

As in the proposal, these lenders are (i) the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) the lender that is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) the lender that uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan.",

The Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 6(g) to require that servicers either return remaining escrow account balances to the borrower within 20 days or credit a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan with the \u201csame lender,\u201d which the Bureau has interpreted to be (i) the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable; (ii) the lender that is the owner or assignee of the prior mortgage loan; or (iii) the lender that uses the same servicer that serviced the prior mortgage loan to service the new mortgage loan. The Bureau believes an additional exception to permit servicers to apply remaining escrow balances to lenders who are not the \u201csame lender\u201d within the meaning of RESPA section 6(g) would subsume the statutory provision. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the provision in \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1) (generally requiring servicers to return remaining escrow balances to borrowers within 20 days of loan payoff) provides borrowers with sufficient flexibility to apply their funds as they wish.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau has revised proposed \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) to add the phrase \u201cif the borrower agrees\u201d to require servicers to obtain the borrower's consent before crediting an escrow balance to a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan. The Bureau has added this language to ensure borrowers are informed of and agree to a servicer's actions with respect to any remaining escrow balances if the servicer does not return the balance within 20 days under \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1). Moreover, unlike the 20-day period in which the servicer must otherwise refund escrow balances in \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1), \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) does not require that funds be credited within a particular time frame; the Bureau believes it is appropriate to include a requirement in \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) that the borrower agrees before the servicer takes an action that could delay the disposition of the borrower's escrow account balance. The Bureau also believes it is appropriate to include a requirement that borrowers agree to servicer actions under \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) to avoid potential borrower confusion that might otherwise arise if a servicer did not refund an escrow balance within 20 days, as required under \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1). Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the addition of the requirement that a borrower must agree under \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to achieve the purposes of RESPA section 6(g) and to ensure responsiveness to borrower requests. This change is therefore authorized under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA. The Bureau has also made technical revisions to proposed \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2) to clarify its relationship to \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1), in light of the Bureau's revision to \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1) in this final rule.\n            \n          ",

The Bureau has also added language to \u00a7 1024.34(b)(2), referring to amounts remaining in an escrow account \u201cthat is within the servicer's control,\u201d to replicate language appearing in the statutory provision. Finally, the Bureau is adopting comment 34(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed to clarify that a servicer is not required to credit funds in an escrow account to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan and may, in all circumstances, comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.34 by refunding the funds in the escrow account to the borrower pursuant to \u00a7 1024.34(b)(1).\n            \n          "

                        "Section 6(e) of RESPA requires servicers to respond to borrowers' \u201cqualified written requests\u201d that relate to the servicing of a loan, and \u00a7 6(k)(1)(B) of RESPA, added by the Dodd-Frank Act, separately prohibits servicers from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests. Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to add new servicer prohibitions regarding borrowers' assertions of error and requests for information. Specifically, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(C) to RESPA, which states that a servicer shall not \u201cfail to take timely action to respond to a borrower's requests to correct errors relating to allocation of payments, final balances for purposes of paying off the loan, or avoiding foreclosure, or other standard servicer's duties.\u201d In addition, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(D) to RESPA which states that a servicer shall not fail to provide information regarding the owner or assignee of a borrower's loan within ten business days of a borrower's request. Neither Dodd-Frank Act provision suggests that a borrower request to correct an error or for information regarding the owner or assignee of the borrower's loan must be in the form of a \u201cqualified written request\u201d to trigger the new servicer prohibitions.", 
                        "As explained in the proposal, the Bureau believed that both borrowers and servicers would be best served if the Bureau were to clearly define a servicer's obligation to correct errors or respond to information requests as required by RESPA sections 6(k)(1)(C) and (D) and the RESPA provisions regarding qualified written requests. Thus, the Bureau proposed to establish comprehensive, parallel requirements for servicers to respond to specified notices of error and information requests. The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35 to set forth the error resolution requirements that servicers would be required to follow to respond to errors asserted by borrowers. The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.36 to set forth the information request requirements that servicers would be required to follow to respond to requests for information from borrowers. In doing so, the Bureau intended to establish servicer procedural requirements for error resolution and information requests that are consistent with the requirements applicable to a \u201cqualified written request\u201d that relates to the servicing of a loan under RESPA. Rather than create overlapping regimes that might confuse and frustrate both borrowers and servicers alike, the Bureau intended to create a uniform regulatory regime by subsuming the qualified written request rules in the new regime established and authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act for notices of error and requests for information more generally. The Bureau believed such a single regulatory regime would reduce the burden on both borrowers and servicers who otherwise would expend wasteful resources navigating between two separate regulatory regimes and parsing form requirements applicable to qualified written requests. To that end, the Bureau proposed to delete current \u00a7 1024.21(e), the existing regulations concerning qualified written requests, and provide instead that a qualified written request asserting an error or requesting information regarding the servicing of a mortgage loan would be subject to the new provisions governing notices of error and information requests, as applicable.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Because the Bureau understands that the majority of borrower complaints are submitted orally, the Bureau proposed that both written and oral notices of error would be subject to the error resolution provisions. At the same time, the Bureau recognized that permitting oral error notices would significantly expand servicers' responsibility to respond to notices of error. To enable servicers to allocate resources to respond to errors in a manner that would benefit borrowers, the Bureau proposed a limited list of errors to which the error resolution provisions would apply. As discussed in more detail below, industry commenters were unanimously opposed to applying error resolution requirements under proposed \u00a7 1024.35 to errors asserted orally. Consumer advocacy group commenters expressed support for applying the requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 to oral error notices, but were strongly opposed to the proposal to limit those errors subject to error resolution procedures under proposed \u00a7 1024.35 to a finite list. Industry commenters supported inclusion of a limited list. Based on the Bureau's consideration of these comments and the analysis below, the final rule does not require servicers to comply with error resolution procedures under \u00a7 1024.35 for oral notices of error. At the same time, the final rule includes a catch-all provision that defines as an error subject to the error resolution procedures under \u00a7 1024.35 errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. Moreover, the final rule provides that a servicer's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to provide information to borrowers who are not satisfied with the resolution of a complaint or request for information submitted orally of the procedures for submitting written notices of error and information requests.", 
                        "Some credit unions, community banks and their trade associations asserted that the Bureau should exempt small servicers from error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 and information request requirements under \u00a7 1024.36. Commenters argued that small servicers effectively communicate with borrowers regarding complaints and information requests, and especially disfavored the proposed requirement that small servicers respond to oral notices of error and information requests. In contrast, a consumer advocacy group commenter asserted that exempting small servicers would be inappropriate, as all servicers should be capable of complying with error resolution and information request requirements. Having carefully considered these comments, the Bureau declines to exempt small servicers from error resolution procedures under \u00a7 1024.35 and information request procedures under \u00a7 1024.36. As discussed above, \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36, as finalized, do not require servicers to comply with such procedures for oral submissions by borrowers. In light of this adjustment, final \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 primarily provide clarification as to existing obligations under RESPA and Regulation X. Moreover, the burden on all servicers is significantly mitigated. For these reasons, and the reasons discussed below, the Bureau declines to exempt small servicers from error resolution and information request procedures."

The Bureau intended to propose servicer obligations applicable to qualified written requests that were the same as requirements applicable to other notices of error that met the requirements for assertions of error under \u00a7 1024.35(a). One consumer group commenter expressed support for the proposal because it dispensed with technicalities about whether an assertion of error constituted a valid qualified written request. A trade association commenter said the Bureau failed to define a valid qualified written request and said that proposed \u00a7 1024.35 does not fully integrate section 6(e) of RESPA into the proposed error resolution procedures. Another trade association of private mortgage lenders said the proposal did not make clear what constitutes a qualified written request and to what extent servicers must continue to comply with existing law regarding qualified written requests. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final \u00a7 1024.31 defines the term \u201cqualified written request.\u201d In addition, as discussed above, the Bureau has added new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2, which clarifies that the error resolution and information request requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request.

The Bureau believed this approach was warranted because, based on its discussions with consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and industry trade associations during outreach, the Bureau learned that the vast majority of borrower complaints are asserted orally rather than in writing. The proposal solicited comment regarding whether servicers should be required to comply with the error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 for notices of error received orally.", 
                                "The Bureau received a number of comments from both consumer groups and various industry members on this question. Consumer advocacy group commenters reiterated their support for applying the requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 to notices of error made orally, noting that consumers most often assert errors and request information orally rather than in writing. In contrast, consumer commenters on Regulation Room disfavored the proposal's application of the error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 to notices of error received orally. Consumer commenters, citing their negative experiences attempting to request information from servicers orally, were concerned that encouraging an oral process would weaken consumer protections. Industry commenters also opposed the proposal's application of the error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 to oral notices of error, albeit for different reasons. Industry commenters asserted that applying error resolution requirements to oral notices of error would create new burdens for servicers regarding tracking the notices of error and monitoring borrowers' receipt of written acknowledgements and responses. Industry commenters further stressed that a written process would provide more clarity and certainty as to the nature of the error the borrower asserted and the communications from the servicer to the borrower during the conversation. Further, industry commenters asserted, written notices of error would help avoid situations in which the borrower and servicer have differing recollections as to the content of the borrower's notice of error and the servicer's response during the conversation. Absent a written record, commenters said, servicers would need to record conversations with borrowers to minimize the significant litigation risk. The commenters asserted that recording conversations could be especially costly for small servicers and would require the borrower's consent in many jurisdictions. Some industry commenters also noted their belief that RESPA requires that borrowers assert errors in writing.", 
                                "Many of the concerns articulated by industry commenters were consistent with those expressed by small entity representatives with whom the Small Business Review Panel conducted outreach in advance of the proposal. The Small Business Review Panel recommended that the Bureau consider requiring small servicers to comply with the error resolution procedures under \u00a7 1024.35 only when borrowers asserted errors in writing.\n            The Small Business Review Panel also recommended that the Bureau consider adopting a more flexible process for tracking errors and demonstrating compliance that could be used by small servicers.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau had anticipated many of these comments and had proposed to delimit the category of issues that could be raised through the error process to mitigate the challenges of identifying oral assertions of error. Nonetheless, after consideration of these comments and the comments received with respect to the Bureau's definition of error as discussed below, the Bureau is amending proposed \u00a7 1024.35(a) to apply the error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 solely to notices of error received in writing, and the Bureau is broadening the definition of error as well. While borrowers may continue to assert errors orally, servicers will not be required to comply with the formal error resolution requirements outlined in \u00a7 1024.35 for such assertions of errors. Instead, the Bureau has added \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1)(ii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can investigate, respond to, and, as appropriate, make corrections in response to complaints, whether written or oral, asserted by borrowers. In addition, the Bureau has added a requirement in \u00a7 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers of the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in \u00a7 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in \u00a7 1024.36.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that imposing the formal requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 only to written notices of error and addressing oral notices of error instead through the policies and procedures requirements under \u00a7 1024.38 strikes the appropriate balance between ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints and mitigating the burden on servicers of following and demonstrating compliance with specific procedures with respect to oral notices of error. The Bureau believes that the need to provide additional flexibility to servicers with respect to responding to oral notices of error is particularly necessary in light of the Bureau's further decision, as discussed below, to expand the list of covered errors under \u00a7 1024.35 to include a catch-all provision for errors relating to the servicing of mortgage loans. On the one hand, the Bureau is persuaded, for the reasons discussed further below, that it should not delimit the set of issues that consumers should be able to raise within the error resolution process. On the other hand, the Bureau also is persuaded that determining from a telephone call from a borrower to a servicer whether the borrower is asserting an error rather than simply, for example, posing a question can be challenging. Drawing this line\u2014and triggering the investigation and response requirement with respect to errors\u2014would be exponentially more difficult if any concern relating to the servicing of the borrower's mortgage loan could constitute an error.", 
                                "The final rule will thus require servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers investigate, respond to and, as appropriate, resolve oral complaints on a more informal basis, without having to follow the formal error resolution requirements, so long as the servicer has policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that borrowers are informed of the written error resolution procedures. At the same time, the final rule will provide a broader definition of errors subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.35."

Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat a notice of error as having been submitted by the borrower.

The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints, to apply this requirement to all written notices of error, especially since borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or in dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau declines to define further the term \u201cagent.\u201d The concept of agency has historically been defined under State or other applicable law.

Proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b) set forth a limited list of errors to which the error resolution provisions would apply. The Bureau proposed a limited list because it believed such a list would provide certainty to both borrowers and servicers regarding the types of errors that are subject to the error resolution process. Further, as discussed above, the Bureau believed a limited list would enable servicers to allocate resources to respond to errors in a manner that would ultimately benefit borrowers. The Bureau also considered that it was proposing to require servicers to respond to both oral and written error notices and information requests in compressed time periods. Finally, the Bureau considered the feedback the Small Business Review Panel received from small entity representatives regarding whether the error resolution procedures should include a catch-all provision to the enumerated list of errors. In general, small entity representatives commented favorably on the Bureau's proposal to delimit the list of errors.", 
                                "The Bureau solicited comment regarding whether the list of errors to which error resolution procedures would apply should include a catch-all provision or be limited to an enumerated list. Industry commenters supported the establishment of a limited list of errors, noting certainty, clarity, and notice as its primary benefits. Consumer group commenters generally opposed limiting notices of error to an enumerated list. Consumer advocates asserted that the proposal was a departure from and offered fewer consumer protections than the existing qualified written request process under section 6 of RESPA, which incorporates a catch-all provision for errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. Some consumer advocates noted the reference in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA to \u201cstandard servicer's duties,\u201d and argued that the catch-all provision should likewise cover all errors relating to \u201cstandard servicer's duties.\u201d In addition, some consumer group commenters noted the fluid nature of mortgage servicing and cautioned that a limited list of covered errors lacks the flexibility necessary to ensure that consumers will be adequately protected as servicing practices evolve.", 
                                "After consideration of these comments, and as discussed further below, the Bureau has decided to revise proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b) to include a catch-all that includes as an error errors relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan. In addition, as discussed below, final \u00a7 1024.35(b) substantively retains the enumerated errors listed in the proposal. The Bureau believes revising proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b) in this manner is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints in light of the fluidity of the mortgage market and the inability to anticipate in advance and delineate all types of errors related to servicing that borrowers may encounter, and which should be subject to the error resolution process under \u00a7 1024.35 to prevent borrower harm. At the same time, the Bureau believes that the costs and burdens created by having a more expansive definition of the term error are significantly mitigated because, as discussed above, the final rule applies error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 only to written assertions of error. Moreover, the final rule implements an error resolution process that is consistent with the existing process for responding to qualified written requests under RESPA section 6, which includes a catch-all for servicing-related errors."

Some consumer group commenters objected that the proposed exclusions were overly broad. The Bureau believes that a mortgage servicer is generally not in a position to investigate or resolve borrower complaints regarding potential errors that may have occurred during an origination, underwriting, sale, or securitization process. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 35(b)-1 substantially as proposed. The final comment clarifies that, in addition to \u00a7 1024.35(d) and (e), servicers need not comply with \u00a7 1024.35(i) with respect to a borrower's assertion of an error that is not defined as an error in \u00a7 1024.35(b). Final comment 35(b)-1 also includes a clarification that the failure to transfer accurately and timely information relating to a borrower's loan account to a transferee servicer is an error for purposes of \u00a7 1024.35, while matters relating to an initial determination to transfer servicing are not.", 
                                "A trade association of reverse mortgage lenders also commented regarding the scope of the error resolution procedures, urging the Bureau to exclude reverse mortgages from the scope of covered error. Having considered this comment, the Bureau notes that servicers of reverse mortgage transactions are already subject to the qualified written request procedures set forth in section 6(e) of RESPA and \u00a7 1024.21(e) of Regulation X. Likewise, pursuant to final \u00a7 1024.30, the error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 apply to reverse mortgage transactions that are mortgage loans, as that term is defined in final \u00a7 1024.31. Accordingly, to the extent that a borrower asserts an error under \u00a7 1024.35 that is applicable to such a reverse mortgage, the servicer shall comply with error resolution procedures as to the error. For example, because \u00a7 1024.30 generally excludes servicers of reverse mortgage transactions from \u00a7 1024.41, errors asserted under \u00a7 1024.35(b)(9) and (10), discussed below, are not applicable to reverse mortgage transactions."

The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b)(3) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to the allocation of payments for a borrower's account and other standard servicer duties. A failure to credit a payment as of the date of receipt may have implications for the correct application of borrower payments. A servicer's failure to credit a payment promptly may cause the servicer to report to a borrower improper information regarding the amounts owed by the borrower and may cause a servicer to misapply other payments received by the borrower. Further, a servicer's failure to credit borrower payments promptly may generate improper late fees and other charges. The Bureau further believes that prompt crediting of borrower payments is a standard servicer duty as set forth in section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA. The Bureau also observes that prompt crediting of borrower payments is, by definition, servicing and, therefore, is subject to the qualified written request procedure set forth in section 6(e) of RESPA.", 
                        "As the Bureau noted in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, prompt crediting of payments to consumers is required by section 129F of TILA, which was added by section 1464 of the Dodd-Frank Act and will be implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(c)(1) in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. For a mortgage loan secured by a principal dwelling, TILA section 129F mandates that servicers shall not fail to credit a payment to a consumer's loan account as of the date of receipt, except when a delay in crediting does not result in any charge to the consumer, or in the furnishing of negative information to a consumer reporting agency. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1639f. TILA section 129F provides a specific exception for payments that do not conform to a servicer's written requirements, but nonetheless are accepted by the servicer, in which case the servicer shall credit the payment as of five days after receipt. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1639f(b). Servicers of mortgage loans covered by TILA section 129F have a duty to comply with that provision.", 
                        "A credit union and a non-bank servicer commented on proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b)(3). The credit union requested greater flexibility as to payments received outside of the servicer's operating hours or at the end of the business day. The non-bank servicing company requested clarification that the proposal was not intended to impact servicers' ability as to scheduled interest loans to credit an account as of the receipt date and apply payment as of the scheduled due date. The Bureau believes \u00a7 1024.35(b)(3) as proposed would have provided servicers sufficient flexibility to credit payments, as it would have limited errors to where the failure to credit a payment as of the date of receipt results in a charge to consumers or furnishing of negative information to a credit reporting agency. Nevertheless, the Bureau recognizes that there would be little consumer benefit to subjecting servicers to potentially overlapping standards as to prompt crediting of borrowers' accounts. At the same time, for those loans that are not subject to TILA section 129F, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to extend the requirements of that provision beyond the scope mandated by Congress, as implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(c)(1) of the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the proposed language in final \u00a7 1024.35(b)(3) to make clear that a servicer's failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt is an error only in those circumstances in which the failure to credit as of the date of receipt would contravene \u00a7 1026.36(c)(1). Final \u00a7 1024.35(b)(3) defines as an error the failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt in violation of 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(1). Because servicers will already be required to comply with \u00a7 1026.36(c)(1) with respect to certain mortgage loans they service, the Bureau does not believe that defining their failure to do so as an error imposes additional burden on servicers."

Servicers are required to make disbursements from escrow accounts in a timely manner pursuant to section 6(g) of RESPA and are required to account for the funds credited to an escrow account pursuant to section 10 of RESPA.

The Bureau intended through this provision to implement TILA section 129G, which was added by section 1464 of the Dodd-Frank Act and which requires that a creditor or servicer of a home loan send an accurate payoff balance amount to the borrower within a reasonable time, but in no case more than seven business days after the receipt of a written request for such balance from or on behalf of a borrower. The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35(b)(6) to implement, in part, section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA with respect to borrower requests to correct errors relating to a final balance for purposes of paying off a mortgage loan and standard servicer duties.",

A payoff statement is necessary any time a borrower repays a mortgage loan, and servicers routinely provide payoff statements for borrowers to refinance or pay in full their mortgage loan obligations. However, consumer advocates have indicated that servicers have failed, or refused, to provide payoff statements to certain borrowers or have required borrowers to make a payment on a mortgage loan as a condition of fulfilling the borrower's request for a payoff statement.\n            Any such conduct has the perverse effect of impeding a borrower's ability to pay a mortgage loan obligation in full.",

The Bureau recognizes that there would be little consumer benefit to subjecting servicers to potentially overlapping standards under TILA and RESPA as to the provision of a payoff statement. At the same time, for those loans that are not subject to TILA section 129G, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to extend the requirements of the provision beyond the scope mandated by Congress, as implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(c)(3).",

In the normal course of business, servicers typically anticipate that they will be required to transfer servicing for some mortgage loans they service. Owners or assignees of mortgage loans typically have rights to transfer servicing for a mortgage loan pursuant to the requirements set forth in mortgage servicing agreements. Servicers generally are required to develop capacity for transferring information to transferee servicers in order to comply with such obligations to owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, servicers generally are required to develop capacity to download data for transferred mortgage loans onto the servicer's servicing platform.

Both consumer groups and industry commented regarding whether to include a servicer's failure to correctly evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option as an error. One consumer group urged the Bureau to do so, asserting that because the Dodd-Frank Act requires servicers to take timely action to correct errors relating to avoiding foreclosure, the plain language of the statute suggests that borrowers should be able to assert errors related to loss mitigation before they get to the point of a foreclosure sale. The commenter further contended that the appeals process set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.41(h) will not hold servicers sufficiently accountable for uncorrected errors. The commenter said that borrowers need a statutory remedy for uncorrected errors. Another consumer group advocated for a catch-all sufficiently broad to capture the array of servicer loss mitigation duties. An industry association took the opposing view, citing concerns about the inability to objectively measure whether a servicer evaluated a borrower for an option correctly. The industry commenter requested that should the Bureau add this category as a covered error, the Bureau also clarify that a servicer who complies with \u00a7 1024.41 has not committed the error.",

The Bureau believes that any error related to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan also relates to standard servicer duties. The Bureau also agrees with consumer advocacy commenters that the mortgage market is fluid and constantly changing and that it is impossible to anticipate with certainty the precise nature of the issues that borrowers will encounter. The Bureau, therefore, believes that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to craft error resolution procedures that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to changes in the mortgage market and to encompass the myriad and diverse types of errors that borrowers may encounter with respect to their mortgage loans. At the same time, the Bureau believes the costs and burdens created by having a more expansive definition of error are significantly mitigated because, as discussed above, under the final rule the requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 apply only to written notices of error. Moreover, the final rule adopts a process that is consistent with the existing process for responding to qualified written requests under RESPA section 6, which likewise includes a catch-all for servicing-related errors.

Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 35(c)-4 as proposed, with minor technical amendments, and the Bureau has removed references to error notices received by telephone."

                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35(c), which would have permitted a servicer to establish an exclusive telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error. If a servicer chose to establish a separate telephone number and address for receiving errors, the proposal would have required the servicer to provide the borrower a notice that states that the borrower may assert an error at the telephone number and address established by the servicer for that purpose. Proposed comment 35(c)-1 would have clarified that if a servicer has not designated a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error, then the servicer will be required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error received by any office of the servicer. Proposed comment 35(c)-2 would have further clarified that the written notice to the borrower may be set forth in another written notice provided to the borrower, such as a notice of transfer, periodic statement, or coupon book. Proposed comment 35(c)-2 would have further clarified that if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address for receipt of notices of error, the servicer must provide that telephone number and address in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to allow servicers to establish a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to assert an error in order to allow servicers to direct oral and written errors to appropriate personnel that have been trained to ensure that the servicer responds appropriately. As the proposal noted, at larger servicers with other consumer financial service affiliates, many personnel simply do not typically deal with mortgage servicing-related issues. For instance, at a major bank servicer, a borrower might assert an error to local bank branch staff, who likely would not have access to the information necessary to address their error. Thus, the Bureau reasoned, if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address that a borrower must use, a servicer would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements for errors that may be received by the servicer through a different method.", 
                        "Most industry commenters favored allowing servicers to designate an address and telephone number to which borrowers must direct error notices. At the same time, such commenters asserted that creating an exclusive intake portal was not sufficient to offset the burdens inherent in permitting oral error notices to which error resolution requirements apply. Some commenters said that designating telephone lines for error notices could be especially costly for small servicers. Thus, one community bank trade association argued that the proposal favored large institutions. Two industry commenters requested clarification regarding how servicers must treat error notices sent to the wrong address. Finally, one credit union commenter asserted that servicers should only be required to include designated telephone numbers and addresses in regular forms of communication to borrowers, such as the periodic statement. In contrast, consumer group commenters suggested that to the extent a servicer designates a telephone line or address, the servicer should be required to post such information on its Web site and to include it in mailed notices.", 
                        "Because the final rule removes the requirement that servicers comply with error resolution requirements under \u00a7 1024.35 for oral notices of error, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to regulate the circumstances under which servicers may direct oral errors to an exclusive telephone number that a borrower must use to assert an error. However, for written error notices, the Bureau continues to believe that it is reasonable to permit servicers to designate a specific address for the intake of notices of error. Allowing a servicer to designate a specific address is consistent with current requirements of Regulation X with respect to qualified written requests. Current \u00a7 1024.21(e)(1) permits a servicer to designate a \u201cseparate and exclusive office and address for the receipt and handling of qualified written requests.\u201d Moreover, the Bureau believes that identifying a specific address for receiving errors and information requests will benefit consumers. By providing a specific address, servicers will identify to consumers the office capable of addressing errors identified by consumers.", 
                        "The Bureau believes it is critical for servicers to publicize any designated address to ensure that borrowers know how properly to assert an error and to avoid evasion by servicers of error resolution procedures. This is especially important because, as noted in the proposal, servicers who designate a specific address for receipt of error notices are not required to comply with error resolution procedures for notices sent to the wrong address. Accordingly, final \u00a7 1024.35(c) requires servicers that designate an address for receipt of notices of error to post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the Web site lists any contact address for the servicer. In addition, final comment 35(c)-2 retains the clarification that servicers that establish an address that a borrower must use to assert an error, must provide the address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance. The Bureau is otherwise adopting \u00a7 1024.35(c) and comments 35(c)-1 and 35(c)-2 as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provisions permitting servicers to designate a telephone number that a borrower must use to assert an error and clarified that the notice to the borrower must be written."

                        "Industry commenters, including multiple credit union associations, requested that the Bureau lengthen the acknowledgment time period, asserting that five days is unreasonable, especially for smaller institutions. A nonprofit mortgage servicer said the timeframe is insufficient for its small volunteer staff. An industry trade association commenter argued that the acknowledgment requirement creates unnecessary paperwork and should be removed from the final rule altogether. In contrast, consumer group commenters were generally supportive of the acknowledgment requirement, noting that the timeline in the proposal was consistent with that in the Dodd-Frank Act for qualified written requests.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that acknowledgment within five days is appropriate given that the Dodd-Frank Act expressly adopts that requirement for qualified written requests and differentiating between the two regimes would increase operational complexity. Moreover, the burden on servicers is significantly mitigated by the fact that the error resolution procedures are only applicable to written notices of error. The Bureau further notes that the contents of the acknowledgment are minimal. In addition, servicers need not provide an acknowledgment if the servicer corrects the error identified by the borrower and notifies the borrower of that correction in writing within five days of receiving the error notice. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.35(d) substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provision to clarify that the acknowledgment must be written."

As discussed further below, the proposal would have required servicers to respond to errors relating to payoff balances within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error.

Notices of errors identified in \u00a7 1024.35(b)(9) and (10), which focus on the failure to suspend a foreclosure sale in the circumstances described in \u00a7 1024.41(f), (g), or (j), implicate this concern. Numerous entities, including other federal agencies and small entity representatives during the Small Business Review Panel outreach, expressed concern about borrower use of error resolution requirements as a procedural tool to impede proper foreclosures and promote litigation.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Industry commenters reiterated concerns heard during pre-proposal outreach that borrowers could use the error resolution requirements to halt foreclosure sales, including minutes before a foreclosure sale. One industry commenter stressed that in some circumstances, whether to proceed with foreclosure will be beyond the servicer's control, as some courts will not cancel foreclosure after a certain date and Freddie Mac can override a servicer's request to postpone or cancel a sale. Thus, two commenters urged the Bureau to exempt from liability servicers required by an investor, insurer, guarantor or legal requirement to proceed with a foreclosure sale. Another industry commenter requested an exception for those borrowers who have had their claims heard by a court, asserting that servicers need finality and that extending foreclosure timelines is costly. In contrast, consumer group commenters opposed the alternative compliance option for errors asserted within seven days of a foreclosure sale. Consumer groups asserted that servicers should be required to communicate with borrowers in writing. In addition, some consumer group commenters reasoned that because proposed \u00a7 1024.35(f)(2) would exempt the servicer from the requirement to conduct an investigation or provide the borrower with the documents relied upon in reaching its determination that no error occurred, it would effectively permit servicers to ignore valid requests for postponement so long as the servicer sends a letter stating that no error occurred.",

As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that reducing the procedural requirements for servicers to follow for such notices mitigates the concern that borrowers may use error resolution procedures to impede foreclosure, while maintaining protection for consumers. The Bureau believes that this alternative compliance method is also consistent with the Small Business Review Panel recommendation that the Bureau provide flexibility to small servicers and responds to small entity representatives' concern that error resolution procedures may be used in unwarranted litigation. Further, the Bureau understands the timing to be consistent with the GSE requirement that servicers conduct account reviews to document that all required actions have occurred at least seven days prior to a foreclosure sale. The Bureau declines to revise the proposal to require that servicers communicate with borrowers in writing, as the Bureau believes servicers require flexibility in communicating with borrowers close in time to a foreclosure sale."

If the information was reviewed by the servicer, then such information is not new and requiring a servicer to re-open an investigation will create unwarranted burden and delay. Second, even if the information is new, it must be material to the asserted error.

Another consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to require servicers to inform borrowers that servicers will reconsider a duplicative error notice to the extent that the borrower is able to more concisely describe an alleged error. Another commenter asserted that the proposed exclusion shields servicers from the consequences of incompletely addressing a notice of error the first time it is received. Finally, an anonymous commenter questioned the Bureau's authority to create the exclusion altogether.", 
                        "Having considered these comments, the Bureau believes that \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(i), as proposed, strikes the appropriate balance in that it requires servicers to respond to duplicative error notices only to the extent that such notices present new and material information. The Bureau recognizes that borrowers will assert errors in lay terms, and this section is not intended to require any particular level of specificity in the errors that borrowers assert. All that this section provides is that if a borrower submits a second error claim that the servicer reasonably determines is substantially the same as a previous submission, the servicer is not obligated to go back through the investigative process unless the borrower has presented new and material information. Thus, to the extent that a borrower initially lacks sufficient information to articulate clearly an alleged error but is later privy to new and material information that enables the borrower to describe the error more clearly, proposed \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(i) requires a servicer to reconsider new and material information subsequently put forward by the borrower. Thus, for the reasons outlined in the proposal and set forth above, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(i) and comment 35(g)(1)(i)-1 as proposed, with minor technical amendments.",

The proposed rule would have further clarified that if a servicer can identify a proper assertion of a covered error in a notice of error that is otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome, a servicer is required to respond to the covered error submissions it can identify.

Servicers and servicing industry representatives indicated that these types of qualified written requests are unreasonable and unduly burdensome. Small entity representatives in the Small Business Review Panel outreach requested that the Bureau consider an exclusion for abusive requests, or requests made with the intent to harass the servicer.",

Industry commenters supported the exclusion, but urged the Bureau to remove the requirement that servicers identify valid assertions of error in submissions that are otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome. Industry commenters said servicers should not be required to parse through such submissions to locate a clear assertion of error. One large trade association of mortgage servicers said that the requirement effectively subsumes the exclusion. Consumer group commenters generally disfavored the exclusion. One commenter questioned the assertion that borrowers primarily use qualified written requests to obtain prelitigation discovery. One consumer group said the exclusion gives servicers too much discretion. Another said it requires borrowers to state the basis for their alleged error with too much specificity. An anonymous consumer advocate said a request from a single borrower should not be so voluminous as to be burdensome for servicers to respond. Another consumer group commenter requested that the Bureau address situations in which the servicer erroneously determines that a submission is overbroad or unduly burdensome. Finally, one consumer group commenter said the proposed exclusion for unduly burdensome notices of error leaves borrowers unprotected as to errors that are especially egregious or complex.", 
                        "In proposing \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(ii), the Bureau did not intend to frustrate consumers' ability to assert actual complex errors and to have such errors investigated and corrected, as appropriate, by servicers. The Bureau believes it is critical that consumers have a mechanism by which to have complex errors addressed. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised proposed \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(ii) and proposed comment 35(g)(1)(ii)-1 to remove references to unduly burdensome notices of error. At the same time, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(ii), in part, because the Bureau believes that requiring servicers to respond to overbroad notices of error from some borrowers may cause servicers to expend fewer resources to address other errors that may be more clearly stated and more clearly require servicer attention. As discussed above, the Bureau expands the definition of errors subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.35 to contain a catch-all for all errors relating to the servicing of the borrower's loan. Given the breadth of the errors subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.35, the Bureau continues to believe that a requirement for servicers to respond to notices of error that are overbroad may harm consumers and frustrate servicers' ability to comply with the new error resolution requirements. The Bureau does not believe that the error resolution procedures are the appropriate forum for borrowers to prosecute wide-ranging complaints against mortgage servicers that are more appropriate for resolution through litigation. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.35(g)(1)(ii) and comment 35(g)(1)(ii)-1 substantially as proposed, except that the Bureau has revised the provisions to remove references to unduly burdensome notices of error."

Proposed comment 35(h)-1 would have clarified that \u00a7 1024.35(h) does not alter or otherwise affect a borrower's obligation to make payments owed pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan. The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.35(h) for three reasons. First, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(B) to RESPA, which prohibits a servicer from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests. Proposed \u00a7 1024.35(h) would implement that provision with respect to qualified written requests. Second, the Bureau believes that a servicer's practice of charging for responding to a notice of error impedes borrowers from pursuing valid notices of error and that the prohibition is therefore necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints. Third, the Bureau understands that, in some instances, servicer personnel have demanded that borrowers make payments before the servicer will correct errors or provide information requested by a borrower. The Bureau believes that a servicer should be required to correct errors notwithstanding the payment status of a borrower's account.

                                "Industry commenters strongly objected to the 60-day reporting prohibition. Commenters said the proposal undermines the accuracy and integrity of credit reports. One commenter said the Fair Credit Reporting Act already governs credit reporting. One large bank commenter asserted that because credit reporting is a safety and soundness protection, banks have a duty to accurately report delinquencies. Several industry commenters also noted a concern that, based on prior experience, borrowers may use the reporting prohibition to manipulate the system by disputing legitimate delinquencies in order to apply for credit without derogatory marks on credit reports. The Bureau acknowledges the concerns expressed but notes that Congress specifically imposed the 60-day reporting prohibition with respect to qualified written requests in section 6(e) of RESPA. As discussed above, the Bureau believes it is necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to ensure responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints and the provision of accurate and relevant information to borrowers, to apply the same procedures to all notices of error as applicable to qualified written requests. Otherwise, borrowers and servicers must expend wasteful resources parsing the form requirements applicable to qualified written requests and navigating between two separate regulatory regimes. As detailed above, the Bureau believes that the interests of borrowers and servicers are best served and the purposes of RESPA are best met through a single regulatory regime applicable to both qualified written requests and other notices of error. The Bureau is therefore adopting \u00a7 1024.35(i)(1) as proposed, as it is consistent with the 60-day reporting prohibition for qualified written requests required by section 6(e) of RESPA."

                                "Similar to the proposed requirements for notices of error, proposed \u00a7 1024.36(a) would have required a servicer to treat a qualified written request that requests information relating to the servicing of a loan as an information request subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.36. The Bureau intended to propose servicer obligations applicable to qualified written requests that were the same as requirements applicable to information requests under \u00a7 1024.36(a). One consumer group commenter expressed support for the proposal because it dispensed with technicalities about whether an information request constituted a valid qualified written request. One trade association commenter said the Bureau failed to define a valid qualified written request and said that proposed \u00a7 1024.36 does not fully integrate section 6(e) of RESPA into the proposed information request procedures. Another trade association of private mortgage lenders said the proposal did not make clear what constitutes a qualified written request and to what extent servicers must continue to comply with existing law regarding qualified written requests. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final \u00a7 1024.31 defines the term \u201cqualified written request.\u201d In addition, as discussed above, the Bureau has added new comment 31 (qualified written request)-2, which clarifies that the error resolution and information request requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request. Finally, the Bureau has revised proposed \u00a7 1024.36(a) to make clear in the final rule that a qualified written request that requests information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan is a request for information for purposes of \u00a7 1024.36 for which a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a request for information."

The Bureau believed this approach was warranted, in part, because discussions with consumers, consumer advocates, servicers, and industry trade associations during outreach suggested that the vast majority of borrowers orally request information from servicers.", 
                                "As was the case for notices of error, the Bureau believed that a requirement that an information request be in writing would serve as a barrier that could unduly restrict the ability of borrowers to have errors resolved and requests fulfilled. At the same time, the Bureau recognized the burdens on servicers to ensure compliance with the proposed rule with respect to oral information requests. The Bureau believed that elements of the proposed rule would assist in mitigating servicer burden. For example, the Bureau considered that the proposal allowed servicers to designate a specific telephone number for receiving oral information requests and included an alternative compliance provision that allows a servicer to provide information orally if the information is provided within five days of the borrower's request.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau learned from pre-proposal discussions with servicers, including the small entity representatives in the Small Business Review Panel outreach, that most information requests are responded to by servicers either on the same telephone call with the borrower or within an hour of a borrower's communication. The Bureau believed that allowing servicers to respond to information requests orally would significantly reduce the burden associated with the proposed information request requirements on servicers. Further, the Bureau believed that this requirement provided flexibility for small servicers consistent with the recommendations of the Small Business Review Panel and mitigates concerns by the small entity representatives regarding compliance costs.", 
                                "The Bureau solicited comment regarding whether servicers should be required to comply with information request procedures for information requests asserted orally. The Bureau received a number of comments from both consumer groups and various industry members. Consumer group commenters reiterated their support for applying the information request provisions to requests made orally, noting that consumers most often request information orally rather than in writing. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room disfavored the proposal's application of the information request procedures under \u00a7 1024.36 to information requests received orally. Consumer commenters, citing their negative experiences attempting to request information from servicers orally, were concerned that encouraging an oral process would weaken consumer protections. Industry commenters also opposed the proposal's application of the information request requirements to oral information requests. Commenters said doing so would create new burdens for servicers regarding tracking the information requests and monitoring that a borrower receives written acknowledgements and responses. Industry commenters further stressed that a written process would provide more clarity and certainty as to the nature of the request and what the servicer communicated to the borrower during the conversation. Further, industry commenters asserted, requiring written information requests would help avoid situations in which the borrower and servicer have differing recollections as to the borrower's request and the servicer's response during the conversation. Absent a written record, commenters said, servicers would need to record conversations with borrowers to minimize the significant litigation risk. The commenters asserted that recording conversations could be especially costly for small servicers and would require the borrower's consent in many jurisdictions.", 
                                "After consideration of these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed \u00a7 1024.36(a) to require servicers to comply with \u00a7 1024.36 solely with respect to written requests for information. While borrowers may continue to raise information requests orally, servicers will not be required to comply with the formal requirements outlined in \u00a7 1024.36 for such requests. Instead, the Bureau has added to the final rule \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1)(iii), which generally requires that servicers maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that servicers provide borrowers with accurate and timely information and documents in response to borrowers' requests for information. In addition, the Bureau has added a requirement in \u00a7 1024.38(b)(5) that servicers establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers about the availability of procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in \u00a7 1024.35 and written information requests set forth in \u00a7 1024.36.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement under proposed \u00a7 1024.36(a) for servicers to comply with the requirements under \u00a7 1024.36 with respect to oral requests for information from borrowers and instead requiring servicers to develop policies and procedures to ensure responsiveness to such oral requests and inform borrowers about the availability of the written process, strikes the appropriate balance between providing prompt responses to borrower requests and mitigating servicer burden. The final rule will thus require servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to assure that the servicers respond to oral information requests on a more informal basis, without having to comply with all of the required steps for a formal information request under \u00a7 1024.36. As discussed more fully below, because only written information requests will be subject to the procedures outlined in \u00a7 1024.36, the Bureau believes it is logical and appropriate to require servicers to respond to such written requests in writing."

                                "Having considered these comments, the Bureau is amending proposed comment 36(a)-1 to address servicers' concerns about potential liability for the improper release of information. The final comment clarifies that servicers may have reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that purported agents provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat a request for information as having been submitted by the borrower. The Bureau acknowledges that requiring servicers to respond to information requests submitted by borrowers' agents is more costly than limiting the requirement to borrowers' requests, but notes that this approach is consistent with section 6(e)(1)(A) of RESPA with respect to a qualified written request. The Bureau finds that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints, to apply this requirement to all written information requests, especially since borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau declines to further define the term \u201cagent.\u201d The concept of agency has historically been defined in State and other applicable law. Thus, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable State law regarding agents."

The commenter also urged the Bureau not to require that servicers produce the servicing file in response to a borrower's information request. The commenter said that such information will be of limited utility to borrowers and often reflects privileged communications. Having considered these comments, the Bureau notes that final \u00a7 1024.36, like the proposal, has mechanisms in place to limit abuse and to protect confidential communications. Specifically, as discussed more fully below, \u00a7 1024.36(f) lists circumstances under which servicers need not comply with information request requirements under \u00a7 1024.36.

The Bureau believes that this revision is appropriate, as borrowers already have a mechanism by which to request payoff balances under section 129G of TILA with respect to home loans. For those loans that are not subject to section 129G of TILA, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to extend the requirements of that provision beyond the scope mandated by Congress, as implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(c)(3) of the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule."

Proposed comment 36(a)-2 would have clarified that if a borrower requests information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, a servicer complies with its obligations to identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan by identifying the entity that holds the legal obligation to receive payments from a mortgage loan. Proposed comments 36(a)-2.i and 36(a)-2.ii would have provided examples of which party is the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan for different forms of mortgage loan ownership.

Moreover, the commenter asserted that servicers do not typically track the trust name with the account, as such information is rarely used.

The requirement that servicers identify to the borrower the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan was added as section 6(k)(1)(D) of RESPA by the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 6(k)(1)(D) requires that information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan must be provided to borrowers. The Bureau believes that the benefit to borrowers of obtaining the information, which was required by Congress, justifies any concerns about the potential for confusion. As to commenters' concern that trustee information is more relevant than trust information, the Bureau notes that proposed comment 36(a)-2 provided that where a trust is the owner or assignee of a loan, a servicer must provide the name of both the trustee and the trust. Also, for clarification purposes, the Bureau is revising proposed comment 36(a)-2 to state that when a borrower requests information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, a servicer complies by identifying the person on whose behalf the servicer receives payments from the borrower.

                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.36(b), which would have permitted a servicer to establish an exclusive telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information in accordance with the procedures in \u00a7 1024.36. If a servicer chose to establish a separate telephone number and address for information requests, the proposal would have required the servicer to provide the borrower a notice that states that the borrower may request information using the telephone number and address established by the servicer for that purpose. Proposed comment 36(b)-1 would have clarified that if a servicer has not designated a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information, then the servicer will be required to respond to an information request received at any office of the servicer. Proposed comment 36(b)-2 would have further clarified that the written notice to the borrower may be set forth in another written notice provided to the borrower, such as a notice of transfer, periodic statement, or coupon book. Proposed comment 36(b)-2 would have further clarified that if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address for receipt of information requests, the servicer must provide that telephone number and address in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.\n          ", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to allow servicers to establish a telephone number and address that a borrower must use to request information in order to allow servicers to direct oral and written requests to appropriate personnel that have been trained to ensure that the servicer responds appropriately. As the proposal noted, at larger servicers with other consumer financial service affiliates, many personnel simply do not typically deal with mortgage servicing-related issues. For instance, at a major bank servicer, a borrower might request information from a local bank branch staff, who likely would not have access to the information necessary to respond to the request. Thus, the Bureau reasoned, if a servicer establishes a telephone number and address that a borrower must use, a servicer would not be required to comply with the information request requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.36 for requests that may be received by the servicer through a different method.", 
                        "Most industry commenters favored allowing servicers to designate an address and telephone number to which borrowers must direct information requests. At the same time, such commenters asserted that the proposal constituted an insufficient remedy to the burdens inherent in permitting oral information requests. Some commenters said that designating telephone lines for information requests could be especially costly for small servicers. Thus, one community bank trade association argued that the proposal favored large institutions. Two industry commenters requested clarification regarding how servicers must handle information requests sent to the wrong address. Finally, one credit union commenter asserted that servicers should only be required to include designated telephone numbers and addresses in regular forms of communication to borrowers, such as the periodic statement. In contrast, consumer group commenters suggested that to the extent a servicer designates a telephone line or address, the servicer should be required to post such information on its Web site and to include it in mailed notices.", 
                        "Because the final rule removes the requirement that servicers comply with information request requirements under \u00a7 1024.36 for oral information requests, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to regulate the circumstances under which servicers may direct oral information requests to an exclusive telephone number that a borrower must use to request information. However, for written information requests, the Bureau continues to believe that it is reasonable to permit servicers to designate a specific address for the intake of information requests. Allowing a servicer to designate a specific address is consistent with current requirements of Regulation X with respect to qualified written requests. Current \u00a7 1024.21(e)(1) permits a servicer to designate a \u201cseparate and exclusive office and address for the receipt and handling of qualified written requests.\u201d Moreover, the Bureau believes that identifying a specific address for receiving information requests will benefit consumers. By providing a specific address, servicers will identify to consumers the office capable of addressing requests made by consumers.", 
                        "The Bureau believes it is critical for servicers to publicize any designated address to ensure that borrowers know how properly to request information and to avoid evasion by servicers of information request procedures. This is especially important because, as noted in the proposal, servicers who designate a specific address for receipt of information requests are not required to comply with information request procedures for notices sent to the wrong address. Accordingly, final \u00a7 1024.36(b) requires servicers that designate addresses for receipt of requests for information to post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the servicer lists any contact address for the servicer. In addition, final comment 36(b)-2 retains the clarification that servicers that establish an address that a borrower must use to request information, must provide the address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance. The Bureau is otherwise adopting \u00a7 1024.36(b) and comments 36(b)-1 and 36(b)-2 as proposed, except that it has revised the provisions permitting servicers to designate a telephone number that a borrower must use to request information and clarified that the notice must be written."

The Bureau further notes that the contents of the acknowledgment are minimal.

However, the Bureau proposed comment 36(d)(1)(ii)-1 because it believes that burden for information requests will increase greatly if a servicer is required to undertake an investigation for documents that are not in a servicer's possession or control. The same inefficiency exists even if information is in a servicer's possession or control but, for appropriate business reasons, is stored in a medium that is not accessible by a servicer in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau believes that the marginal benefit of having additional information available to borrowers is not justified by the significant burdens that such investigations may incur. Moreover, the Bureau believes that it would frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to require that servicers devote considerable resources, which could otherwise be spent on responding to information requests that would benefit borrowers, to locating inaccessible information.",

During the Small Business Review Panel outreach, small entity representatives expressed that typically qualified written requests received from borrowers were vague forms found online or forms used by advocates as a form of pre-litigation discovery. Servicers and servicing industry representatives indicated that these types of qualified written requests are unreasonable and unduly burdensome.

Industry commenters said servicers should not be required to parse through such submissions to locate a clear information request. One large trade association of mortgage servicers said that the requirement effectively subsumes the exclusion. Consumer group commenters generally disfavored the exclusion. One commenter questioned the assertion that borrowers primarily use qualified written requests to obtain prelitigation discovery. One consumer group said the exclusion gives servicers too much discretion. Another said it requires borrowers to state their information requests with too much specificity. An anonymous consumer advocate said a request from a single borrower should not be so voluminous as to be burdensome for servicers to respond. Another consumer group commenter requested that the Bureau address situations in which the servicer erroneously determines that a submission is overbroad or unduly burdensome.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.36(f)(1)(iv), in part, because the Bureau believes that requiring servicers to respond to overbroad or unduly burdensome information requests from some borrowers may cause servicers to expend fewer resources to address requests that may be more clearly stated and more clearly require servicer attention. The Bureau was especially concerned about this in light of the proposed rule's requirement that servicers respond to an expanded universe of information requests, including requests for information that do not specifically relate to \u201cservicing\u201d as defined in RESPA, as implemented by this rule, as well as information requests asserted orally. While the final rule does not require that servicers undertake the information request procedures in \u00a7 1024.36(c) and (d) for oral submissions, it does not limit information requests to those related to servicing. Thus, the Bureau continues to believe that a requirement for servicers to respond to information requests that are overbroad or unduly burdensome may harm consumers and frustrate servicers' ability to comply with the new information request requirements. Finally, as stated in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that the information request procedures should replace or supplant civil litigation document requests and should not be used as a forum for pre-litigation discovery. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.36(f)(1)(iv) and comment 36(f)(1)(iv)-1 substantially as proposed."

The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.36(g)(1) and (2) for three reasons. First, section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 6(k)(1)(B) to RESPA, which prohibits a servicer from charging fees for responding to valid qualified written requests.

Second, the Bureau believes that a servicer practice of charging for responding to an information request impedes borrowers from pursuing valid information requests, and that the prohibition is therefore necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to borrower requests and complaints. Third, the Bureau learned from outreach with consumer advocates that, in some instances, servicers have demanded that borrowers make payments before the servicer will provide a borrower with information requested by the borrower or will correct errors identified by a borrower.

The trade association argued that the proposed rule should take the fact that a fee is legally permissible into account. A law firm that represents servicers argued that it would be unfair and economically burdensome to prohibit servicers from charging fees for duplicate statements, such as year-end statements and tax forms.",

                        "Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 6 of RESPA to establish new servicer duties with respect to servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance on a property securing a federally related mortgage loan. The statute generally defines \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d as hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage loan. New \u00a7 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA states that a servicer shall not obtain force-placed insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance. New section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) of RESPA further states that servicers must: (1) provide two written notices to a borrower over a notification period lasting at least 45 days before imposing a charge for force-placed insurance on the borrower; (2) accept any reasonable form of written confirmation from a borrower of existing insurance coverage; and (3) within 15 days of the receipt of confirmation of a borrower's existing insurance coverage, terminate force-placed insurance and refund all force-placed insurance premiums paid by the borrower during any period during which the borrower's insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were both in effect, as well as any related fees charged to the borrower's account with respect to force-placed insurance during such period. Section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) of RESPA additionally states that no provisions of section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) shall be construed as prohibiting a servicer from providing simultaneous or concurrent notice of a lack of flood insurance pursuant to section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Section 6(m) of RESPA states that all charges related to force-placed insurance imposed on a borrower by or through a servicer, other than charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance, must be bona fide and reasonable.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.37 to implement the new servicer duties established by section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act in section 6(k) through (m) of RESPA. Force-placed insurance was created by the insurance industry to provide mortgage loan owners and investors with a hazard insurance product that would protect the value of their investment by insuring properties securing mortgage loans when hazard insurance obtained by a borrower lapsed. In recent years, however, force-placed insurance has become a consumer protection concern and has attracted the attention of lawmakers, enforcement officials, and Federal and State regulators.\n            First, a force-placed insurance policy typically provides less coverage than the typical homeowners' insurance policy because force-placed insurance has been designed to provide coverage limited to protecting the value of the dwelling, but not personal property, personal liabilities for injuries on site, and other types of loss included in the scope of coverage of a typical homeowners' insurance policy. Second, although a force-placed insurance policy generally provides less coverage than a homeowners' insurance policy, force-placed insurance policy premiums are generally substantially more expensive than homeowners' insurance policy premiums. One large force-placed insurance provider estimates that the force-placed policies it writes cost, on average, 1.5 to 2 times more than the prior hazard insurance purchased by a borrower.\n            But at the same time, it has been reported that an individual force-placed policy could cost 10 times as much as a homeowners' insurance policy.\n            Explanations for the cost of force-placed insurance differ. Industry stakeholders generally attribute the substantially higher cost of force-placed insurance (relative to homeowners' insurance) to the fact that force-placed insurance: (1) Can be purchased for every mortgage loan in a servicer's portfolio (including vacant properties and other properties that homeowners' insurance providers will not insure); (2) ensures continuous coverage as of the date a homeowners' insurance policy lapses or is canceled; and (3) can be canceled by a servicer at any time, with a full refund back to the date of placement.", 
                        "Consumer groups, however, assert that the higher cost of force-placed insurance can be largely explained by market mechanisms that drive force-placed insurance providers to compete for business from servicers. Consumer groups argue that the cost of force-placed insurance is inflated by incentives like commissions to servicers (or their affiliates) that are licensed to engage in insurance transactions, no-cost or below-cost insurance tracking and monitoring services to servicers because the actual cost is passed on to borrowers in the force-placed insurance premium charge a force-placed insurance provider assesses on a borrower through the servicer, and payments for entering into reinsurance arrangements with servicers (or their affiliates) that are licensed to engage in insurance transactions. Consumer groups and mortgage investors have alleged that servicers have frequently improperly placed force-placed insurance, in some instances to receive lucrative commissions or reinsurance fees, or other consideration.\n            In some cases, consumer groups have asserted that the higher cost of force-placed insurance can drive borrowers, particularly those already facing financial hardship, into default.", 
                        "As discussed above, RESPA is a remedial consumer protection statute and imposes obligations upon the servicing of federally related mortgage loans that are intended to protect borrowers. The Bureau believes that the obligations the Dodd-Frank Act established with respect to servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance were intended to impose, at minimum, (1) a duty to help borrowers avoid unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance through both direct limitations on certain charges and several procedural safeguards; and (2) a duty to provide borrowers with reasonably accurate information about servicers' grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance and the financial impact that such purchase could have on the borrowers, in order to encourage borrowers to take appropriate steps to maintain their hazard insurance policies."

                        "As added by the Dodd-Frank Act, section 6(k)(2) of RESPA states that for purposes of section 6(k) through (m) of RESPA, force-placed insurance means hazard insurance coverage obtained by a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance on such property as required of the borrower under the terms of the mortgage. The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.37(a)(1) to implement section 6(k)(2) of RESPA. The proposed provision stated that in general, for purposes of \u00a7 1024.37, the term \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d means hazard insurance obtained by a servicer on behalf of the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan on a property securing such loan.", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.37(a)(1) did not incorporate language from the statute referring to a borrower's failure to maintain or renew hazard insurance as required under the terms of the mortgage. As explained in the proposal, the Bureau was concerned that adopting that language might raise questions whether the Dodd-Frank Act protections applied to situations in which a borrower did, in fact, have hazard insurance in place but the borrower's servicer obtained force-placed insurance anyway. The Bureau noted that borrowers in such a situation are most in need of protection from unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance. Indeed, in other respects, the force-placed insurance provisions added to RESPA by the Dodd-Frank Act expressly contemplate that the protections apply in circumstances where a borrower, in fact, has hazard insurance in place. For example, the notice to the borrower required under RESPA section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(1)(A) is required to include a statement of the procedures by which the borrower may demonstrate insurance coverage, and under RESPA section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3), which provides that upon receipt by a servicer of confirmation that a borrower has hazard insurance in place, a servicer must terminate force-placed insurance and refund to the borrower all force-placed premiums and related charges for periods of overlapping coverage. Thus, notwithstanding the phrase &#8220;when the borrower has failed to maintain or renew hazard insurance,&#8221; the Bureau interprets the definition of force-placed insurance to include situations in which a servicer obtains hazard insurance coverage on a property where the borrower has in fact maintained the borrower's own hazard insurance. The Bureau also proposed to add language to the definition of the term &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; in proposed &#167; 1024.37(a)(i) to describe the insurance as being obtained by a servicer &#8220;on behalf of the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan on a property securing such loan.&#8221; This language was intended to distinguish force-placed insurance from situations in which a servicer renews borrowers' own hazard insurance policies as described in &#167; 1024.17 or otherwise. The Bureau observes that a servicer is simply renewing a borrower's own hazard insurance under these circumstances and does not interpret such insurance as hazard insurance &#8220;obtained&#8221; by a servicer within the statutory definition of &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; set forth in section 6(k)(2) of RESPA. The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed definition of the term &#8220;force-placed insurance&#8221; set forth in proposed &#167; 1024.37(a)(1). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting &#167; 1024.37(a)(1) as proposed."

The Bureau proposed to exclude flood insurance that is required under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) from the definition of the term \u201cforce-placed insurance,\u201d because, as discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of the defined term \u201cHazard insurance,\u201d the Bureau believed and continues to believe that the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations should not apply to servicers when they are required by the FDPA to purchase flood insurance. As discussed above, the FDPA provides an extensive set of restrictions on a servicers' purchase of flood insurance required by the FDPA, and the Bureau was concerned that subjecting servicers to overlapping regulatory restrictions would be unduly burdensome and might result in consumer confusion.", 
                        "Several consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should only exempt servicers from the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations to the extent they purchase force-placed flood policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) because the FDPA can reasonably be interpreted to require servicers to purchase force-placed flood insurance through the NFIP. The consumer groups further asserted that it was important to ensure that RESPA's consumer protections with respect to force-placed insurance apply when servicers force-place private flood insurance because private force-placed insurance policies are more expensive than the NFIP flood policies. As discussed above, industry commenters generally said that the proposed exclusion of hazard insurance to protect against flood loss obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of the term \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d was workable and adequately mitigated the risk of a servicer having to comply with both regulations under the FDPA and the Bureau's force-placed insurance regulations.", 
                        "The Bureau has carefully considered these comments and is adopting proposed \u00a7 1024.37(a)(2)(i) as proposed. The Bureau does not administer the FDPA, and accordingly declines to opine on whether the FDPA requires servicers to purchase flood insurance policies from the NFIP. The Bureau, however, observes that there is existing guidance from Federal agencies that administer the FPDA that suggests that a servicer may reasonably interpret the FDPA to permit servicers to satisfy their obligations under the statute through the purchase of private flood insurance.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Moreover, the consumer groups did not suggest that the consumer protections in the FDPA do not apply to a servicer's purchase of private flood insurance, and the Bureau has no reason to believe that they do not. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that if the Bureau were to adopt the consumer groups' suggestion to exclude from the definition of the term \u201cforce-placed insurance\u201d only policies purchased under the NFIP, a servicer who purchased private flood insurance to comply with its obligations under the FDPA would have to comply with both the Bureau's regulations and regulations under the FDPA. As discussed above, this result would impose unnecessary compliance burdens and frustrate the consumer protection purposes of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions. For the reasons discussed above, \u00a7 1024.37(a)(2)(i) is necessary and appropriate to avoid undermining the consumer protection purposes of RESPA's force-placed provisions and is thus authorized under sections 6(k)(1)(E), 6(j)(3), and 19(a) of RESPA."

A number of industry commenters requested that the Bureau change proposed \u00a7 1024.37(b) so that the reasonable basis standard in \u00a7 1024.37(b) would be defined solely by compliance with the procedural requirements enumerated in section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) of RESPA and &#167; 1024.37(c) and (d)\n            \n            or, in the alternative, would provide a safe harbor for servicers that meet such requirements. One large force-placed insurance provider and one large bank servicer said that if the Bureau did not change proposed &#167; 1024.37(b), then the Bureau should expressly state in commentary to &#167; 1024.37(b) that the examples are illustrative and do not provide the only situations in which a servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower's hazard insurance has lapsed. One national trade association representing federal credit unions suggested that the Bureau provide a safe harbor for servicers acting in good faith when they obtained force-placed insurance.", 
                        "After careful review of these comments and further consideration, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(b) with changes. First, the Bureau has concluded that when a servicer purchases force-placed insurance but does not charge a borrower for such insurance, the servicer does not \u201cobtain\u201d force-placed insurance within the meaning of section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA. The Bureau arrived at this conclusion after re-evaluating the connection between section 6(k)(1)(A) and (<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>). As described above, section 6(k)(1)(A) establishes that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan shall not obtain force-placed insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance. Section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) establishes that a servicer of a federally related mortgage loan shall not be construed as having a reasonable basis for obtaining force-placed insurance unless the requirements of section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) have been met. But one of the requirements is that a servicer must terminate force-placed insurance within 15 days of the servicer receiving confirmation of a borrower's existing insurance coverage. The Bureau believes that this provision expressly contemplates that a servicer may purchase force-placed insurance before meeting the requirements of section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>). Accordingly, where &#8220;obtaining&#8221; is used in section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>), the Bureau interprets the statute to mean &#8220;charging.&#8221; Because &#8220;obtain&#8221; appears in section 6(k)(1)(A) and 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>), the Bureau has changed &#167; 1024.37(b) to reflect more clearly the statutory prohibition against &#8220;charging.&#8221; Accordingly, as finalized, &#167; 1024.37(b) provides that a servicer may not assess on a borrower a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance unless the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the mortgage loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance.", 
                        "The Bureau has also changed commentary intended to explain the circumstances that provide a servicer with a \u201creasonable basis to believe\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.37(b). The Bureau has decided not to provide specific examples of \u201ca reasonable basis to believe.\u201d Instead, as adopted, comment 37(b)-1 provides that information about a borrower's hazard insurance received by a servicer from a borrower, the borrower's insurance provider or insurance agent, may provide a servicer with a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. The Bureau believed that sometimes the absence of information may provide a servicer with a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirement to maintain hazard insurance. Accordingly, proposed comment 37(b)-1 would have clarified that a servicer had a reasonable basis to believe that a borrower with an escrow account established for hazard insurance has failed to maintain hazard insurance if the servicer had not received a renewal bill within a reasonable time prior to the expiration date of the borrower's hazard insurance. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that the comment may convey that the absence of information would provide a servicer with a safe harbor. The Bureau believes that a safe harbor based on the absence of information would not adequately ensure that borrowers are protected from unwarranted and unnecessary charges related to force-placed insurance. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting commentary to provide that in the absence of receiving information about a borrower's hazard insurance, a servicer may satisfy the reasonable basis to believe standard if a servicer acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status, and does not receive, from the borrower or otherwise have evidence of insurance coverage as provided in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).", 
                        "The Bureau has concluded that a servicer following the notification procedure established by section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) of RESPA has acted with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status, but compliance with those procedural elements alone are not sufficient to provide a safe harbor. The statute prohibits a servicer from imposing any charge on a borrower for force-placed insurance if the servicer has received demonstration of hazard insurance coverage by the end of the notification process. Accordingly, comment 37(b)-1, as adopted, explains that an example of acting with reasonable diligence is one in which a servicer complies with the notification requirements set forth in &#167; 1024.37(c)(1)(i) and (ii), and if after complying with such requirements, the servicer does not receive, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence of insurance coverage as provided in &#167; 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).", 
                        "The Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to provide a separate safe harbor for servicers acting in good faith because the Bureau believes the standard set forth in \u00a7 1024.37(b) provides sufficient flexibility for servicers to balance their obligations to owners and assignees of mortgage loans to ensure that a property is adequately insured and to protect borrowers from unwarranted and unnecessary charges and fees. The Bureau also declines to adopt a collective standard to evaluate whether a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance is proper. The Bureau believes that the percentage of cases in which a borrower receives a full refund for force-placed insurance charges may be relevant in assessing whether a servicer is maintaining reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that a servicer is maintaining accurate information about a borrower's mortgage loan. But the Bureau believes that section 6(k)(1)(A) of RESPA established a loan-level standard. Using a collective standard to evaluate whether a servicer has satisfied the reasonable basis to believe requirement in section 6(k)(1)(A) would not be appropriate because the standard would be overbroad and might discourage a servicer from obtaining force-placed insurance even though a servicer has actual information that a borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance.", 
                        "A state trade association representing banks and one of its member banks urged the Bureau to eliminate proposed \u00a7 1024.37(b). They expressed concern that the reasonable basis standard, in combination with the prohibition on charging a borrower for insurance in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) for at least 45 days, would increase the likelihood that homes go uninsured for a significant period of time. The Bureau declines to eliminate \u00a7 1024.37(b) because the Bureau believes the provision is necessary to implement RESPA's force-placed provisions. In addition, the Bureau believes that the commenters' concern is unwarranted, in particular, because \u00a7 1024.37(b) has been revised to reframe the prohibition as one on charging the borrower for, rather than purchasing, force-placed insurance.", 
                        "Lastly, a state trade association representing banks and thrifts expressed concern that servicers may rely on information from an insurance provider that later turns out to be incorrect about the status of a borrower's hazard insurance coverage to purchase force-placed insurance. For example, the commenter said that insurance providers may send notices of cancellation to servicers before a borrower's insurance actually lapses. The Bureau recognizes that servicers may sometimes wrongly conclude that there is a reasonable basis to charge borrowers for force-placed insurance, even after complying with the procedures steps in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1). But whether \u00a7 1024.37(b) is violated turns on whether or not a servicer had a reasonable basis to reach its conclusion based on the information the servicer has at the time the servicer charges a borrower for force-placed insurance."

Proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(1) would have provided that a servicer may not charge a borrower for force-placed insurance unless: (1) A servicer delivers to the borrower or places in the mail a written notice with the disclosures set forth in &#167; 1024.37(c)(2) at least 45 days before the premium charge or any fee is assessed; (2) it delivers to such borrower or places in the mail a written notice in accordance with &#167; 1024.37(d)(1), which would have prohibited a servicer from delivering or placing in the mail this second notice until 30 days have passed after the servicer has delivered or placed in the mail the first written notice required by &#167; 1024.37(c)(1)(i); and (3) during the 45-day notice period, the servicer has not received verification that such borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously. Proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) also stated that determining whether the borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously, the servicer shall take account of any grace period provided under State or other applicable law. The Bureau proposed to permit a servicer to choose between delivering the written notice to the borrower or mailing the written notices established by section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(1)(A) and (B) of RESPA because the Bureau believed it was necessary and proper to achieve the purposes of RESPA to provide servicers with flexibility to either deliver or mail the required notices, since delivery will often be faster than transmittal by mail.", 
                        "Proposed comment 37(c)(1)-1 would have clarified the minimum length of the notice period. It stated that notice period set forth in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) begins on the day that the servicer delivers or mails the notice to the borrower and expires 45 days later, and that the servicer may assess the premium charge and any fees for force-placed insurance beginning on the 46th day if the servicer has fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 1024.37(c) and (d). The comment further stated that if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, the servicer may retroactively charge a borrower for force-placed insurance obtained during the 45-day notice period. Proposed comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-1 would have provided examples of borrowers having hazard insurance in place continuously.", 
                        "Two non-bank servicers stated that they supported proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) and related commentary. One of the commenters observed that the Bureau's proposal reflects its current practice. This is consistent with feedback from small servicers with whom the Small Business Review Panel conducted outreach in advance of the proposal. One participant stated that it currently provides two notices that are very similar to the ones that would be required, and another participant stated that it currently exceeds the number of notices that would be required.", 
                        "The Bureau received comments on various aspects of proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1). Except as discussed below, the majority of industry commenters did not raise concerns with the notification aspect of proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1). The majority of industry commenters only sought clarification. First, they requested the Bureau clarify that a servicer may retroactively charge a borrower for force-placed insurance back to the date that a borrower's hazard insurance lapsed, even if the servicer sends the first notice after the date of lapse. Second, a number of industry commenters requested that the Bureau clarify how a servicer should account for grace periods when determining whether a borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously. They observed that a grace period under a typical hazard insurance policy extends a policyholder's insurance coverage past the expiration date only if the policyholder pays the past-due premium during such period. A bank servicer requested the Bureau clarify that \u201cgrace period\u201d used in proposed \u00a7 1024.37 refer to grace periods applicable to the borrower's hazard insurance, and not grace periods applicable to the borrower's loan during which the borrower pays the mortgage payment after the due date without incurring a late charge. One large bank servicer sought clarification of whether the notice period could exceed 45 days.", 
                        "A minority of industry commenters opposed the notification aspect of proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1). One credit union contended that the proposed notices would be duplicative, unnecessary, and add to the overall cost of lending because borrowers already receive multiple notices from their insurers prior to cancellation. A trade association representing retail banks asserted that if a borrower's hazard insurance coverage lapses before the second notice is provided, then a servicer should be able to obtain force-placed insurance without having to send the second notice. A bank servicer argued that rather than requiring a servicer to send a second notice at least 15 days prior to charging a borrower for force-placed insurance, the Bureau should instead permit a servicer to simply provide a notice within five days of purchasing force-placed insurance. One state credit union league expressed concern about the aggregate notice burden servicers would be required to bear if the mortgage servicing rules are finalized as proposed and suggested that the burden could be reduced if the Bureau combines the first and second written notice into a single notice. One credit union asserted that the Bureau should allow a servicer to include the proposed force-placed insurance notices with the periodic statement because multiple documents mailed to the borrower could decrease the probability of the borrower actually paying attention to the information.", 
                        "Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to reconsider the aspect of the proposal that would have required servicers to wait at least 45 days to charge a borrower for force-placed insurance. The commenters contended that servicers, especially small servicers, would incur significant costs because servicers would have to advance force-placed insurance charges for borrowers. One state credit union trade association urged the Bureau to exercise its exception authority to exempt small servicers from the requirements of \u00a7 1024.37(c). In addition to the cost of advancement, the commenter also asserted that it would be costly for small servicers to send the notices. One non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau shorten the notice period to 30 days, while a bank servicer urged the Bureau to shorten the notice period to 10 days. One bank servicer also requested the Bureau to preempt Texas law that addresses notification requirements that apply to creditors' purchase of force-placed insurance for residential mortgages.", 
                        "One bank servicer commented that a rule requiring servicers to provide notices like the proposed periodic statement or force-placed insurance notices to borrowers would be a waste of servicer resources without a corresponding benefit to consumers in situations involving a borrower whom the servicer has referred to foreclosure, a borrower who has declared bankruptcy, or a borrower who has made no payment or contacted the servicer for more than six months and whom the servicer has determined to have vacated the property. It sought an exemption from compliance with any force-placed insurance notification requirements with regard to those three categories of borrowers. One national trade association representing credit unions and a credit union commenter expressed concern that credit union members may believe that they should only be charged from the date that they received the first notice. Lastly, some industry commenters stated that a servicer should not be subject to a waiting period of 45 days to obtain force-placed insurance because it leaves collateral exposed and increases the risk to the borrower.", 
                        "In contrast, one consumer advocacy group urged the Bureau to strengthen the notification requirement so that a servicer would be required to provide the first notice within 15 days of placing force-placed insurance. It further asserted that it would be unreasonable to permit a servicer to retroactively charge a borrower for more than 60 days of force-placed insurance because it is a servicer's responsibility to identify lapses in insurance and notify borrowers of such lapses in a timely fashion.", 
                        "Lastly, several industry commenters requested the Bureau clarify what \u201cverification\u201d means because they were concerned that the proposal would have required servicers to accept any insurance information they received from borrowers. The commenters noted that the traditional means of establishing proof of insurance is by requiring a borrower to provide a copy of an insurance policy declaration page, a certificate of insurance, or the insurance policy. The commenters expressed concern that without any of these, servicers may might potentially not be able to provide mortgage investors with the proof such investors require as evidence of coverage.", 
                        "After careful consideration of these comments and further consideration, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) with several adjustments. With respect to the notification aspect of \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1), the Bureau notes that RESPA establishes a very detailed scheme for any servicer (without consideration of the servicer's size) to follow before a servicer imposes a charge on any borrower for force-placed insurance. The Bureau believes that the prescriptive nature of the statutory scheme suggests that Congress believed that each step was necessary to achieve the consumer protection purpose of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions. The notification procedures the Bureau proposed in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) mirror the prescriptive statutory scheme because they were necessary to achieve the intent of Congress. The Bureau declines to adopt suggestions received from commenters, which ranged from creating exemptions for small servicers and unresponsive borrowers to changing various aspects of the notification requirements, because they would make \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) depart from the statutory scheme Congress established.", 
                        "The Bureau has also worked to craft effective notices through consumer testing, and the results of those tests suggest that borrowers will in fact welcome and respond to the notices. The Bureau further believes that some of the commenters' concerns are addressed by the fact that the Bureau is interpreting the statutory language to allow charges to be assessed retroactively for any period in which coverage was not maintained continuously once the procedural and substantive statutory criteria are met. Moreover, the Bureau believes that it is unnecessary to set limitations on a servicer's right to assess on borrowers charges retroactively because the statute establishes that a borrower has an unconditional right to a full refund of force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees the borrower has paid for any period in which the borrower's hazard insurance and the force-placed insurance were both in place.", 
                        "With respect to the request for preemption, the Bureau observes that based on the way in which the commenter described Texas law, it does not appear that compliance with Texas law would prevent a servicer from complying with the Bureau's force-placed insurance notification requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau believes preemption is not appropriate based on the information provided.", 
                        "The Bureau is making several changes to \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) for clarification purposes. The Bureau is adopting new comment \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(i) to clarify that a servicer may charge a borrower for force-placed insurance a servicer purchased, retroactive to the first day of any period in which the borrower did not have hazard insurance in place. The Bureau is clarifying the role of a grace period under applicable law in determining whether a borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously in new comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-1. The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) to clarify what \u201creceiving verification\u201d means by replacing the phrase \u201creceived verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place continuously\u201d in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(iii) with the phrase \u201creceived, from the borrower or otherwise, evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had in place continuously hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance.\u201d", 
                        "The Bureau has concluded that putting the responsibility entirely on a servicer to verify a borrower's hazard insurance coverage by requiring a servicer to accept any written information from a borrower as long as it contains the insurance policy number, and the name, mailing address and phone number of the borrower's insurance company or the borrower's insurance agency as evidence of insurance would impose too large of a burden on a servicer to determine whether the property is in fact insured in accordance with the terms and conditions of a borrower's loan contract. Accordingly, in new comment 1024.37(c)(1)(iii)-2, the Bureau is explaining that as evidence of continuous hazard insurance coverage that complies with the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance, a servicer may require a copy of the borrower's hazard insurance policy declaration page, the borrower's insurance certificate, the borrower's insurance policy, or other similar forms of written confirmation because the Bureau interprets the statutory language \u201creasonable form of written confirmation of existing insurance coverage\u201d in section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(2) of RESPA to mean documents servicers typically require borrowers to provide to establish proof of coverage. Further, comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-2 provides that a servicer may reject evidence of hazard insurance coverage submitted by the borrower if neither the borrower's insurance provider nor insurance agent provides confirmation of the insurance information submitted by the borrower, or if the terms and conditions of the borrower's hazard insurance policy do not comply with the borrower's loan contract requirements because the Bureau interprets section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3) of RESPA to permit a servicer to separately confirm insurance information that a borrower has proffered to establish proof of coverage and the statutory language in section 6(k)(1)(A) to permit a servicer to charge a borrower force-placed insurance when the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract's requirements to maintain property insurance.", 
                        "With respect to the request to clarify that the 45-day notification period set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1) establishes the minimum amount of time that must lapse between the time a servicer sends a borrower the first written notice required by section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(1) and the time a servicer imposes a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance, the Bureau believes that the fact that the Bureau intended the 45 days to be the minimum amount of time was clear in the proposal and thus, does not believe additional clarification in the final rule is necessary."

Proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(2) would have required a servicer to set forth, in the notice that would have been required under proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(1)(i), certain information about force-placed insurance. Specifically, proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(2)(i) through (iv) would have required a servicer to disclose the following information: (1) The date of the notice; (2) the servicer's name and mailing address; (3) the borrower's name and mailing address; and (4) a statement that requests the borrower to provide hazard insurance information for the borrower's property and identifies the property by its address.

Proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(2)(vi) would have required that a servicer provide a statement that hazard insurance is required on the borrower's property and that the servicer has obtained or will obtain, as applicable, insurance at the borrower's expense.",

Proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(viii) would have required the notice to contain a description of how the borrower may provide the information requested pursuant to \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(vii).", 
                        "Finally, \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) and (x) would have required information regarding the relative costs and scope of coverage of force-placed insurance versus hazard insurance obtained by the borrower, specifically: (1) The cost of the force-placed insurance, stated as an annual premium, or as a good faith estimate if actual pricing is not available; and (2) a statement that insurance the servicer obtains may cost significantly more than hazard insurance obtained by the borrower and may not provide as much coverage as hazard insurance obtained by the borrower. Proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(xi) would have required that a servicer provide the servicer's telephone number for borrower questions.", 
                        "The disclosures regarding the potential cost and scope of coverage for force-placed insurance were not specifically required under the Dodd-Frank Act, but the Bureau believed that it was appropriate to propose them pursuant to the Bureau's RESPA section 6(k)(1)(E) authority in order to provide borrowers with critical information about the benefits, costs, and risks of the insurance that would be imposed if they failed to act. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the Bureau tested the force-placed insurance disclosures established by the Dodd-Frank Act in three rounds of consumer testing. Participant response in consumer testing suggested that knowing about higher cost of force-placed insurance could motivate borrowers to act promptly and thus avoid being charged for force-placed insurance. All participants said upon receipt of the notice, they would immediately contact their insurance provider to find out whether or not their hazard insurance had expired or purchase new hazard insurance because they would not want to pay for the higher cost of force-placed insurance.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed comment 37(c)(2)(ix)-1 to clarify that the good faith estimate of the cost of the force-placed insurance the servicer may obtain should be consistent with the best information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the disclosure is provided. The proposed comment stated that differences between the amount of the estimated cost disclosed under \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) and the actual cost do not necessarily constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the estimated cost was based on the best information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the disclosure was provided. The Bureau believed that its proposed good faith standard would provide significant safeguards against the risk that some servicers might intentionally underestimate the cost of force-placed insurance while providing sufficient flexibility to account for the fact that costs may change due to legitimate reasons between the time the disclosure is made and the time the borrower is charged.", 
                        "Several consumer groups applauded the content requirements the Bureau proposed, but with one caveat. They expressed concern that the proposed disclosure concerning the fact that force-placed insurance may not provide as much coverage as borrower-obtained hazard insurance was too generic, and thus would not provide information meaningful enough to alert the borrower to the risks of force-placed insurance and prompt the borrower to act. They suggested adding additional disclosures that force-placed insurance would not cover damage to the borrower's personal property, personal liability for injuries to others while they are on the borrower's property, or living expenses while the borrower's home is under repair. The Bureau has considered the consumer groups' concern but is reluctant to add further information without consumer testing in light of the risk that information overload could adversely impact the effectiveness of the notice. The Bureau also notes that results of the testing of the model forms suggest that the existing disclosures will prompt recipients of the force-placed insurance notices to act promptly. As summarized by Macro in its report on the consumer testing of mortgage servicing disclosures during the pre-proposal stage, all subjects who were shown samples of force-placed insurance notices said they would act immediately in response to receiving such notices, even though the samples did not contain detailed description of potential coverage differences.", 
                        "One consumer group suggested that a statement informing a borrower of the availability of State-created hazard insurance programs should be a required disclosure because these programs are designed to make hazard insurance available to borrowers who have trouble qualifying for insurance from traditional sources. Again, the Bureau has considered the issue but is reluctant to add further information without consumer testing in light of the risks of information overload. The Bureau is also concerned that a completely generic notice that State programs \u201cmay\u201d be available without contact information would not be very useful to consumers, and that tailoring the notices to particular States would be burdensome to servicers. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to implement the comment. The commenter also urged the Bureau to require servicers to include force-placed insurance charges in regular invoice statements that are sent to a borrower so that a borrower is constantly reminded of how much of the borrower's payments are going toward paying for such insurance. Another consumer group submitted similar comments recommending that the Bureau require servicers to identify force-placed insurance charges specifically in proposed periodic statements so that borrowers could easily recognize when force-placed insurance has been obtained. The Bureau notes that servicers will be required to list force-placed insurance charges like any other charge, in the periodic statement that the Bureau is finalizing in the 2012 TILA Servicing Final Rule.", 
                        "Consumer advocates and some industry commenters praised the proposal to require actual cost information or estimated costs in the mandatory disclosures. A force-placed insurance commenter, for instance, stated that it currently provides its borrowers with such estimates and that it has proven successful in convincing borrowers of the benefit of obtaining their own coverage. Some industry commenters, however, opposed the proposed disclosure as unnecessary because the Bureau separately proposed to require servicers to inform borrowers that force-placed insurance may cost significantly more than borrower-obtained hazard insurance. One force-placed insurance provider further observed that the existing practice of most servicers is to provide a binder of the force-placed insurance coverage with the second notice to make borrowers aware of the cost of such insurance. These commenters and a large bank servicer further noted that the National Mortgage Settlement did not include a required disclosure about the cost of force-placed insurance and urged the Bureau to refrain from requiring more disclosures than required by the settlement.", 
                        "Commenters also asserted that a servicer might not have enough information to provide an estimate of force-placed insurance costs because the first notice would be provided to a borrower at a point where a servicer might not have obtained the premium information. Estimates are also complicated by the fact that the cost of insurance is determined by factors not within the servicer's control (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> insurers' pricing formulas, the number of days a borrower is delinquent on the mortgage loan). Two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry asserted that if a servicer does not rely on a third party to track a borrower's hazard insurance, the servicer would not have the information necessary to make good faith estimates of insurance premiums until the force-placed insurance is actually issued. One of the commenters asserted that this problem is likely to be most acute for small servicers because they often do not hire third parties to track a borrower's hazard insurance. The two commenters also questioned whether a servicer could be held liable for differences between an estimate and the actual cost under a theory that the differences were caused by unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. They also questioned whether a servicer would have the authority to provide the estimate because for an estimate to be binding, an insurance binder from a licensed insurance agent or provider is required. The two commenters and a force-placed insurance provider also expressed concern that the potential inaccuracies with estimate costs may lead to customer confusion and complaints. Lastly, several industry commenters expressed concern with the use of the phrase &#8220;good faith estimate&#8221; because the phrase is a defined term in existing Regulation X with a different meaning than the meaning set forth in proposed comment 37(c)(2)(ix)-1.", 
                        "After considering these comments, the Bureau is withdrawing the requirement to provide the cost of force-placed insurance (or a good faith estimate of the cost) in the notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(i), but keeping the requirement for purposes of the reminder notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(ii). The Bureau believes that this will reduce compliance burden concerns while continuing to assure that borrowers receive specific prices or estimates that are likely to provide strong motivation to renew their homeowners' insurance policies. Additionally, the regulatory text is changed to refer to a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d rather than a \u201cgood faith estimate,\u201d and the commentary is changed to clarify what a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d means.", 
                        "A number of industry commenters recommended that the Bureau allow servicers to provide a borrower with additional information about force-placed insurance. They stated that servicers currently provide a number of disclosures in addition to the information the Bureau has proposed in response to State disclosure requirements, class action litigation, and industry best practices. Commenters expressed concern that the failure by servicers to include additional information may subject servicers to further litigation and extensive potential liability. Some commenters suggested that the Bureau permit servicers to include additional information and the required information in one document. One large bank servicer suggested an alternative approach where a servicer would be permitted to include additional information in the same transmittal that is used to provide notices containing the required information.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that providing additional information in the same notice as the required information could obscure the most important information or tend to create information overload. For instance, one industry commenter provided a list of additional information that included 10 specific pieces of information and a catch-all category for disclosures related to force-placed insurance imposed by other State or Federal law. The Bureau believes it would be better if servicers have latitude to provide the additional information on separate pieces of paper in the same transmittal. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting new \u00a7 1024.37(c)(4) to provide that a servicer may not include any information other than information required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2) in the written notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(i), but that a servicer may provide such additional information to a borrower in the same transmittal as the transmittal used to provide the notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(i) but on separate pieces of paper. The Bureau is adopting parallel provisions in \u00a7 1024.37(d) and (e), numbered as \u00a7 1024.37(d)(4) and (e)(4), respectively. The Bureau has also revised \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2) to permit the notice required by \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(i) to include, if applicable, a statement advising a borrower to review additional information provided in the same transmittal. The Bureau has adopted parallel provisions in \u00a7 1024.37(d) and (e)."

To implement this provision, the Bureau proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(3) and (d)(3) in parallel. Proposed 1024.37(c)(3) stated that disclosures set forth in proposed &#167; 1024.37(c)(2) must be in a format substantially similar to form MS-3(A), set forth in appendix MS-3.

Disclosure made pursuant to &#167; 1024.37(c)(2)(iv) must be in bold text, except that the physical address of the borrower's property may be in regular text. The Bureau believed the use of bold text to bring attention to important information would make it easier for borrowers to identify promptly the purpose of the notice and to find the information quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the Bureau stated in the proposal that the Bureau believed that it was important to bring attention to the cost of force-placed insurance so borrowers have a clear understanding of the cost to them of the service that servicers provide in obtaining force-placed insurance. The Bureau further noted that it believed that it was important for borrowers to understand that the servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance arises from the borrower's obligation to maintain hazard insurance. Although the notice contains additional information that is important, the Bureau believes the usefulness of highlighting in focusing a borrower's attention on important information decreases if highlighting is used unsparingly.",

It observed that the forms were thoughtfully designed and should be readily understandable to consumers. Another large bank servicer agreed with the Bureau's rationale that model forms facilitate compliance with the new Dodd-Frank Act requirements concerning force-placed insurance disclosures and the Bureau's proposed supplemental disclosures, but sought clarification that servicers may use the model forms as guidance but are not required to demonstrate strict adherence to the language of the forms. One non-bank servicer argued that disclosure forms should generally be open-ended to allow the servicer to provide all the content required by the Bureau while allowing the servicer to tailor the form to its needs; however, the commenter stated that it did not have concerns with the model force-placed insurance forms the Bureau proposed.",

                        "As the Bureau noted in the proposal, section 6(k)(1)(B) of RESPA can be read to require a servicer to provide the same disclosures a borrower has previously received. However, where a borrower responds to the first notice by providing insurance information, the Bureau believed that the reminder notice would be more useful if it contained an acknowledgement of the information these borrowers provided in response to the first notice and informed these borrowers that the information provided was not sufficient for a servicer to verify that they had continuous coverage in place. The Bureau observed in the proposal that simply repeating the same content as the first notice might cause borrowers to become frustrated and confused by the fact that they are receiving another notice asking for insurance information when they thought they had already provided such information.",

The Bureau proposed related commentary, comment 37(d)(4)-1, that would have provided that five days prior to the delivery or mailing of the second notice is a reasonable time and invited comments on whether, in certain circumstances, a longer time frame is reasonable.", 
                        "As discussed above, the Bureau observes that one of the minimum consumer protection purposes Congress intended to establish by creating new servicer duties with respect to a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance is to provide a borrower with reasonably accurate information about a servicer's grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance. The Bureau believes that a servicer has a duty to ensure that the second notice contains reasonably accurate information about an individual borrower's hazard insurance status. Therefore, the Bureau believes that a servicer has a duty to update the second notice if it receives new insurance information about a borrower after sending the first written notice to the borrower. The Bureau, however, observed in the proposal that a servicer might have to prepare the written notice in advance of sending it. Accordingly, the Bureau explained that it believed that it was appropriate to create a safe harbor of five days to protect a servicer acting diligently from exposure to potential litigation if the information the servicer provided in the second notice turns out to be, in fact, inaccurate, due to information about a borrower's hazard insurance it receives subsequent to putting the second notice into production.", 
                        "One force-placed insurance provider and two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry recommended the Bureau withdraw proposed \u00a7 1024.37(d)(4) or, in the alternative, expand the safe harbor to 10 days, excluding legal holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, because some servicers use third-party service providers to prepare force-placed insurance notices and need a period of longer than 5 days to prepare the notices. The force-placed insurance provider contended that servicers are going to update the second notice or not send the second notice at all if they have received verification of a borrower's hazard insurance because they would not want to send their customers unnecessary notices. Two other force-placed insurance providers also recommended that the safe harbor be expanded to 10 days from the date that a borrower's insurance is verified, but did not indicate whether 10 days should exclude legal holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays.", 
                        "The Bureau observes that as discussed above, the intent of \u00a7 1024.37(d)(4) is to create a safe harbor to protect servicers who are diligent in ensuring that borrowers receive reasonably accurate information from potential litigation risk. Accordingly, the Bureau is concerned that a 10-day safe harbor, even one that includes legal public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, would be overbroad and give the benefit of the safe harbor to servicers who are not diligent in ensuring that borrowers receive accurate information. But the Bureau has concluded that servicers that use third-party service providers to prepare force-placed insurance notices could reasonably require more than 5 days to prepare the second written notice in a timely manner, especially a five-day period that includes a legal public holiday, Saturday, or Sunday. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 37(d)(4)-1 with a change to clarify that the 5-day period excludes legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The Bureau believes this adjustment strikes the right balance between achieving the consumer protection of providing a borrower with accurate information about a servicer's grounds for purchasing force-placed insurance and providing diligent servicers with a safe harbor from potential litigation risk."

                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e) to prohibit a servicer from charging a borrower for the replacement or renewal of an existing force-placed insurance policy unless certain procedural requirements are followed as specified in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e). The Bureau proposed the requirements because pre-proposal outreach suggested that there is no widespread industry standard that applies to renewal procedures for force-placed insurance. Moreover, commissions and reinsurance agreements may create strong incentives at renewal as well as at original placement. The Bureau believes that the renewal notice is authorized under RESPA section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>), which provides that a servicer does not have a reasonable basis to obtain force-placed insurance unless certain notice requirements are met, and does not limit such requirements to the first time a servicer obtains and charges a borrower for force-placed insurance. The Bureau has, however, made certain adjustments to the notice and procedure requirements set forth in RESPA section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>), as described below, to account for the fact that in the case of the renewal of forced-placed insurance, the borrower already will have received at least two prior force-placed insurance notices. Section 1024.37(e) is further authorized under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA as necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including avoiding unwarranted charges and fees and ensuring the provision to borrowers of accurate and relevant information. As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting proposed &#167; 1024.37(e) generally as proposed with a few changes to address issues that were raised in comments."

Accordingly, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1)(iii) to permit a servicer who has renewed or replaced existing force-placed insurance during the notice period to charge a borrower for such renewal or replacement promptly after a servicer receives verification that the hazard insurance obtained by a borrower did not provide a borrower with insurance coverage for any period of time following the expiration of the existing force-placed insurance, notwithstanding \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii). The Bureau proposed comment 37(e)(1)(iii)-1 to provide an example of what this means.", 
                        "Two national trade associations representing the mortgage industry observed that it is common industry practice for a servicer to send renewal notice to borrowers but urged that the Bureau permit servicers to charge a borrower for the renewal of existing force-placed insurance at the time of purchase because a servicer should not have to incur the burden of not being able to impose a charge on a borrower related to force-placed insurance at the time of renewal or replacement. The Bureau declines to modify the proposal because the Bureau believes imposing a notice period during which a servicer is prohibited from charging a borrower for force-placed insurance is appropriate and necessary to help a borrower avoid the cost associated with the borrower's servicer renewing or replacing the borrower's hazard insurance. The Bureau further notes that a servicer can provide the 45-day notice in advance of the expiration of the current forced place coverage, and accordingly, disagrees that \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1) would invariably prohibit a servicer from imposing a charge on a borrower related to force-placed insurance at the time of renewal or replacement. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1) as proposed, except technical changes to clarify what evidence of borrower's coverage means for \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1). New comment 37(e)(1)-1 clarifies that a servicer may require a borrower to provide a form of written confirmation as described in comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-3 and may reject evidence of coverage submitted by the borrower for the reasons described in comment 37(c)(1)(iii)-2. Comment 37(e)(1)(iii) is adopted as proposed."

The Bureau explained in the proposal that the main differences between the disclosures set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2) and proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e)(2) are that in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e)(2), servicers must provide a statement that: (1) The servicer previously obtained insurance on the borrower's property and assessed the cost of the insurance to the borrower because the servicer did not have evidence that the borrower had hazard insurance coverage for the property; and (2) the servicer has the right to maintain insurance by renewing or replacing the insurance it previously obtained because insurance is required. The Bureau believes the differences are necessary to distinguish the notice required pursuant to proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e)(1) from the notice required pursuant to proposed \u00a7 1024.37(c)(1). The proposed requirement in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(ix) concerning provision of the cost of the force-placed insurance, stated as an annual premium, or a good faith estimate of such cost, would have been replicated in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(e)(2)(vii), with related commentary that would have explained that the good faith requirement set forth in \u00a7 1024.37(e)(2)(vii) is the same good faith requirement set forth in \u00a7 1024.37(c)(2)(ix).",

Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting this requirement in the final rule (revised to refer to a &#8220;reasonable estimate&#8221;) and made technical changes in related commentary to reflect this revision. For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is not permitting a servicer to include additional information in the notice required by &#167; 1024.37(e)(1). But, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting new &#167; 1024.37(e)(4) to permit servicers to provide additional information in the same transmittal the servicer uses to provide the replacement or renewal notice."

The Bureau also noted that some small servicers who participated in the Small Business Review Panel expressed concerns about the cost of sending renewal notices over a 12-month period because unlike large servicers, a number of small servicers purchase force-placed insurance policies that would have to be renewed monthly. The Bureau, however, solicited comments on whether providing the renewal or replacement notice once during a 12-month period would adequately inform borrowers about the costs, benefits, and risks associated with servicers' renewal or replacement of existing force-placed insurance.", 
                        "One large force-placed insurance provider commented that one notice per year is sufficient to remind borrowers without overly burdening the servicer or potentially inundating borrowers with multiple and repetitive notices. In contrast, a state consumer group asserted that one notice over a 12-month period may not be enough to adequately inform borrowers of the costs, benefits, and risks of servicer's renewal or replacement of force-placed insurance and urged the Bureau to require a servicer to provide at least two renewal notices over a 12-month period to inform borrowers of the force-placed insurance premium they would be charged.",

The Bureau proposed &#167; 1024.37(g)(1) and (2) to implement section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3) of RESPA. Section 1024.37(g)(1) and (2) would have provided that within 15 days of receiving verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place, a servicer must cancel force-placed insurance obtained for a borrower's property and for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place, refund to the borrower all force-placed insurance premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower for such period. Proposed &#167; 1024.37(g)(2) would have also required a servicer to remove all force-placed insurance charges and related fees that the servicer has assessed to the borrower for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place from the borrower's account. The Bureau believes that Congress, by establishing the duty to provide a full refund of the force-placed insurance premium and related charges paid by a borrower for any period of time during which the borrower's hazard insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were both in effect, also intended to establish the duty to remove a premium charge or fee related to force-placed insurance for such period.

They asserted that it would not be reasonable for a servicer to absorb the cost of the refund if a borrower does not provide evidence of insurance in a timely manner or if a servicer had a reasonable basis to purchase force-placed insurance. Some commenters asserted that an unconditional right to a refund would encourage borrowers to act irresponsibly by not providing evidence of insurance in a timely manner. One state housing finance agency and a force-placed insurance provider suggested that servicers needed 15 business days to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a borrower with refunds in an orderly manner and asked the Bureau to adjust the timelines accordingly.",

While a number of commenters indicated that they understood \u201creceiving verification that the borrower has hazard insurance in place\u201d meant receiving evidence of insurance coverage, just as the Bureau has adjusted the text of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.37(c)(1)(iii), (d)(2)(ii), and (e)(1)(iii), to clarify what \u201creceiving verification\u201d means, the Bureau has made similar revisions to enhance the clarity of \u00a7 1024.37(g).", 
                        "Additionally, in finalizing \u00a7 1024.37(g)(2), the Bureau has replaced the proposed phrase \u201cfor any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance was in place\u201d with the phrase \u201cfor any period of overlapping insurance coverage\u201d because the Bureau believes the language \u201cperiods of overlapping coverage\u201d more closely aligns with the statutory language \u201cany period during which the borrower's insurance coverage and the force-placed insurance coverage were each in effect\u201d in RESPA section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3). The Bureau is adopting new comment 37(g)(2)-1 to explain what &#8220;period of overlapping insurance coverage&#8221; means for purposes of &#167; 1024.37(g)(2). The Bureau, however, is not adopting proposed comment 37(g)-1 because upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that further elaboration on what a servicer must do to comply with &#167; 1024.37(g) is not required.", 
                        "With respect to commenters asserting that a borrower should not have an unconditional right to a full refund of force-placed insurance premiums and related fees paid by the borrower, the Bureau notes that section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3) of RESPA expressly establishes that a borrower's right to a full refund for any period during which the borrower's hazard insurance and the force-placed insurance were both in effect is an unconditional one. Moreover, based on consumer testing and other outreach, the Bureau is skeptical that the statutory regime will cause borrowers to be less diligent in responding to notices from their servicers asking them to provide evidence demonstrating insurance coverage and result in servicers having to absorb significant costs.", 
                        "As discussed above, across all rounds of testing, participants uniformly understood the timeliness of their response upon the receipt of force-placed insurance notices affected whether or not they would have to pay for force-placed insurance. All participants said they would take immediate action because they did not want to bear the expense of force-placed insurance.\n            The uniformity of the responses supports the Bureau's belief that the substantially higher cost of force-placed insurance provides borrowers with a natural incentive to provide their servicers with evidence of insurance coverage in a timely manner.", 
                        "Further, based on outreach the Bureau has done with force-placed insurance providers and servicers, as well as based on public statements made by these entities and comment letters the Bureau has received from industry, the Bureau observes that the typical force-placed insurance on the market provides for flat cancellation (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the force-placed insurance provider provides a full refund of force-placed insurance premiums paid by the borrower for any period of time where the force-placed insurance and the borrower's hazard insurance coverage were both in effect).\n            Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe that servicers will have to absorb significant costs.", 
                        "The Bureau further declines to adjust the timeline a servicer must follow to cancel fore-placed insurance and refund force-place premium charges and related fees paid by the borrower. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of the defined term \u201cDay\u201d in \u00a7 1024.31, the Bureau believes that Congress intended the term \u201cday\u201d by itself to mean a calendar day for purposes of RESPA. The 15-day timeline for cancellation and refund is expressly established by section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3) of RESPA.", 
                        "Further, based on the Bureau's outreach and public statements made by force-placed insurance providers and servicers, the Bureau understands that servicers' purchase of force-placed insurance is generally a rare occurrence. If the volume of force-placement is small to begin with, then the Bureau is skeptical that requiring servicers to follow the statutorily-prescribed timeline would overwhelm a servicer or otherwise impose too large of a burden. Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to deviate from the statutory-determined timeline set forth in section 6(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(3).", 
                        "A large force-placed insurance provider, a state trade association representing mortgage lenders, and a bank servicer expressed concern that \u00a7 1024.37(g), as proposed, would be construed as requiring a servicer to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a full refund even if a borrower's hazard insurance policy does not meet the loan contract's requirements. Although the Bureau does not believe that it was reasonable to construe proposed \u00a7 1024.37(g) to require a servicer to cancel force-placed insurance and provide a full refund even if a borrower's hazard insurance policy does not meet the loan contract's requirements, the Bureau believes that in any event, the commenters' concern is adequately addressed by \u00a7 1024.37(g), which, as adopted, clarifies that \u201creceiving verification\u201d in proposed \u00a7 1024.37(g) means receiving evidence demonstrating that the borrower has had hazard insurance in place that complies the loan contract's requirements to maintain hazard insurance.",

                        "Section 1463(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA section 6 by adding new section 6(m) to RESPA, which states that apart from charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance, all charges related to force-placed insurance imposed on the borrower by or through the servicer must be bona fide and reasonable. Proposed \u00a7 1024.37(h)(1) generally mirrored the statutory language by providing that except for charges subject to State regulation as the business of insurance and charges authorized by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, all charges related to force-placed insurance assessed to a borrower by or through the servicer must be bona fide and reasonable. Proposed \u00a7 1024.37(h)(2) would have provided that a bona fide and reasonable charge is a charge for a service actually performed that bears a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, and is not otherwise prohibited by applicable law.", 
                        "The Bureau noted in the proposal that the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 establishes that notwithstanding any Federal or State law, any servicer for a loan \u201csecured by improved real estate or a mobile home\u201d may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special flood hazard zone. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 42 U.S.C. 4012a(h). As discussed in the proposal and explained above, the Bureau was concerned about issuing regulations that would overlap with regulations issued pursuant to the FDPA, and believed that borrowers would be confused by receiving overlapping notices under the two regimes with respect to the same flood insurance policy. Accordingly, as discussed above, the Bureau used its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to exempt hazard insurance to protect against flood loss obtained by a servicer as required by the FDPA from the definition of force-placed insurance. Consistent with this exemption and for the same reasons, the Bureau believed that it was necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA's force-placed insurance provisions to use it authority under section 19(a) of RESPA to exempt charges authorized by the FDPA from proposed &#167; 1024.37(h). The Bureau received no comments on the exemption and is adopting this aspect of &#167; 1024.37(h)(1) as proposed.", 
                        "With respect to proposed \u00a7 1024.37(h)(2), which would have set forth the Bureau's proposed definition of \u201cbona fide and reasonable charge,\u201d the Bureau noted in the proposal that the Bureau believed it was important that servicers do not try to inflate the already-high cost of force-placed insurance by assessing charges to borrowers that are not for services actually performed, do not bear a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, or are prohibited by applicable law.", 
                        "One non-bank servicer commended the proposed definition of \u201cbona fide and reasonable charge\u201d and predicted that the Bureau's proposal would stop many of the abusive servicer practices that have damaged the industry's reputation over the past few years. But a national trade association representing the consumer credit industry contended that the proposed definition would create an ambiguous standard that would expose lenders to class action lawsuits and infringe on state insurance departments' sole authority to regulate insurance rates.", 
                        "Other comments received from a national trade association representing realtors and several consumer groups urged the Bureau to go further in regulating charges related to force-placed insurance that a servicer imposes on a borrower. The realtors association urged the Bureau to mandate affordable force-placed insurance premiums. One consumer group urged the Bureau to ban servicers or their affiliates from receiving any fee, commission, kickback, reinsurance contract, or any other thing of value for a force-placed insurance provider in exchange for purchasing force-placed insurance, and to prohibit a servicer from obtaining an amount of force-placed insurance coverage greater than the replacement cost value of the borrower's property. Two national consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should expressly exclude unreasonable costs and other costs unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance. Two other national consumer groups asserted that the Bureau should expressly exclude commissions or other compensation paid by a force-placed insurance provider or its agent to a servicer or any affiliate of the servicer, costs associated with insurance tracking, cost for activities for which a servicer is being reimbursed by the owner of the mortgage, costs associated with the administration of reinsurance programs, cost to subsidize unrelated servicer activities, and any cost that is not directly related to the provision of force-placed insurance. They also urged the Bureau to provide guidance about prohibited fees that is consistent with Fannie Mae's proposed changes to its servicing guidelines on force-placed insurance.\n            These commenters further asserted that State insurance regulators have no authority over a charge that a servicer imposes on a borrower for force-placed insurance because a servicer is not an entity regulated by state insurance regulators.", 
                        "After consideration of the comments submitted, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to finalize \u00a7 1024.37(h)(2) as proposed. The Bureau believes \u00a7 1024.37(h) appropriately implements RESPA 6(m)'s \u201cbona fide and reasonable\u201d requirement in a way that does not overlap with state insurance departments' authority to regulation insurance rates. Further, the Bureau believes \u00a7 1024.37(h) provides clear guidance for servicers by unambiguously prohibiting a servicer from charging a borrower for a service it did not perform, or charging a borrower a fee that does not bear a reasonable relationship to the servicer's cost of providing the service, or that would be otherwise prohibited by applicable law.", 
                        "With respect to the request that the Bureau should revise the definition of \u201cbona fide and reasonable charges\u201d to exclude unreasonable costs, other costs unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance, and cost to subsidize servicing activities unrelated to the provision of force-placed insurance, the Bureau believes that the proposed and final definition already exclude such charges.", 
                        "With respect to requests that the Bureau mandate affordable force-placed insurance premiums, prohibit servicers from receiving commission or similar fees or things of value, prohibit fees associated with the cost of administration of reinsurance programs or insurance tracking, the Bureau recognizes the concerns, but believes the provisions of \u00a7 1024.37 provide adequate safeguards to borrowers and consistent with the regulatory scheme mandated by Congress.", 
                        "With respect to the request that the Bureau prohibit servicers from charging borrowers for costs that could be reimbursed by the owner of the mortgage loan, the Bureau believes that where a servicer charges a borrower for first-placed insurance in accordance with the requirements under \u00a7 1024.37, it is reasonable for the borrower, rather than the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan, to bear the costs of such insurance. With respect to the request that the Bureau exclude costs not directly related to force-placed insurance from the definition of \u201cbona fide and reasonable charges,\u201d the Bureau believes that the bona fide and reasonable standard provides adequate protection to borrowers without distinguishing between whether a charge is \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d related to force-placed insurance. Such a standard would thus inject addition complexity without concomitant consumer benefit.", 
                        "With respect to the request that the Bureau provide guidance about prohibited fees that is consistent with Fannie Mae's proposed changes to its servicing guidelines, the Bureau carefully reviewed Fannie Mae's servicing announcement and concluded that it would not be appropriate to provide similar guidance. The draft guidance simply informs servicers that Fannie Mae no longer plans to reimburse a servicer for certain servicer expenses related to servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance and importantly, it offers no guidance on the charges a servicer may impose on a borrower with respect to a servicer's purchase of force-placed insurance. Additionally, the Bureau believes that the prohibitions and requirements with respect to force-placed insurance under \u00a7 1024.37 provide adequate protection to borrowers and that there is no reason to depart from the scheme established by Congress to regulate force-placed insurance by importing Fannie Mae's guidance regarding prohibited fees into the final rule.", 
                        "Lastly, with regard to the argument that no charge imposed by a servicer is subject to State regulation as the business of insurance because a servicer is not regulated by State insurance regulators, the Bureau believes the language of section 6(m) of RESPA clearly contemplates that servicers may pass through charges that are subject to State regulation as the business of insurance to a borrower, and the fact that such charge is passed through by the servicer does not mean that such charge is no longer subject to State regulation as the business of insurance. For the foregoing reasons, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(h)(2) as proposed."

The Bureau proposed &#167; 1024.37(i) to provide that if permitted by regulation under section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, a servicer subject to the requirements of &#167; 1024.37 may deliver to the borrower or place in the mail any notice required by &#167; 1024.37 together with the notice required by section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.",

One state consumer group expressed concern that a borrower might be confused if it receives a notice required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.37 and a notice required pursuant to the FDPA at the same time.

                        "Congress vested other Federal regulators with the authority to issue regulations under the FDPA, and thus, the Bureau cannot revise the content of notices required under the FDPA. With respect to potential confusion caused by receiving concurrent notices, the Bureau notes that it has excluded insurance required under the FDPA from the definition of force-placed insurance so that borrowers will not receive overlapping notices under \u00a7 1024.37 and the FDPA with respect to the same insurance policy. To the extent borrowers receive separate notices under \u00a7 1024.37 and the FDPA with respect to separate insurance policies, the Bureau further believes that borrowers will be able to distinguish the notices under the two regulatory schemes based on their content. The Bureau also observes that it has addressed compliance burden by permitting under final \u00a7 1024.37(i) that notices under the FDPA and \u00a7 1024.37 could be provided to borrowers in the same transmittal. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.37(i) as proposed, except with adjustment just described.

                                "In proposing \u00a7 1024.38, the Bureau relied on a number of authorities, including section 6(k)(1)(E) of RESPA. That provision, which was added by \u00a7 1463 of the Dodd-Frank Act as part of a broader set of servicing-related requirements, authorizes the Bureau to promulgate regulations \u201cappropriate to carry out the consumer protection purposes of [RESPA].\u201d In the proposal, the Bureau noted that \u00a7 1024.38 was further authorized under section 6(j)(3) of RESPA, as necessary to carry out section 6 of RESPA, and under section 19(a) of RESPA, as necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. Because rules issued under section 6 of RESPA, including under sections 6(k)(1) and 6(j)(3), are enforceable through private rights of action, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(2), which set forth a safe harbor under which a servicer would not violate proposed \u00a7 1024.38 unless it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to achieve any of the objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38. The Bureau believed that creating a pattern or practice threshold would significantly improve industry practices but not subject servicers to lawsuits with respect to, for example, a single lost document or filing error.", 
                                "The Bureau received many comments on the private liability suggested by the Bureau's reliance on its authority under section 6 of RESPA to propose \u00a7 1024.38. Numerous industry commenters expressed concern that authorizing \u00a7 1024.38 under section 6 of RESPA would create a private cause of action to enforce the provisions of the section. These commenters noted that the litigation risk created by the proposed rule would complicate compliance due to the potential for inconsistent judicial interpretations of the rule. In light of this concern, industry commenters asked the Bureau to provide detailed, specific guidance on how to comply with the objectives set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.38. In addition, servicers argued that the Bureau and prudential regulators are better positioned to assess and supervise servicers' internal policies and procedures than courts through civil litigation. Industry commenters also stressed that the private litigation that would likely ensue under proposed \u00a7 1024.38 would increase the cost of servicing and thereby decrease the availability of credit.", 
                                "Consumer group commenters generally supported the allowance of private rights of action to enforce \u00a7 1024.38 but expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed safe harbor, which they argued should be eliminated or revised to reduce the barriers to successful civil actions and to ensure sufficient protection for borrowers. They commented that the safe harbor definition would make it difficult for consumers to bring successful civil suits, and urged the Bureau to eliminate or to revise the safe harbor to provide relief for more borrowers. Consumer advocates argued that borrowers need strong protections because borrowers cannot select their servicers.", 
                                "As stated in the proposal, the Bureau is concerned that a servicer's failure to achieve each of the objectives and standard requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 creates the potential for adverse consequences harmful to borrowers. These may include imposing improper fees on borrowers, inability reasonably to evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options that may benefit borrowers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans, unwarranted costs to borrowers, and the potential for fraud upon courts through inaccurate or unverifiable legal pleadings.", 
                                "The Bureau sought to balance the need for consumer protections with the costs created by command-and-control regulation by proposing objectives-based policies and procedures that allowed servicers flexibility to set policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain defined objectives. Because a single failure to achieve a desired objective or requirement is not necessarily indicative of a servicer's failure to implement appropriate policies and procedures and in light of the potential costs of civil litigation, the Bureau proposed a safe harbor under which servicers would be liable only for systemic violations of \u00a7 1024.38. Upon consideration of the comments and further consideration, however, the Bureau has concluded that the proposed formulation would not have adequately balanced the countervailing concerns of borrowers and industry. Requiring a showing of a pattern or practice could make it difficult for borrowers or regulators to obtain remedies until a servicer had inflicted widespread harm among its borrowers. At the same time, the prospect that many individual suits could be filed could threaten to undermine the basic goal of an objectives-based system, if servicers felt pressured to adopt models to reduce risk that were not in fact appropriately tailored to their particular operations.", 
                                "Ultimately, the Bureau agrees with the commenters that allowing a private right of action for the provisions that set forth general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements would create significant litigation risk. As the commenters noted, courts potentially would interpret the proposed flexible objectives-based standards inconsistently, which would have created compliance challenges for servicers. To address such challenges, the Bureau believes that it would have needed to issue more prescriptive standards in the final rule. The Bureau continues to believe, however, for the reasons discussed above, that flexible objectives-based standards are best suited to address the information management and other servicing challenges faced by different servicers that the Bureau identified in the proposal. Policies and procedures best suited to achieve the desired objectives are often highly dependent on the facts and circumstances of an individual servicer, such as the number and type of loans being serviced, and the technology that the servicer has deployed.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that supervision and enforcement by the Bureau and other Federal regulators for compliance with and violations of \u00a7 1024.38 respectively, would provide robust consumer protection without subjecting servicers to the same litigation risk and concomitant compliance costs as civil liability for asserted violations of \u00a7 1024.38. Indeed, the Bureau believes that the Bureau and other Federal regulators have the experience and judgment necessary to evaluate a servicer's compliance with \u00a7 1024.38 and to take action against servicers whose operational systems are not reasonably designed to achieve the stated objectives without waiting for evidence of a pattern or practice of undesirable outcomes. Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there was no comprehensive Federal supervisory authority over non-bank mortgage servicers. The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive regime of federal regulation over both bank and non-bank mortgage servicers. Under this new regime, the Bureau and other federal regulators can calibrate supervision to focus on practices that present the greatest risk to borrowers and work with servicers to assure that servicers have implemented effective systems that protect consumers and manage servicing portfolios. At the same time, the new comprehensive regulatory regime will allow the Bureau and other regulators to take prompt and effective action where a servicer's policies and procedures are deficient without waiting for proof of a pattern or practice of abuse.", 
                                "Therefore, the Bureau is restructuring the final rule so that it neither provides private liability for violations of \u00a7 1024.38 nor contains a safe harbor limiting liability to situations where there is a pattern or practice of violations. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has also revised some of the proposed objectives and added new requirements that the Bureau believes can be appropriately overseen by supervisory agencies but that would have been difficult for the courts to administer on a case-by-case basis. The Bureau believes that this approach more appropriately balances the need for robust consumer protections with respect to the general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 through supervision and enforcement by the Bureau and other agencies with the flexibility for industry to define how to achieve the important objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38.", 
                                "Thus, the Bureau no longer relies on its authorities under section 6 of RESPA to issue \u00a7 1024.38. Instead, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.38 pursuant to its authority under section 19(a) of RESPA. As explained in more detail below, the Bureau believes that the servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 are necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including to avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, to ensure that servicers are responsive to consumer requests and complaints, to ensure that servicers provide and maintain accurate and relevant information about the mortgage loan accounts that they service, and to facilitate the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. The Bureau believes that without sound operational policies and procedures and without achieving certain standard requirements, servicers will not be able to achieve those purposes. The Bureau is also adopting \u00a7 1024.38 pursuant to its authority under section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and objectives of Federal consumer financial laws. Specifically, the Bureau believes that \u00a7 1024.38 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objective under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances."

                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Background.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau proposed rules that would amend Regulation X to implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA and RESPA, with respect to among other things, error resolution and information requests. The Bureau also proposed to use its section 19(a) authority to require servicers to establish and to implement reasonable policies and procedures to manage information and documents, to evaluate and respond to loss mitigation applications, and to achieve other important objectives.", 
                        "As described more fully above, the Bureau's proposal sought to address pervasive consumer protection problems across major segments of the mortgage servicing industry that came to light during the recent financial crisis and that underlie many consumer complaints and recent regulatory and enforcement actions. In the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau stated that it believed that many servicers simply had not made the investments in resources and infrastructure necessary to service large numbers of delinquent loans. The Bureau noted that recent evaluations of mortgage servicer practices have indicated that borrowers have been harmed as a result of many servicers' lacking adequate policies and procedures to provide servicer personnel with appropriate borrower information. Federal regulatory agencies reviewing mortgage servicing practices have found that certain servicers demonstrated \u201csignificant weaknesses in risk-management, quality control, audit, and compliance practices.\u201d\n            \n          ", 
                        "Further, the Bureau noted that major servicers demonstrated systemic failures to document and verify, in accordance with applicable law, information relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts in connection with foreclosure proceedings. Examinations by prudential regulators found \u201ccritical deficiencies in foreclosure governance processes, document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third parties * * * [a]ll servicers [examined] exhibited similar deficiencies, although the number, nature, and severity of deficiencies varied by servicer.\u201d\n            \n          ", 
                        "As the Bureau explained in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, a servicer's obligation to maintain accurate and timely information regarding a mortgage loan account and to be able to provide accurate and timely information to its own employees and to borrowers, owners, assignees, subsequent servicers, and courts, among others, is one of the most basic servicer duties. A servicer cannot comply with its myriad obligations to investors and applicable law, unless it maintains sound systems to manage the servicing of mortgage loan accounts, including information systems that maintain accurate and timely information with respect to mortgage loan accounts. To address those critical concerns, the Bureau decided to use RESPA section 19(a) authority to propose a rule to address servicers' information management and other general servicing policies and procedures across the industry.", 
                        "The Bureau received general comments about whether it was appropriate for the Bureau to regulate servicers' practices related to information management and other servicer policies and procedures identified in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal. Consumer group comments generally demonstrated support for the proposal. Industry comments, on the other hand, expressed skepticism about whether it is necessary for the Bureau to regulate servicers' information management and other operational practices. Some industry comments suggested that recent State and Federal remediation efforts, such as the National Mortgage Settlement, and other existing regulations obviated the need for any regulation by the Bureau. Some servicers also urged the Bureau to delay adopting the proposed rule. The Bureau also received a small number of comments about the scope of the rule, including whether the proposed rule would apply to mortgages other than federally regulated mortgages or to reverse mortgages.", 
                        "In light of the potential harm to borrowers due to the deficiencies in servicer practices highlighted in the proposal, the Bureau continues to believe that servicers should achieve certain critical general servicing objectives and requirements. The Bureau declines to adopt the commenters' suggestions that regulation of these practices is not necessary at this time, and is adopting \u00a7 1024.38, as proposed with the modifications discussed in detail below. Through enforcement and supervision of \u00a7 1024.38, the Bureau will evaluate whether servicers are achieving the objectives and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38. The Bureau also expects that servicers will measure their own ability to achieve the objectives and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38. In addition, the Bureau expects that servicers' policies and procedures will address the core functions that they need to achieve those objectives and requirements, including providing adequate staffing and meaningful oversight of the resources engaged in achieving those important objectives and requirements, including servicer staff, service providers, and vendors.", 
                        "As explained above, the Bureau believes that the general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protective purposes of RESPA, including to avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees, to ensure that servicers are responsive to consumer requests and complaints, to ensure that servicers provide and maintain accurate and relevant information about the mortgage loan accounts that they service, and to facilitate the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Moreover, as discussed in detail below in part VII, the Bureau believes that the burden imposed on servicers under the final rule is reasonable in light of the countervailing benefits of the provisions.\n          ", 
                        "As discussed in detail above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.30, \u00a7 1024.38 applies only to the servicing of federally related mortgage loans, as defined in \u00a7 1024.2, and does not apply to the servicing of reverse mortgages, as defined in \u00a7 1024.31, or with respect to any mortgage loan for which a servicer is subject to regulation by the Farm Credit Administration as a \u201cqualified lender,\u201d as defined in 12 CFR 617.7000. In addition, \u00a7 1024.38 does not apply to small servicers, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4). The Bureau has also modified the final rule to clarify that the policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 are broader than information management and encompass general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(1) would have required servicers to establish reasonable policies and procedures for achieving certain objectives relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts. Proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(1) provided that a servicer meets this requirement if the servicer's policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve certain objectives, which are set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b), and are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with certain specific requirements in proposed \u00a7 1024.38(c).", 
                        "Proposed comment 38(a)-1 would have clarified that the proposed rule permits servicers to determine the specific methods by which they will implement reasonable policies and procedures to achieve the required objectives. The proposed comment also explained that servicers have flexibility to design the operations that are reasonable in light of the size, nature, and scope of the servicer's operations, including, for example, the volume and aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced, the credit quality, including the default risk, of the mortgage loans serviced, and the servicer's history of consumer complaints. The Bureau noted in the proposal that it intended that this clarification would provide servicers flexibility to design policies and procedures that are appropriate for their servicing businesses.", 
                        "The Bureau received a handful of comments on the structure of the requirements. Industry commenters, especially credit unions, were generally supportive of framing the requirements as objectives-based standards. A trade association expressed support for the flexibility included in the rule, but noted concern that examiners may not view servicers' programs flexibly and instead may ask servicers to change existing programs based on unpublished rules. A consumer group commented that framing the requirements as objectives-based standards would lead to inconsistent practices throughout the mortgage servicing industry.", 
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.38(a), which is re-numbered from proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(1), as proposed with non-substantive modifications. The Bureau believes that, due to diversity of servicer size, infrastructure, and work practices, flexible objectives-based standards are best-suited to manage servicers' operational practices. The Bureau understands as the commenters suggest that framing the requirements as objectives-based standards will lead to differences between how servicers implement the objectives, but believes that objectives-based standards best balance the burden on the industry with the protections for consumers.", 
                        "The Bureau is adopting comment 38(a)-1, as proposed with non-substantive modifications to explain that a servicer may determine the specific policies and procedures it will adopt and the methods by which it will implement those policies and procedures so long as they are reasonably designed to achieve the objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38(b). A servicer has flexibility to determine such policies and procedures and methods in light of the size, nature, and scope of the servicer's operations, including, for example, the volume and aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced, the credit quality, including the default risk, of the mortgage loans serviced, and the servicer's history of consumer complaints. Comment 38(a)-1 clarifies that servicers may retain existing procedures or design policies and procedures that are appropriately tailored to their operations, as long as the procedures are reasonably designed to achieve the important objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38(b). The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(a)-2 to clarify the meaning of the term procedures. As stated in the comment, the term \u201cprocedures\u201d refers to the actual practices followed by a servicer for achieving the objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38(b). This comment clarifies that the Bureau expects that servicers' policies and procedures will be reasonably designed to measure their ability to achieve the objectives set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 and to make ongoing improvements to their policies and procedures to address any deficiencies.", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Safe harbor.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau proposed &#167; 1024.38(a)(2) to provide a safe harbor for servicers for non-systemic violations of &#167; 1024.38 to manage the costs that would arise from the contemplated litigation risk created by the contemplated civil liability for violations of &#167; 1024.38. Proposed &#167; 1024.38(a)(2) stated that a servicer satisfies the requirement in proposed &#167; 1024.38(a)(1) if the servicer does not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to achieve any of the objectives set forth in proposed &#167; 1024.38(b) and did not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to comply with any of the standard requirements in proposed &#167; 1024.38(c). Proposed comment 38(a)(1)-1 would have provided examples of potential pattern or practice failures by servicers. Proposed comment 38(a)(2)-1 would have provided further clarification about the operation of the safe harbor.", 
                        "Comments received by the Bureau expressed uniform dissatisfaction with the proposed safe harbor definition. Industry commenters in general expressed the concern that the proposed safe harbor would not sufficiently insulate them from the large costs that they said that they would bear due to the litigation risk they saw embedded in the proposal as a result of civil liability, as discussed above in the section-by-section discussion of the legal authority for \u00a7 1024.38. In addition, some industry commenters stated that the safe harbor provision, which is based on the lack of a pattern or practice, would lead to costly discovery because servicers would be required to produce large volumes of documents to establish the absence of a pattern or practice.", 
                        "Consumer group commenters also expressed opposition to the proposed safe harbor. They commented that the safe harbor definition would make it difficult for borrowers to bring successful civil suits, and urged the Bureau to eliminate or to revise the safe harbor to provide relief for more borrowers. Consumer advocates argued that borrowers need strong protections because borrowers cannot select their servicers.", 
                        "As discussed above, the Bureau is adopting final general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements that are not enforceable through a private right of action. As violations of this \u00a7 1024.38 no longer carry potential civil liability, the Bureau does not believe that the proposed safe harbor is appropriate to include in the final rule. The Bureau is adopting a final rule that does not include proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(2) or proposed comments 38(a)(1)-1 and 38(a)(2)-1. This revision will also allow the Bureau to protect borrowers through robust supervision and enforcement of the servicing policies, procedures, and requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 without having to demonstrate a pattern or practice of violations."

The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to protect borrowers from harms resulting from servicers' failure to submit accurate, current, and compliant documents in foreclosure proceedings. In issuing the proposed rule, the Bureau pointed to findings by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that major servicers demonstrated failures to document and verify, in accordance with applicable law, information relating to borrower mortgage loan accounts in connection with foreclosure proceedings.\n            \n          ",

State attorneys general commented that the Bureau should adopt stricter standards to ensure the accuracy and validity of foreclosure documentation, such as the standards included in the recent National Mortgage Settlement. In addition, consumer groups urged the Bureau to require servicers who are initiating a foreclosure to provide documentation to borrowers of the right of the party initiating the action to foreclose, including providing evidence of an enforceable security interest and verification of supporting statements.", 
                        "After consideration of the comments, the Bureau has concluded that the proposed language already appropriately addresses the concerns raised. Section 1024.38(b)(1)(v), as proposed, requires servicers to develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring the accuracy of any documents filed in foreclosure proceedings, which would include affidavits or security instruments, and, therefore, is broad enough to cover the specific documents identified in the National Mortgage Settlement. Specifying particular documents which must be submitted accurately, or regulating the particulars of how documents are prepared and validated by servicers, would be inconsistent with the rule's broad objectives-based standards, which, as discussed above, are designed to provide flexibility for a wide range of servicers to develop policies and procedures that are appropriate to their business and that will achieve the stated objectives. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to adopt a final rule containing the specific details included in the National Mortgage Settlement. The Bureau expects that the court filings of servicers whose operational and information management policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve the objective of \u00a7 1024.38(b)(1)(v) will be accurate and authorized by the underlying security documents.",

Specifically, \u00a7 1024.36, as proposed, requires servicers to provide to borrowers upon their request information about their mortgage loan accounts, including their servicing files, which includes a complete payment history, a copy of their security instrument, collection notes, and other valuable information about their accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to revise the proposed language to provide this protection.

Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2) would have required that a servicer's policies and procedures be reasonably designed to achieve the objective of enabling the servicer to (i) provide accurate information to borrowers regarding loss mitigation options; (ii) identify all loss mitigation options for which a borrower may be eligible; (iii) provide servicer personnel with prompt access to all documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation option; (iv) enable servicer personnel to identify documents and information that a borrower is required to submit to make a loss mitigation application complete; and (v) enable servicer personnel to evaluate borrower applications properly, and any appeals, as appropriate.",

Absent regulation, servicers that have not yet invested in improving loss mitigation functions may find less incentive to do so as housing markets recover, leading to continued inadequate infrastructure during future regional or national housing downturns, which may lead to future borrower harm.

Consumer advocates supported proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2), and urged the Bureau to specify that servicers are required to provide borrowers with a list of available loss mitigation options. Trade associations urged the Bureau to clarify servicers' obligations in this section, in particular whether servicers could limit the information provided to borrowers to only the loss mitigation programs that the servicer offers. The Bureau also received many comments about the servicers' obligations to offer loss mitigation options to borrowers, which are discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.41.", 
                        "For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7\u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iv), as proposed with slight modifications for clarification. Section 1024.38(b)(2)(ii) clarifies that the rule envisions that servicers will develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify with specificity all loss mitigation options available for mortgage loans currently serviced by a mortgage servicer and that the mortgage servicer may service in the future. The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(b)(2)(ii)-1, which explains that servicers must develop policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable servicer personnel to identify all loss mitigation options available for mortgage loans currently serviced by the mortgage servicer. For example, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how a servicer specifically identifies, with respect to each owner or assignee, all of the loss mitigation options that the servicer may consider when evaluating any borrower for a loss mitigation option and the criteria that should be applied by a servicer when evaluating a borrower for such options. In addition, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how the servicer will apply any specific thresholds for eligibility for a particular loss mitigation option established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> if the owner or assignee requires that a servicer only make a particular loss mitigation option available to a certain percentage of the loans that the servicer services for that owner or assignee, then the servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to determine in advance how the servicer will apply that threshold to those mortgage loans). A servicer's policies and procedures must also be reasonably designed to ensure that such information is readily accessible to the servicer personnel involved with loss mitigation, including personnel made available to the borrower as described in &#167; 1024.40.", 
                        "To meet the objectives of \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(ii), a servicer will have to establish policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to provide servicer personnel with the ability to determine, on a loan by loan basis, which loss mitigation options made available by the servicer are available to particular borrowers and to provide that information to such borrowers. This objective requires that servicers have access to accurate information about the available loss mitigation options for particular types of loans. The Bureau anticipates that for servicers that service mortgage loans held by the servicer or an affiliate in portfolio, providing access to the latter category of information will not present significant burdens with respect to such mortgage loans as any such policies likely will be uniformly set forth by the servicer or affiliate. Similarly, the Bureau anticipates that servicers that service mortgage loans that are included in securitizations guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae, or insured by FHA or other government sponsored insurance programs, will be familiar with policies that will be set forth by those entities regarding the requirements for loss mitigation options and will be able to make that information available to servicer personnel and borrowers. Servicers that service mortgage loans that are securitized through private label securities may need to undertake more detailed discussions with investors to identify which, if any, loss mitigation programs made available by the servicer are available to borrowers whose mortgage loans are owned by the securitization trust pursuant to the terms of any particular servicing agreement. However, the Bureau believes the burden is still reasonable and will abate over time as the industry does a better job of clarifying such issues at the time that the servicing agreements are first drafted.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that the final rule will increase protection for borrowers by requiring servicers to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicers consider, in advance of the potential delinquency of a particular mortgage loan, the loss mitigation options that are generally available to borrowers. Further, the final rule provides a basis for Bureau supervision and enforcement regarding whether servicers are unjustifiably asserting investor limitations as a basis for avoiding the work of processing loss mitigation applications.",

As explained in the proposal, borrowers who are struggling to pay their mortgage have a vital interest in being properly considered for all available loss mitigation options, and the ability of servicers to do so is largely dependent upon servicers establishing and implementing policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assure that servicer personnel have prompt and complete access to all relevant information, including documents and information submitted by the borrowers. Proposed &#167; 1024.41, as discussed below, in turn defined procedures for evaluating loss mitigation applications.", 
                        "Most of the comments received by the Bureau regarding proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v) focused on the procedures set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.41. However, in light of the comments received, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v), with modifications from the proposal to make clear that the objective of proper evaluation of a borrower's application for a loss mitigation option, or any appeal, extends to all loss mitigation options that are potentially available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. As explained below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.41, this objective is not inconsistent with the use of a waterfall of loss mitigation options that an investor or assignee may establish.", 
                        "The Bureau is also adopting new comment 38(b)(2)(v)-1 to clarify that a servicer is required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v) to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option consistent with any owner or assignee requirements, even where the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 may be inapplicable. For example, an owner or assignee may require that a servicer implement certain procedures to review a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower less than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. Further, an owner or assignee may require that a servicer implement certain procedures to re-evaluate a borrower who has demonstrated a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances for a loss mitigation option after the servicer's initial evaluation. A servicer must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement these requirements even if such loss mitigation evaluations may not be required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau believes that the final rule will provide borrowers with greater access to loss mitigation options and more transparency into the evaluation process."

The Bureau stated that it believes it is appropriate for servicers to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of ensuring that in the event of any such transfer, documents and information regarding mortgage loan accounts are identified and transferred to a transferee servicer in a manner that permits the transferee servicer to continue providing appropriate service to the borrower.", 
                        "The Bureau requested comments regarding whether the Bureau had identified the appropriate objectives and whether objectives should be removed, or other objectives included, in the requirements. The Bureau received a small number of comments on proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4). Consumer advocates and some industry expressed support for the proposal. Other commenters asked for clarification about what the proposal would require, including whether transferor servicers must transfer all of the servicing file elements and whether the rule would require transferor servicers to obtain documents outside of the transferor servicers' possession or control. Servicers also asked for clarification about whether the rule would allow servicers to transfer files electronically.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau has received information that consumers often face difficulty enforcing a loss mitigation agreement reached with a transferor servicer prior to transfer with the transferee servicer. The Bureau has learned that transferee servicers often fail to request complete information about loss mitigation agreements from transferor servicers, and instead require borrowers to provide that documentation.", 
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4)(i), renumbered from proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4), with modifications to address those comments. The Bureau has revised the proposal to add language to clarify that a transferor servicer's objectives regarding facilitating transfer relate only to documents within the transferor servicer's possession or control and that the transfer of information and documents must be in a form and manner that enables a transferee servicer to comply with obligations both under the terms of the mortgage loan and with applicable law. The Bureau is also removing the language concerning the transfer of information regarding loss mitigation discussions with borrowers from the text of proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4) and, instead, is including new comment 38(b)(4)(i)-2, which clarifies the transferor servicer's obligation under \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4)(i) to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the transfer includes any information reflecting the current status of discussions with a borrower regarding loss mitigation options, any agreements entered into with a borrower on a loss mitigation option, and any analysis by a servicer with respect to potential recovery from a non-performing mortgage loan, as appropriate.", 
                        "To address industry's comments about the manner in which transferor servicers may effectuate the transfer of documents and information, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(4)(i)-1, which clarifies that a transferor servicer's policies and procedures may provide for transferring documents and information electronically provided that the transfer is conducted in a manner that is reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy of the information and documents transferred and that enables a transferee servicer to comply with its obligations to the owner or assignee of the loan and with applicable law. For example, transferor servicers must have policies and procedures for ensuring that data can be properly and promptly boarded by a transferee servicer's electronic systems and that all necessary documents and information are available to, and can be appropriately identified by, a transferee servicer.", 
                        "The Bureau is also adopting \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4)(ii) to more clearly define objectives for transferee servicers. Section 1024.38(b)(4)(ii) defines as an objective of a transferee servicer's reasonable policies and procedures identifying necessary documents or information that may not have been transferred by a transferor servicer and obtaining such documents from the transferor servicer. Comment 38(b)(4)(ii)-1 explains that a transferee servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure, in connection with a servicing transfer, that the servicer receives information regarding any loss mitigation discussions with a borrower, including any copies of loss mitigation agreements. Further, the comment clarifies that the transferee servicer's policies and procedures must address obtaining any such missing information or documents from a transferor servicer before attempting to obtain such information from a borrower.",

When issuing the proposed rule, the Bureau observed that proposed \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 would have required servicers to respond to notices of error and information requests provided up to one year after a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer. The Bureau also noted that it believes that the record retention requirement was necessary for servicer compliance with obligations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36. The Bureau also proposed to eliminate the systems of record keeping set forth in current \u00a7 1024.17(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>), which required servicers to retain copies of documents related to borrower's escrow accounts for five years after the servicer last serviced the escrow account, which is likely to be close in time to when a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer. Further, the Bureau observed that servicers will require accurate information for the life of the mortgage loan to provide accurate payoff balances to borrowers or to exercise a right to foreclose. The Bureau requested comment regarding whether servicers should be required to retain documents and information relating to a mortgage file until one year after a mortgage loan is paid in full or servicing of a mortgage loan is transferred to a successor servicer and the potential burden of this requirement.",

Consumer advocates urged the Bureau to extend the retention period from one year to five years to ensure that documents were available for discovery in civil litigation. Two servicers argued that the one year retention period would impose too great a cost on servicers. Another servicer commented that it agreed with the proposed one year retention period. A trade association also urged the Bureau to clarify that contractual rights to access records possessed by another entity would satisfy the servicer's requirements under this provision.",

As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the record retention requirement is necessary for servicer compliance with obligations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36. Further, the Bureau believes that servicers require accurate information for the life of the mortgage loan to provide accurate payoff balances to borrowers or to exercise a right to foreclose. Requiring servicers to retain records until one year after the transfer or payoff of a mortgage loan may impose some marginal increase in the servicer's compliance burden in the form of incremental storage costs, but the Bureau believes that this burden is reasonable in light of the considerable benefits to borrowers. Moreover, the retention period is necessary to ensure that the Bureau and other regulators have an opportunity to supervise servicers' compliance with applicable laws effectively. The Bureau declines to adopt the longer period suggested by commenters. The Bureau believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenters' concerns about the availability of documents for discovery by requiring retention of documents throughout the life of the loan and for one year following the payoff or transfer of servicing.",

Industry commenters generally misunderstood the proposed provision as a requirement to provide borrowers with copies of their servicing files not subject to the procedures for information requests set forth in \u00a7 1024.36. Some servicers explicitly urged the Bureau to subject requests for servicing files to the procedural requirements of the information requests defined in \u00a7 1024.36. In addition, given this misunderstanding, industry comments urged the Bureau to adopt limits on borrowers' requests for servicing files to protect servicers from burdensome or duplicative requests. Servicers also suggested that the Bureau eliminate certain elements of the servicing file, such as payment histories, collection notes, and data fields, because they claimed that those elements would be too voluminous to provide to borrowers. A large servicer also urged the Bureau to allow flexibility in how servicers provide the information to borrowers, such as allowing borrowers to access the servicing file via a Web site.",

Instead, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(c)(2)-2 that clarifies that \u00a7 1024.38(c)(2) does not confer upon any borrower an independent right to access information contained in the servicing file and that upon receipt of a borrower's request for a servicing file, a servicer shall provide the borrower with a copy of the information contained in the servicing file for the borrower's mortgage loan, subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in \u00a7 1024.36.

Some of these commenters explained that their existing information systems stored some of the elements of the servicing file in separate systems. Some of these commenters also stated that their existing systems had not led to problems identified in the proposal, and urged the Bureau not to mandate that servicers with sound existing information management systems rebuild those systems to satisfy the technical details in the regulation.", 
                        "The intent of the servicing file requirement in proposed \u00a7 1024.38(c)(2) was to prevent harm to borrowers and to investors by requiring servicers to have the capacity to access key information about a mortgage loan quickly.

Some servicers commented that the Bureau should limit the payment history requirement due to the costs associated with maintaining a payment history for the life of the mortgage loan, especially with respect to partial payments. A large servicer urged the Bureau to delay implementation of this proposed provision to allow the Bureau to test what fields should be contained in a servicing file. Industry comments also noted that some servicers' existing files do not contain all of the required elements.",

Therefore, the Bureau declines to remove any of the proposed elements from the servicing file definition. Also, the flexibility added to the final rule for servicers to determine how best to store the elements of the servicing file reduces the implementation burden on servicers.

Comment 38(c)(2)(iv)-1 also provides examples of data fields relating to a borrower's mortgage loan account created by the servicer's electronic systems in connection with servicing practices including fields used to identify the terms of the borrower's mortgage loan, fields used to identify the occurrence of automated or manual collection calls, fields reflecting the evaluation of a borrower for a loss mitigation option, fields used to identify the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, and any credit reporting history.

                                "Proposed \u00a7 1024.39 would have required servicers to provide delinquent borrowers with two notices. First, proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a), would have required servicers to notify or make good faith efforts to notify a borrower orally that the borrower's payment is late and that loss mitigation options may be available, if applicable. Servicers would have been required to take this action not later than 30 days after the payment due date, unless the borrower satisfied the payment during that period. Second, proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b) would have required servicers to provide a written notice with information about the foreclosure process, housing counselors and the borrower's State housing finance authority, and, if applicable, information about loss mitigation options that may be available to the borrower. Servicers would have been required to provide the written notice not later than 40 days after the payment due date, unless the borrower satisfied the payment during that period. These two notices were designed primarily to encourage delinquent borrowers to work with their servicer to identify their options for avoiding foreclosure.", 
                                "While a number of industry commenters supported the overall objective of encouraging communication between servicers and delinquent borrowers, many commenters, particularly small servicers, requested that the Bureau not issue regulations that are not required by the express provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, citing compliance burden and the potential for overwhelming and confusing borrowers. Some industry commenters were concerned that the breadth of the definition of \u201cLoss mitigation options\u201d would require servicers to offer options or take actions inconsistent with investor or guarantor requirements. One industry commenter suggested, as an alternative to early intervention, that all borrowers be required to receive education about mortgages earlier in the process, before they become delinquent. Another stated that the Bureau's early intervention requirements would be ineffective because borrowers would not open mail or respond to phone calls.", 
                                "Consumer advocacy groups were uniformly in favor of both an oral and written notice requirement. One consumer advocacy group explained that an oral and written notice requirement would help homeowners identify late payments quickly and engage in loss mitigation earlier to avoid foreclosure. Several consumer advocacy groups who submitted a joint comment stated that the Bureau was justified in proposing early intervention, explaining that early intervention is already an industry norm under GSE guidelines, the National Mortgage Settlement, and HAMP, which have standards for multiple phone calls and written notices at the early stages of a delinquency. These commenters also cited research that showed borrowers have a lower re-default rate the earlier they are reached in their delinquency.", 
                                "However, most consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau require servicers to provide more information about the foreclosure process and loss mitigation options than the Bureau had proposed to require. Many consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau require servicers to provide information about all loss mitigation options potentially available to borrowers through the proposed oral and written notices. One mortgage investor commenter supported the Bureau's policy goal of requiring servicers to engage more actively with delinquent borrowers about loss mitigation options. This commenter also recommended that the final rule require that servicers maintain adequate staffing levels with respect to delinquent loans, maintain frequent contact with borrowers to remind borrowers of available options, review them for such options, and provide a user-friendly and up-to-date Web site on which borrowers could locate servicer contact information.", 
                                "Industry commenters questioned whether the Bureau's rules were necessary in light of recent State and Federal remediation efforts, such as the National Mortgage Settlement and various consent agreements with bank regulators. One credit union trade association believed that the Bureau's proposed requirements were too rigid and would be ineffective, while another indicated that the early intervention requirements would not present issues because many of its affiliated members would be able to modify their current procedures without much difficulty. However, other industry trade associations and a nonprofit servicer indicated that, while most servicers already perform some form of early intervention, their programs are not identical to the Bureau's proposal, and that compliance would require adjustments to or formalization of servicer policies and procedures that may not necessarily be suited to a borrower's particular circumstances. Several industry commenters expressed concern that the Bureau's rules overlap and could conflict with existing State and Federal law.\n            With respect to addressing potential conflicts between the Bureau's rules and existing State and Federal law as well as existing industry practice, commenters identified a variety of ways the Bureau could provide relief, including by not adopting rules that exceed or otherwise conflict with existing requirements, providing safe harbors (such as by clarifying that compliance with existing laws and agreements satisfies 1024.39), adopting more flexible standards, providing exemptions, including a mechanism in the rule to resolve compliance conflicts, or broadly preempting State laws.", 
                                "Trade associations, smaller servicers, credit unions, and rural creditors subject to Farm Credit Administration rules generally requested exemptions from the early intervention requirements, citing a \u201chigh-touch\u201d customer service model, problems with internalizing compliance costs relative to larger servicers, and potential conflicts arising from complying with conflicting sets of rules. Small servicers and credit unions expressed concern that higher compliance costs would make it difficult to maintain high levels of customer service.\n            A reverse mortgage trade association requested an exemption from the early intervention requirements because of the unique nature of reverse mortgage products and because the majority of reverse mortgages made in the current market are FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgages already subject to specific requirements.", 
                                "The Bureau has considered the comments submitted but continues to believe that rules governing early intervention are warranted. As the Bureau explained in its proposal, the Bureau believes that a servicer's delinquency management plays a significant role in whether the borrower cures the delinquency or ends up in foreclosure.\n            For a variety of reasons, at least among the larger players, servicers have not been consistent in managing delinquent accounts to provide borrowers with an opportunity to avoid foreclosure. In addition, incentives remain that may discourage these larger servicers from addressing a delinquency quickly as servicers may profit from late fees.\n            The Bureau also explained that delinquent borrowers may not make contact with servicers to discuss their options because they may be unaware that they have options\n            or that their servicer is able to assist them.\n            There is risk to borrowers who do not make contact with servicers and remain delinquent; the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure.\n            By requiring early intervention with delinquent borrowers, the Bureau has sought to correct impediments to borrower-servicer communication so that borrowers have a reasonable opportunity to avoid foreclosure at the early stages of a delinquency. As the Bureau recognized in its proposal, not all delinquent borrowers may respond to servicer outreach or pursue available loss mitigation options. However, the Bureau believes that the notices will ensure, at a minimum, that covered borrowers have an opportunity to do so at the early stages of a delinquency.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule implements, among other things, RESPA section 5(c) requiring lenders to provide applicants of federally related mortgage loans with a list of homeownership counseling providers. Thus, borrowers will receive information to access counseling services at the time of application. In addition, the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule requires that applicants for \u201chigh cost\u201d mortgages receive counseling prior to obtaining credit. While pre-mortgage counseling will help ensure borrowers understand the costs involved in obtaining a mortgage, borrowers who become delinquent may not know that they have options for avoiding foreclosure unless the servicer notifies them.", 
                                "The Bureau understands that private lenders and investors, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Federal agencies, such as FHA and VA, already have early intervention servicing standards in place for delinquent borrowers.\n            However, servicers may vary as to how forthcoming they are in providing borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments with options other than to pay only what is owed. The Bureau's goal with respect to its early intervention requirements is to identify consumer protection standards that are now best practices but were not consistently applied during the recent financial crisis and to apply these across the market, subject to exemptions identified in \u00a7 1024.30(b) and the scope limitation of \u00a7 1024.30(c)(2), to ensure that servicers are providing delinquent borrowers with a meaningful opportunity to avoid foreclosure.", 
                                "In light of comments received on the proposal, the Bureau has revised the proposed early intervention requirements to provide servicers with additional flexibility. Proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) would have required servicers to notify, or make good faith efforts to notify, delinquent borrowers orally that loss mitigation options, if applicable, may be available by the 30th day of their delinquency. Under the proposal, servicers that make loss mitigation options available to borrowers would generally have been required to notify delinquent borrowers of the availability of such options not later than the 30th day of their delinquency.", 
                                "The final rule does not require servicers to provide this notice to all borrowers and does not require servicers to inform borrowers of options that are not available from the owner or investor. Instead, under \u00a7 1024.39(a), servicers must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with a delinquent borrower by the 36th day of the borrower's delinquency. Live contact includes telephoning or conducting an in-person meeting with the borrower. In addition, under \u00a7 1024.39(a), promptly after establishing live contact, servicers must inform the borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options if appropriate. Among other changes, the final rule includes commentary that clarifies that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether such a notice is appropriate under the circumstances. Commentary to the final rule also provides a more flexible good faith efforts standard that would permit servicers to comply by encouraging the borrower through written or electronic communication to make contact with the servicer. These changes are intended to help ensure servicers make efforts to contact delinquent borrowers who would be interested in learning about loss mitigation options and, at the same time, avoid causing servicers to spend resources notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options the servicer has reason to believe would not benefit from being informed of such options.", 
                                "The final rule includes a written notice requirement similar to the one proposed at \u00a7 1024.39(b), but the Bureau has sought to mitigate compliance burden without undermining the protection of an early written notice by extending the deadline for providing the notice from 40 to 45 days of a borrower's delinquency to align with other notices that servicers may already provide to borrowers at that time. The Bureau has sought to develop flexible early intervention requirements to accommodate existing practices and requirements to avoid servicers having to duplicate existing early intervention practices. For example, if servicers are required by other laws to provide a notice that includes the content required by \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) and if servicers may provide such notice within the first 45 days of a borrower's delinquency, the Bureau does not believe servicers would need to provide each notice separately.", 
                                "The Bureau has further sought to accommodate existing practices by providing clarifying commentary to \u00a7 1024.39(b)(1) that servicers may combine notices that may already meet the content requirements of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) into a single mailing. In addition, comment 39(b)(2)-1 explains that the written notice contains minimum content requirements for the written notice and that a servicer may provide additional information that the servicer determines would be helpful or which may be required by applicable law or the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan. The Bureau has included this comment, in part, to accommodate similar notices that servicers may already be providing. Further, to assist with compliance, the Bureau has also developed model clauses, which the Bureau has tested with the assistance of Macro. A servicer's appropriate use of the model clauses will act as a safe harbor for compliance.", 
                                "While the Bureau has designed its early intervention requirements to provide flexibility to servicers that already have early intervention practices in place or that are complying with external existing requirements, the Bureau acknowledges that some of the new requirements may not align perfectly with all existing practices. To address actual conflicts with State or Federal law, the Bureau has included new \u00a7 1024.39(c), which, as discussed in more detail below, provides that nothing in \u00a7 1024.39 shall require a servicer to make contact with a borrower in a manner that would be prohibited under applicable law. The Bureau believes this approach to conflicting laws is preferable to preempting other laws. Because \u00a7 1024.39 require servicers to proactively contact borrowers, the Bureau is concerned that preempting laws might override those that protect delinquent borrowers from certain contacts (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> debt collection laws).", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau is granting exemptions for small servicers as defined in 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4); servicers with respect to any reverse mortgage transaction as that term is defined in \u00a7 1024.31; and servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1024.30(b) above. The Bureau is further limiting the application of &#167;&#167; 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1024.30(c)(2) above.", 
                                "The Bureau is not mandating that servicers maintain specific staffing levels to perform early intervention with delinquent borrowers, but the Bureau notes that, under \u00a7 1024.38, servicers must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of properly evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options. The Bureau is not requiring servicers to maintain a Web site for delinquent borrowers to provide early intervention information because the Bureau believes such a requirement may be burdensome for all servicers and is unnecessary in light of the written notice at \u00a7 1024.39(b), which includes contact information for servicer continuity of contact personnel assigned pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(a).", 
                                "The Bureau declines to grant an exemption from the early intervention requirements with respect to borrowers who have ceased making payments for the past six months and have not contacted their servicer. To the extent loss mitigation options are available for such borrowers, the Bureau believes these borrowers should be so informed in accordance with \u00a7 1024.39(a) and (b). Further, the Bureau believes servicers should make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers who may be reluctant to reach out before taking action that may result in the loss of the borrower's home. In addition, the Bureau believes these borrowers would benefit from information about how to contact their servicer as well as information about how to access housing counseling resources."

Violations of section 6 of RESPA are subject to a private right of action. Industry commenters, including the GSEs, industry trade associations, and several large bank servicers were concerned that a private right of action would result in uncertainty for servicers and could delay loss mitigation efforts and the foreclosure process if a borrower claimed it did not receive a timely notice required by the Bureau's rules. Commenters indicated that increased litigation costs would limit access to and increase the cost of credit to borrowers. One commenter was concerned that a private right of action would result in loss mitigation being perceived as a substantive right. Instead, commenters requested that the Bureau issue the early intervention and other loss mitigation provisions solely in reliance on RESPA section 19(a) authority.", 
                                "The Bureau has considered industry comments but continues to rely on RESPA section 6 authority as a basis for the Bureau's early intervention requirements under \u00a7 1024.39. The Bureau does not believe \u00a7 1024.39 will result in loss mitigation being treated as a substantive right because it sets forth procedural requirements only. As finalized, \u00a7 1024.39 does not require servicers to offer any particular loss mitigation option to any particular borrower. The live contact requirement under \u00a7 1024.39(a) requires servicers to notify borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options \u201cif appropriate\u201d; associated commentary clarifies that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether it is appropriate to inform borrowers of such options. The written notice requirement under \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) requires servicers to inform borrowers, \u201cif applicable,\u201d of examples of loss mitigation options available through the servicer. Nothing in \u00a7 1024.39 affects whether a borrower is permitted as a matter of contract law to enforce the terms of any contract or agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau has taken steps to clarify requirements in the rule, which the Bureau believes will help avoid uncertainty for servicers and help minimize litigation risk and compliance costs arising from a private right of action associated with RESPA section 6. For example, the final rule omits the proposed oral notice requirement under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) and instead requires that servicers establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers and, promptly after establishing live contact, inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Comment 39(a)-3.i explains that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether informing a borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances; the comment also includes illustrative examples to assist with compliance. While this guidance should provide servicers with some degree of certainty around compliance, the Bureau recognizes there may be limited situations that are less clear; in these cases, however, servicers could avoid compliance risk by informing borrowers of loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.ii explains that a servicer may inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options either through an oral or written communication. The final rule also provides servicers with more flexibility in satisfying the good faith efforts standard; servicers may demonstrate compliance by providing written or electronic communication encouraging borrowers to establish live contact with their servicer. In addition, with respect to the written notice under \u00a7 1024.39(b), the final rule includes model clauses and clarifies in commentary that servicers may provide additional information about loss mitigation options not included in the model clauses. Further, the final rule includes flexible minimum content requirements for the written notice that will assist servicers in accommodating existing disclosures and other related disclosure requirements.", 
                                "The Bureau does not believe that the risk of a private right of action will negatively impact access to, or cost of, credit. The requirements under \u00a7 1024.39 include clear procedural requirements as well as protections for a servicer's exercise of reasonable discretion. Further, the requirements have been implemented to reduce compliance burden and provide clear rules capable of efficient implementation by servicers, including through the use of model clauses. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the early intervention rules under \u00a7 1024.39 provide necessary consumer protections and that servicers are capable of providing such protections without negative consequences for borrowers, including with respect to access to, or cost of, credit.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.39 pursuant to its authorities under sections 6(j)(3), 6(k)(1)(E), and 19(a) of RESPA. As explained in more detail below, the Bureau finds, consistent with RESPA section 6(k)(1)(E), that \u00a7 1024.39 is appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including to help borrowers avoid unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees and to facilitate review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. For the same reasons, \u00a7 1024.39 is authorized under section 6(j)(3) of RESPA as necessary to carry out section 6 of RESPA, and under section 19(a) of RESPA as necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA, including borrowers' avoidance of unwarranted or unnecessary costs and fees and the facilitation of review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options.",

Specifically, the Bureau believes that \u00a7 1024.39 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objectives under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information to make responsible decisions about financial transactions, and markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances. Consistent with section 1032(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the model clauses at appendix MS-4 have been validated through consumer testing."

Accordingly, in the final rule, the Bureau has developed a more flexible good faith efforts standard. Proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) would have provided that, if the servicer attempts to notify the borrower about loss mitigation options by telephone, good faith efforts would require calling the borrower on at least three separate days in order to reach the borrower. The final rule does not define good faith efforts to establish live contact by identifying a particular number of days to reach the borrower. Instead, comment 39(a)-2 clarifies that good faith efforts to establish live contact consist of reasonable steps under the circumstances to reach a borrower and may include telephoning the borrower on more than one occasion or sending written or electronic communication encouraging the borrower to establish live contact with the servicer.",

In addition, permitting servicers to satisfy the good faith efforts standard through written or electronic communication encouraging the borrower to establish live contact addresses servicer concerns about tracking and compliance risks associated with the proposed oral notice requirement.",

The Bureau is not requiring servicers to leave a voicemail message when such an option is available because such a requirement may implicate privacy concerns. The Bureau is not adopting a requirement mandating that servicers establish in-person contact or so-called \u201cfield calls\u201d to the borrower's residence. While such methods of contact may be effective methods of reaching delinquent borrowers, the Bureau believes telephone calls are equally, if not more effective in certain circumstances, and mandating an in-person contact requirement would be unduly burdensome for most servicers. Of course, a servicer could choose to establish live contact through in-person meetings."

In light of comments received, the Bureau is not adopting the 30-day timeframe in proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) and instead is adopting a requirement that a servicer establish live contact not later than the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency to determine whether to inform such borrower that loss mitigation options may be available.", 
                                                "Industry commenters stated that providing notices too early would be unnecessary for borrowers capable of curing a short-term delinquency or for borrowers at low risk of default, and that providing notice of loss mitigation, in such circumstances, may interfere with sound delinquency management. A variety of servicers and trade associations recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 40 or 45 days and one trade association recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 60 days to provide servicers with maximum flexibility. One industry commenter indicated that a 30-day timeframe would be burdensome for servicers that honor a 15-day grace period because it would only leave servicers only 15 days to satisfy the good faith efforts standard. Trade associations, community banks, and rural lenders were concerned that the Bureau's requirements might be duplicative of or not perfectly aligned with existing requirements. Some commenters requested that the Bureau create an exemption from the 30-day deadline for servicers that employ a behavior modeling tool. In contrast, consumer advocacy groups requested that the Bureau maintain the 30-day period and include more information in the oral notice. One consumer advocate recommended that borrowers be notified about their options as soon as their account is deemed delinquent by the servicer.", 
                                                "In the final rule, the Bureau is retaining a deadline by which a servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact, but the Bureau is adjusting the timing of the deadline from the 30-day period originally proposed to a 36-day period. As the Bureau recognized in its proposal, certain borrowers may be temporarily delinquent because of an accidental missed payment, a technical error in transferring funds, a short-term payment difficulty, or some other reason. These borrowers may be able to cure a delinquency without a servicer's efforts to make live contact. Thus, if the borrower fully satisfies the payment before the end of the 36-day period, the servicer would not be required to establish live contact or otherwise comply with \u00a7 1024.39(a). Proposed comment 39(a)-4 explained that a servicer would not be required to notify or make good faith efforts to notify a borrower unless the borrower remains late in making a payment during the 30-day period after the payment due date. A similar comment appears in 39(a)-1.iv, revised to reflect the new 36-day period.", 
                                                "As the Bureau noted in its proposal, there is risk to borrowers as a result of a delay in notifying borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available; research indicates that the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure.\n            At the same time, the Bureau understands that a significant portion of borrowers who become delinquent are able to self-cure within 30 days of a missed payment.", 
                                                "The government-sponsored enterprises generally recommend that servicers initiate phone calls for borrowers who have missed a payment by the 16th day after a payment due date, although calling campaigns for high-risk borrowers must begin by the third day after a due date.\n            In general, calls must occur every three days through day 36 of delinquency, and follow-up calls are required after borrower solicitation packages have been sent. Other standards, such as HAMP\n            and the National Mortgage Settlement,\n            typically provide for the commencement of outreach efforts to communicate loss mitigation options for potentially eligible borrowers after two missed payments. For FHA-insured mortgages, HUD has a general requirement to contact borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages by telephone between the 17th day of delinquency and the end of the month.\n            However, HUD Mortgagee Letter 98-18 provides that, at the lender's discretion following a formal risk assessment, borrowers with FHA loans at low risk for foreclosure may be contacted by phone by the 45th day of delinquency.", 
                                                "The Bureau is adjusting the timing by which a servicer must establish live contact from 30 to 36 days to be more consistent with GSE outbound call guidelines, HAMP, and the National Mortgage Settlement, and to give borrowers more time to cure a delinquency before a servicer attempts to establish live contact. In addition, a 36-day deadline would help servicers screen for delinquent borrowers who regularly pay late, by permitting servicers to identify borrowers at risk of missing two payment deadlines before attempting efforts to contact them. The Bureau understands that servicers may not be able to complete an initial eligibility evaluation prior to the deadline for contact (potentially within five days after a second missed payment due date). However, the Bureau's rule would only require servicers to establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers and inform such borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options promptly after establishing live contact \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Where a servicer determines that it would be appropriate to inform a borrower about the availability of such options, comment 39(a)-3.ii clarifies that a servicer need not notify borrowers about specific loss mitigation options under 1024.39(a), but only that loss mitigation options may be available. In addition, even if servicers have not completed an initial eligibility evaluation by the time of oral contact, the Bureau believes delinquent borrowers would still benefit from hearing about any other loss mitigation options for which they may be eligible. The Bureau believes a 36-day standard would be consistent with the Settlement terms requiring servicers to commence outreach efforts after the second missed payment. Under \u00a7 1024.39(a), servicers must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with borrowers by the 36th day of delinquency, which would occur after a second missed payment is due. Moreover, servicers need not inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options at the time of establishing live contact (if appropriate); \u00a7 1024.39(a) requires that they do so promptly after establishing live contact. The Bureau declines to adopt a requirement to contact borrowers as soon as they become delinquent because the Bureau believes such a requirement would be overbroad, as discussed above.", 
                                                "The Bureau declines to adopt a general 40- or 45-day standard for all borrowers because the Bureau believes borrowers who may be experiencing the early stages of a long-term delinquency are, on balance, likely to benefit from earlier contact, and the Bureau believes that by the 36th day of a delinquency, servicers would know whether a borrower has missed two payments (subject only to the possibility that the payment will be received before the expiration of the grace period for the second payment). The Bureau believes that borrowers who miss two payments generally will present a greater financial risk than borrowers who are only one month late. The Bureau believes servicers should be required to establish live contact, or make good faith efforts to do so, not later than several days after a borrower has missed a second payment due date so the servicer may begin to learn about the circumstances of a borrower's delinquency. Of course, servicers may elect to contact borrowers sooner, and the Bureau believes most servicers will do so pursuant to GSE, FHA, and VA guidelines. Finally, the Bureau declines to permit servicers to delay contact for borrowers identified as low-risk based on a servicer's use of a behavior modeling tool. The Bureau is concerned that modeling tools used to predict future behavior are inherently imprecise and produce a certain percentage of false negatives\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> borrowers who are predicted to self-cure but do not. As also discussed below, at this time, the Bureau does not have sufficient data to evaluate or validate such tools.",

The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 39(a)-5 or the two illustrative examples at proposed 39(a)-5.i.A or -5.i.B.

As explained in the proposal, the Bureau proposed this trigger because the Bureau believes there is low risk that borrowers will default solely because of accumulated late charges if they are otherwise current with respect to principal, interest, and escrow payments. The Bureau proposed to add comment 39(a)-3 to explain that, for purposes of proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a), a payment would be considered late the day after a payment due date, even if the borrower is afforded a grace period before the servicer assesses a late fee. Thus, for example, if a payment due date is January 1, the servicer would be required to notify or make good faith efforts to notify the borrower not later than 30 days after January 1 (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> by January 31) if the borrower has not fully paid the amount owed as of January 1 and the full payment remains due during that period.",

The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-1.i to clarify that, for purposes of \u00a7 1024.39, delinquency begins on the day a payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow for a given billing cycle is due and unpaid, even if the borrower is afforded a period after the due date to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee. For example, if a payment due date is January 1 and the amount due is not fully paid during the 36-day period after January 1, the servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact not later than 36 days after January 1\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> by February 6. Delinquency is calculated in a similar manner with respect to the written notice under &#167; 1024.39(b)(1) that must be provided by the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency.

Unlike proposed comment 39(b)(1)-2, comment 39(a)(1)-1.i does not use the term &#8220;grace period&#8221; but instead uses the phrase &#8220;period of time after the due date has passed to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee.&#8221; The Bureau intends no substantive difference between the final rule and the proposal, but has made this change to conform to similar changes in the Bureau's 2013 TILA Mortgage Servicing Final Rule.",

The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 39(a)-6 and is adopting it substantially as proposed, but reorganized under comment 39(a)-1 as a clarification to whether a borrower is \u201cdelinquent\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.39(a).

With respect to the live contact requirement, servicers would be required to establish live contact or make good faith efforts to do so with borrowers to determine whether to inform borrowers of loss mitigation options. Thus, a servicer must establish live contact or make good faith effort to establish live contact, even with borrowers who are regularly delinquent, by the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency.

The Bureau agrees that, in certain situations, such as where the borrower is represented by an attorney, it may be appropriate for servicers to communicate with the borrower's authorized representative, particularly in situations involving delinquency that may result in foreclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 39(a)-4 to explain that &#167; 1024.39 does not prohibit a servicer from satisfying the requirements of &#167; 1024.39 by establishing live contact with, and, if applicable, providing information about loss mitigation to a person authorized by the borrower to communicate with the servicer on the borrower's behalf. The comment provides that a servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf.

By comparison, the requirements applicable to notices of error and information requests under \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 36 include comments 35(a)-1 and 36(a)-1, which explain that notices of error and information requests from a borrower's representative are treated the same way that servicers treat such communications from a borrower though the servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. In situations involving notices of error or information requests, in which a borrower requests through a representative that the servicer take some action that the servicer may not otherwise perform, there is some risk that a servicer might claim it had no obligation to act if the regulation only required actions with respect to the \u201cborrower.\u201d However, \u00a7 1024.39 requires that servicers reach out to borrowers. Thus, the risk that servicers would claim they had no obligation to act with respect to a borrower is not present in this case; to the contrary, the Bureau believes it would mitigate the burden on the servicer to be able to communicate with either the borrower or the borrower's representative."

                                        "After considering comments on the proposal, the Bureau is revising the proposed oral notice requirement into a live contact requirement permits servicers to exercise reasonable discretion in determining whether informing delinquent borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances. The Bureau is also adjusting the timing of the contact requirement from the proposed 30-day timeframe to 36 days.", 
                                        "Under \u00a7 1024.39(a), a servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact with a delinquent borrower not later than the 36th day of the borrower's delinquency and, promptly after establishing live contact, inform such borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options \u201cif appropriate.\u201d The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-3.i to clarify that it is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether informing a borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances. To illustrate, comment 39(a)-3.i provides examples demonstrating when a servicer has made a reasonable determination regarding the appropriateness of providing information about loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.i.A illustrates a scenario in which a servicer provides information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower that notifies a servicer during live contact of a material adverse change in the borrower's financial circumstances that is likely to cause the borrower to experience a long-term delinquency for which loss mitigation options may be available. Comment 39(a)-3.i.B illustrates a scenario in which a servicer does not provide information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower who has missed a January 1 payment and notified the servicer that full late payment will be transmitted to the servicer by February 15.", 
                                        "The Bureau is adopting a modified version of the proposed oral notice in \u00a7 1024.39(a) because the Bureau agrees that a prescriptive requirement to provide an oral notice for all delinquent borrowers, where loss mitigation options were available, within the first 30 days of a delinquency would be overbroad. The Bureau observes that the oral notice as proposed would not have required servicers to offer options in a manner that is inconsistent with investor or guarantor requirements because servicers would only have had to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options, if applicable, \u201cmay\u201d be available; servicers would not have been required to provide information about or offer options that the servicer did not already offer. However, the Bureau recognizes the potential for borrower confusion if servicers are required in every instance to notify borrowers who are experiencing short-term delinquencies of available loss mitigation options if these borrowers ultimately are unlikely to need or be eligible for such options. The Bureau agrees that providing the notice within the first 30 days of a borrower's delinquency may be unwarranted if a borrower would not ultimately qualify based on investor or guarantor requirements or for whom loss mitigation options are unnecessary, such as for borrowers who are experiencing a short-term cash-flow problem. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, borrowers who are 30 days delinquent generally present a lower risk for default, (compared to borrowers with more extended delinquencies), and such borrowers typically resolve their delinquency without the assistance of loss mitigation options.\n            \n          ", 
                                        "Nonetheless, while many borrowers who miss a payment will be able to self-cure within 30 days, some portion of these borrowers are likely to fall further behind on their payments, and the Bureau believes servicers should make efforts to inform such borrowers that help is available. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, evidence suggests that one of the barriers to communication between borrowers and servicers is that borrowers do not know that servicers may be helpful or that they have options to avoid foreclosure, and that as a result of these barriers, borrowers may not know that help is available until too late, when it can be more difficult to cure a delinquency. Although borrowers may receive notice of loss mitigation options through other written notices, such as the written early intervention notice proposed at \u00a7 1024.39(b), borrowers may be reluctant to contact a servicer on their own but would nonetheless benefit from early notification that help is available. By establishing early live contact with borrowers, servicers would be able to begin working with the borrower to develop appropriate relief at the early stages of a delinquency. The Bureau recognizes that, by giving servicers flexibility to determine whether it is appropriate under the circumstances to notify borrowers about loss mitigation options, there is some risk that servicers, despite their reasonable exercise of discretion, may incorrectly determine a borrower is experiencing a short-term delinquency. The Bureau believes that, on balance, the potential that delinquent borrowers may remain uninformed of their options is mitigated by the requirement in \u00a7 1024.39(b)(1), discussed below, to provide a written notice not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency.", 
                                        "Proposed comment 39(a)-1.i would have clarified that the proposed oral notice would have to be made through live contact or good faith efforts to make live contact, such as by telephoning or conducting an in-person meeting with the borrower, but not leaving a recorded message. The final rule adopts proposed comment 39(a)-1.i substantially as proposed, which the Bureau has renumbered as comment 39(a)-2 for organizational purposes. Final comment 39(a)-2 includes guidance appearing in proposed comment 39(a)-1.i about the meaning of live contact, but omits reference to the notice required under 1024.39(a) because, as discussed immediately below, the final rule does not require servicers to inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options under \u00a7 1024.39(a) during live contact. Final comment 39(a)-2 further clarifies that a servicer may, but need not, rely on live contact established at the borrower's initiative to satisfy the live contact requirement in \u00a7 1024.39(a). Final comment 39(a)-2 also explains that live contact provides servicers an opportunity to discuss the circumstances of a borrower's delinquency.", 
                                        "The Bureau has added comment 39(a)-3.ii to clarify that, if appropriate, servicers may inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options orally, in writing, or through electronic communication, but that servicers must provide such information promptly after the servicer establishes live contact. This comment is intended to provide servicers flexibility in notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options at the early stages of delinquency. The Bureau believes establishing initial live contact is important for a servicer to learn about the circumstances for a borrower's delinquency and to determine whether it is appropriate under the circumstances to inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options. The Bureau believes that providing borrowers with initial notice about the availability of loss mitigation options may be accomplished through an oral conversation or information delivered in writing, as long as it is provided promptly after the servicer establishes live contact, if appropriate.", 
                                        "Comment 39(a)-3.ii further explains that a servicer need not notify a borrower about any particular loss mitigation options promptly after the servicer determines that a borrower should be informed of loss mitigation options; a servicer need only inform a borrower generally that loss mitigation options may be available. This comment is substantially similar to proposed comment 39(a)-1.ii. The Bureau is not requiring that servicers to provide detailed information about all loss mitigation options, application deadlines, or foreclosure timelines because not all borrowers may benefit from such a conversation at the time of this contact. Further, the Bureau believes the continuity of contact provisions at \u00a7 1024.40 will serve to provide borrowers with access to personnel who can assist them with loss mitigation options. Comment 39(a)-3.ii also explains that, if appropriate, a servicer may satisfy the requirement in \u00a7 1024.39(a) to inform a borrower about loss mitigation options by providing the written notice required by \u00a7 1024.39(b)(1), but the servicer must provide such notice promptly after the servicer establishes live contact. The Bureau believes that the written notice that must be provided by the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency pursuant to \u00a7 1024.39(a) provides sufficient information about the availability of loss mitigation options."

Proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) also provided that if the servicer attempts to notify the borrower by telephone, good faith efforts would require calling the borrower on at least three separate days in order to reach the borrower. The Bureau explained in the section-by-section analysis of the proposed rule that the \u201cif applicable\u201d qualification in proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) meant that servicers that do not make any loss mitigation options available to borrowers would not be required to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available.",

The comment also would have clarified that a servicer may provide more detailed information that the servicer believes would be helpful. Proposed comment 39(a)-2 clarified that, in order to make a good faith effort by telephone, the servicer must complete the three phone calls attempting to reach the borrower by the end of the 30-day period after the payment due date.", 
                                "The Bureau received significant comment on the proposed oral notice from consumer advocacy groups, trade associations, credit unions, community banks, rural servicers, large banks, non-bank servicers, and individual consumers. Consumer advocacy groups and two residential real estate trade associations were generally supportive of an oral notice requirement. One coalition of consumer advocacy groups explained that a mandatory phone call or visit would alert borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available and give borrowers an opportunity to ask questions and gather accurate information about the borrower's rights and responsibilities. Several consumer advocacy groups and individual consumers supported an oral notice requirement because it would permit borrowers to engage in an interactive conversation with servicers about their rights and responsibilities surrounding loss mitigation. A number of consumer advocacy groups, however, requested that the Bureau require that servicers provide more information about loss mitigation options than the notice set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a). These commenters recommended that servicers notify borrowers of all loss mitigation options that may be available, including application instructions and deadlines, and information about the foreclosure process at the time of the oral notice. Several consumer advocacy groups also recommended that the Bureau delete proposed comment 39(a)-1.ii, which explained that a servicer need not describe specific loss mitigation options during the oral notice and that the servicer need only inform borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available, if applicable.", 
                                "Industry commenters expressed concern about the circumstances under which servicers would be required to notify borrowers about loss mitigation options. These commenters explained that a servicer's offer of loss mitigation depends on not only the stage of a borrower's delinquency but also the nature of the delinquency, as well as other circumstances, pursuant to investor or guarantor guidelines and could be perceived as misleading for borrowers who are ultimately ineligible based on owner or investor requirements. These commenters, including one Federal agency, also expressed concern that informing borrowers of loss mitigation options that are inappropriate for short-term delinquencies could impede the resolution of delinquent loans by discouraging borrowers from resolving a short-term delinquency they could have cured on their own. Industry commenters also asserted that notifying borrowers about loss mitigation options too early would be confusing or perceived as potentially harassing for those borrowers at low risk of default. In addition, several commenters cited concerns that requiring early intervention for low-risk borrowers would detract from helping high-risk borrowers. To address these concerns, they requested that the Bureau clarify the circumstances under which servicers would be required to notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available. In particular, several commenters requested that the Bureau clarify that, before providing the notice regarding loss mitigation options, a servicer may first determine whether a borrower is experiencing a short- or long-term delinquency, and that servicers be permitted to pursue collection efforts in the case of short-term delinquencies.", 
                                "Industry commenters also expressed concern with demonstrating compliance with the oral notice requirement, particularly in light of the possibility of a private right of action under RESPA section 6, which the Bureau relied on as a source of legal authority for proposed \u00a7 1024.39. Rural, community bank, and credit union servicers recommended against an oral notice requirement because such requirements are difficult to track and verify, would require systems reprogramming or upgrades, may be misunderstood by borrowers, and would not guarantee establishing contact with borrowers. One community bank commenter stated that a simple delinquency notice should suffice, without a need to have a live conversation about loss mitigation options. Several rural and credit union servicers indicated that staffing and resource limitations would make it difficult to reach borrowers after normal work hours, when most borrowers are available by phone. One industry commenter recommended that the Bureau mandate in-person outreach in addition to the oral and written notice requirements while another industry commenter asked that the Bureau clarify that this provision does not mandate in-person outreach.", 
                                "Several industry commenters and individual consumers recommended that other forms of contact, such as text messages or email should be permitted, but not required, to satisfy good faith efforts, or that email should be permitted in lieu of live contact. These commenters noted that a more flexible approach, such as permitting written or other forms of electronic contact, would help reach borrowers and address compliance issues because written methods are more easily tracked. Several industry commenters requested that the Bureau permit servicers to engage in any form of contact that is reasonable under the circumstances. One industry commenter suggested that servicers should be permitted to leave a recorded message instead of three phone calls.", 
                                "By contrast, a number of consumer advocacy groups stated that the good faith effort standard as proposed was reasonable, although some recommended that servicers be required to engage in more efforts to contact the borrower, such as by attempting to contact borrowers on every telephone number on record in order to reach the borrower and by requiring that servicers leave a message when servicers have that option. Some consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers be required to leave a message when a borrower's telephone number provided a voicemail option, while an industry commenter indicated there may be privacy concerns with respect to any potential requirement for notices to be provided via text or email."

However, unlike the proposed oral notice that servicers would have been required to provide, or make good faith efforts to provide, not later than 30 days after a payment due date, the Bureau proposed to require that the written notice be provided not later than 40 days after the payment due date. The Bureau had proposed a 40-day deadline to provide borrowers a reasonable opportunity to cure a short-term delinquency while also ensuring that they received information on loss mitigation options at the early stages of a delinquency. The Bureau proposed to permit servicers to provide the written notice at any time during the 40-day period. The Bureau proposed a deadline for the written notice that occurred after the 30-day deadline for the proposed oral notice to provide servicers an opportunity to tailor the written notice and other information to the borrower's individual circumstances following the oral notice. However, servicers would also have had the option of sending the notice at any time after the borrower's missed payment. The Bureau proposed to include guidance at comment 39(b)(1)-2 to clarify that servicers should consider a payment late in the same manner as they would for purposes of calculating when the oral notice must be provided. The Bureau solicited comment on whether the written deadline should be extended to 45 days, 65 days, or longer.",

Most industry commenters recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline for the written notice to sometime between 45 and 70 days after a missed payment. Industry commenters argued that extending the deadline would preserve servicer flexibility in managing delinquencies and reduce the compliance burden in light of existing early intervention practices and requirements. Similar to arguments made about the proposed oral notice, industry commenters and a Federal agency expressed concern that informing a borrower of loss mitigation options that the borrower does not qualify for or that are not available to the borrower could cause borrower confusion and impede the resolution of delinquent loans.", 
                                "Industry commenters and several consumer advocacy groups noted that extending the deadline for the written notice would allow servicers time to distinguish between high- and low-risk borrowers, allowing servicers to focus on high-risk borrowers while avoiding the need to make contact with borrowers who are able to self-cure the occasional late payment or those who are repeatedly delinquent but who eventually make their payments. Several industry commenters recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 60 days to permit servicers additional time to complete an eligibility assessment required under HAMP and the National Mortgage Settlement. One trade association noted that the Bureau's original outline of proposals under consideration included a proposal for servicers to provide borrowers with written information about loss mitigation options within five days after notifying the servicer that they may have trouble making their payments. The commenter requested that this be a requirement in the final rule.", 
                                "In addition, as with the proposed oral notice, industry commenters were concerned that the Bureau's requirements may be duplicative of or not perfectly aligned with existing State and Federal requirements, GSE guidelines, consent orders, and settlement agreements. Many industry commenters noted that a 40-day deadline would be premature and that it would be more efficient, common, and would avoid borrower confusion to send the notice by 45 days after a missed payment, consistent with other notices that servicers send by that time, such as breach letters, a notice under section 106(c)(5) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, regarding the availability of housing counselors (12 U.S.C. 1701x(c)(5)(B)), and a notice under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. 501 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>).\n            One large servicer explained that extending the deadline from 40 to 45 days would still provide borrowers with sufficient notice of loss mitigation options before a servicer begins the foreclosure process. One industry commenter recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to 50 days after the payment due date to better accommodate other loss mitigation-related communications that go out by the 45th day of delinquency. In addition, a variety of servicers and trade associations requested additional flexibility in delivering the content of the written notice, such as by combining the proposed written notice requirement with existing notices.", 
                                "The GSEs, certain large lenders, and trade associations, as well as several consumer advocacy groups, recommended that the Bureau permit servicers to send the written notice by the 60th, 65th or 70th day of a borrower's delinquency. Other industry commenters and a few consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline to sometime between 60 and 70 days after a missed payment. A number of commenters expressed concern that the proposed 40-day notice was not in line with GSE guidelines that permit servicers to send a loss mitigation solicitation package to borrowers identified by the servicer as low default risks by the 65th day of the borrower's delinquency. Other commenters recommended that the Bureau permit an exemption from the 40-day deadline for servicers to comply with a later deadline if the servicer uses behavior modeling to identify chronically late payers that do not appear at risk of serious delinquency and where the notice is unlikely to be helpful, in order to better align with GSE practice.", 
                                "Based on comments received, the Bureau is adopting a 45-day deadline rather than a 40-day deadline in the final rule. First, the Bureau believes that a 45-day deadline strikes an appropriate balance between permitting servicers flexibility in managing delinquencies and providing borrowers information at the early stages of a delinquency. Some borrowers are in the habit of making their mortgage payments after the due date in order to take advantage of the 15-day period generally available to make payment without incurring a late fee. A borrower who has missed a payment entirely may likewise wait until up to the 15th day after the next payment is due (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the 45th day after the initial payment was due) before making a payment. A 45-day deadline would permit borrowers to receive a written notice of loss mitigation options at the early stages of their delinquency while also permitting servicers to distinguish between borrowers who can self-cure out of a 30-day delinquency and those experiencing longer-term problems. The Bureau believes that the fact that a borrower has not satisfied a late payment by the 45th day of a delinquency generally indicates that such borrower is having difficulty making payments and should be informed of the availability of loss mitigation options.", 
                                "The Bureau understands that some servicers may not be able to complete eligibility assessments for borrowers by the 45th day of a delinquency under HAMP (which is set to expire by December 31, 2013).\n            However, the Bureau's rule would not require that servicers make a determination of eligibility of loss mitigation options by this time; they require only that they notify borrowers that loss mitigation options may be available. The Bureau has crafted flexible content standards that would not require servicers to list specific loss mitigation options in the written notice. With respect to the National Mortgage Settlement, the Bureau believes a 45-day standard would be in line with the Settlement terms requiring servicers to commence outreach efforts after the second missed payment.", 
                                "The Bureau understands that GSE servicers have additional flexibility in providing the solicitation package to certain lower-risk borrowers as late as the 65th day of their delinquency.\n            As noted above, several industry commenters and consumer advocacy groups recommended that the Bureau extend the deadline for the written notice to sometime between 60 and 70 days after a missed payment in order to accommodate this GSE practice. However, the Bureau is not adopting an exemption for servicers who use behavior modeling tools to identify lower-risk borrowers for the following reasons. Evidence available to the Bureau indicates that the longer a borrower remains delinquent, the more difficult it can be to avoid foreclosure,\n            particularly as a borrower experiences a delinquency lasting 60 days or longer.\n\n            While waiting to day 65 to see if a delinquent borrower has self-cured may be appropriate for low-risk borrowers, modeling tools to predict future behavior are inherently imprecise and identify a certain number of borrowers who are predicted to self-cure but do not. At this time, the Bureau does not have data with which to validate or evaluate such models. Further, the Bureau is concerned that if these borrowers are not informed of their options until the beginning of the third month of their delinquency, it may be more difficult for them to find a solution than if they were notified sooner.", 
                                "The Bureau appreciates that a 45-day notice requirement might result in notices to borrowers who would self-cure without any notice. On balance, however, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to be potentially overbroad to avoid situations in which borrowers may not receive any information until potentially three months of missed payments. The Bureau has sought to address the compliance burden on GSE servicers who use behavior modeling tools by creating flexible content standards for the written notice. The Bureau has also sought to limit the burden of sending the notice by limiting the number of times a borrower would receive the notice, as discussed in more detail below.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau believes a 45-day deadline would be more consistent with other notices that servicers send by that time than the 40-day deadline as originally proposed. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2), the Bureau has sought to adopt flexible content requirements for the 45-day written notice to accommodate existing early intervention notices. The Bureau agrees that permitting servicers to comply with \u00a7 1024.39(b) by combining other notices that go out at this time would reduce possible confusion among borrowers as well as compliance burden. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the discussion of comment 39(b)(2)-3 below. Servicers of VA loans generally must provide borrowers with a letter if payment has not been received within 30 days after it is due and telephone contact could not be made.\n            HUD generally requires servicers of FHA-insured loans to provide each mortgagor in default HUD's &#8220;Avoiding Foreclosure&#8221; pamphlet, or a form developed by the mortgagee and approved by HUD, not later than the end of the second month of delinquency, although HUD recommends sending the form by the 32nd day of delinquency in order to prevent foreclosures from proceeding where avoidable.\n            \n          ", 
                                "Section 106(c)(5) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, generally requires creditors to provide notice of homeownership counseling to eligible delinquent borrowers not later than 45 days after a borrower misses a payment due date. 12 U.S.C. 1701x(c)(5)(B). In addition, HUD has developed a notice pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, as amended, providing notice of servicemembers' rights that must be provided within 45 days of a missed payment. Servicers of GSE loans are expected to send a written package soliciting delinquent borrowers to apply for loss mitigation options 31 to 35 days after a payment due date, unless the servicer has made contact with the borrower and received a promise to cure the delinquency within 30 days.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau is not adopting a requirement in the final rule for servicers to provide the \u00a7 1024.39(b) written notice based solely on a borrower's indication of difficulty in making payment. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.39(a) and comment 39(a)-3.i, servicers must promptly inform borrowers of the availability of loss mitigation options if appropriate, which servicers may determine based on their exercise of reasonable discretion. If the servicer determines informing a borrower of loss mitigation options is appropriate, they may choose to do so orally or in writing, in accordance with comment 39(a)-3.ii. The Bureau believes a strict 45-day deadline for the written notice required under \u00a7 1024.39(b) is necessary to mitigate the risk that borrowers may not receive notice of the availability of loss mitigation options pursuant \u00a7 1024.39(a): a servicer may not establish live contact with a borrower despite good faith efforts to do, or a servicer may make a reasonable determination that such notice is not appropriate under \u00a7 1024.39(a). In addition, as previously noted, a single deadline would provide servicers with flexibility, within the deadline, to determine the most appropriate time to provide the written notice, <em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> for borrowers who may be able to self-cure. Finally, the Bureau believes that new &#167; 1024.36, which will require servicers to respond to information requests, and new &#167; 1024.38(b)(2)(i), which requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that servicers provide accurate information regarding loss mitigation options available to a borrower, will address situations in which borrowers request information about loss mitigation and foreclosure.", 
                                "In the final rule, the Bureau uses the term \u201cdelinquency\u201d to identify when the 45-day period begins. The Bureau has clarified the meaning of delinquency in commentary in a manner substantially similar to the late payment trigger that was proposed in \u00a7 1024.39(b). Accordingly, in the final rule, \u00a7 1024.39(a) requires a servicer to provide the written notice not later than the 45th day of \u201ca borrower's delinquency.\u201d Comment 39(b)(1)-1 contains a cross-reference to comment 39(a)-1, which generally explains that delinquency begins on the day a payment sufficient to cover, principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow for a given billing cycle is due and unpaid, even if the borrower is afforded a period of time after the due date has passed to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee. The cross-reference also clarifies that a borrower is not delinquent for purposes of \u00a7 1024.39 if the borrower is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option designed to bring the borrower current on a previously missed payment.", 
                                "Comment 39(b)(1)-1 provides an example substantially similar to the example proposed as comment 39(b)(1)-2, in which a borrower misses a January 1 payment that remains due during the 45-day period after January 1, requiring that the servicer provide the written notice by February 15. Comment 39(b)(1)-1 also contains an example similar to the example in proposed comment 39(b)(1)-3, which explained that a servicer is not required to provide the written notice if the borrower makes the payment during the 45 days after the payment due date. The Bureau has also replaced the 40-day period in the comment with a 45-day period to conform to changes adopted in the final rule regarding the timing of the written notice. The Bureau has made this change to clarify that the notice must be provided only if the borrower is delinquent, and must be provided not later than the 45th day of the borrower's delinquency."

The Bureau does not believe that borrowers who consistently carry a short-term delinquency would benefit from receiving the same written notice every month. Because \u00a7 1024.32 requires that the written notice be provided in a form the borrower may keep, borrowers would be able to retain the disclosure for future reference. In addition, a 180-day timeframe is generally consistent with HUD's requirement that, in connection with FHA loans, HUD's \u201cAvoiding Foreclosure\u201d pamphlet must be resent to delinquent borrowers unless the beginning of the new delinquency occurs less than six months after the pamphlet was last mailed.\n            \n          ",

In addition, borrowers who previously worked with servicer personnel assigned under the continuity of contact rule to develop a loss mitigation option would know that they may contact their servicer to discuss loss mitigation options.

Further, as the Bureau noted in its proposal, even if a borrower receives information about the availability of loss mitigation options orally, the Bureau believes a written notice is still necessary if a borrower has not cured by day 45 because borrowers may be unable to adequately assess and recall detailed information provided orally and the written notice would provide more information than what would likely have been provided under \u00a7 1024.39(a).",

In addition, the definition of \u201cLoss mitigation option\u201d is limited to options offered by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that are available through the servicer. Thus, options that are not offered by an owner or assignee and thus not available through the servicer would not be required to be listed.

Finally, the Bureau has retained the \u201cif applicable\u201d qualifier in \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) setting forth requirements to describe loss mitigation options. Thus, if an owner or assignee of a loan offers no loss mitigation options for delinquent borrowers, the servicer would not be required to include statements describing loss mitigation options, but would still be required to send a notice encouraging the borrower to contact the servicer and containing information about housing counselors; the Bureau believes borrowers would benefit from information about how to contact their servicer or housing counselors to ask questions, for example, about how the foreclosure process works."

Thus, the Bureau is adopting generally applicable minimum content requirements that can be tailored to a specific situations, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) below. As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.30(b), the Bureau is granting exemptions from \u00a7 1024.39 for small servicers, servicers with respect to reverse mortgages, and servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that permitting servicers to incorporate relevant portions of the notice required under \u00a7 1024.39(b)(1) into other disclosures that already include some or all of the statements required by \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) would reduce the potential for borrower confusion otherwise resulting from duplicative statements. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 39(b)(2)-3 to clarify that servicers may satisfy the requirement to provide the written notice by grouping other notices that satisfy the content requirements of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) into the same mailing, provided each of the required statements satisfies the clear and conspicuous standard in \u00a7 1024.32(a)(1).", 
                                "To accommodate existing servicer requirements and practices, proposed comment 39(b)(2)-1 explained that a servicer may provide additional information beyond the proposed content requirements that the servicer determines would be beneficial to the borrower. This would include any additional disclosures that servicers believe would be helpful, such as directing borrowers to Web sites. In addition, proposed comment 39(b)(2)-2 explained that any color, number of pages, size and quality of paper, type of print, and method of reproduction may be used so long as the disclosure is clearly legible. The Bureau is adopting comments 39(b)(2)-1 and 39(b)(2)-2 substantially as proposed. The Bureau has further amended proposed comment 39(b)(2)-1 to provide that servicers may provide additional information that the servicer determines would be helpful \u201cor which may be required by applicable law or the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan.\u201d The Bureau has added this language to clarify that servicers may provide additional content that may be required by, for example, State law. The Bureau has revised guidance in proposed comment 39(b)(2)-2 that had clarified that the statements required by \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) must be \u201cclearly legible.\u201d Instead, comment 39(b)(2)-2 explains that the statements required by \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) must satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard in \u00a7 1024.32(a)(1). The Bureau has made this revision in order to clarify that the \u00a7 1024.39(b) written notice is subject to the same legibility standard applicable to other notices, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.32(a)(1).", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau notes that comment MS-2, which provides commentary that is generally applicable to the model forms and clauses in appendix MS, clarifies that, except as otherwise specifically required, servicers may add graphics or icons, such as the servicer's corporate logo, to the model forms and clauses. Thus, it is unnecessary to include a comment to \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) to clarify that servicers may include corporate logos. The Bureau has addressed consumer group comments regarding additional content for the written notice below."

By contrast, several industry commenters recommended that the description of loss mitigation options should be minimal, asserting that lengthy explanations could confuse, overwhelm, and discourage borrowers from reaching out to their servicer. One large servicer indicated that, in its experience, providing borrowers with more generic information about loss mitigation options resulted in better contact rates and pull through to complete loan modifications. One industry commenter recommended that any communication regarding loss mitigation options should explicitly state that all loss mitigation options have qualification requirements and that not all options are available to all consumers to address the risk that listing options that are not available to certain borrowers could be perceived as deceptive.",

The Bureau understands that, pursuant to investor or guarantor requirements, eligibility criteria for certain loss mitigation options are complex and may depend on circumstances that may arise over the course of a borrower's delinquency. In addition, the Bureau understands that loss mitigation options may comprise several programs; servicers may have, for example several different types of loan modification options. The Bureau understands that there may be operational difficulties associated with explaining subtle differences among these programs in a written notice. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that a lengthy written notice may undermine the intended effect of encouraging borrowers to contact their servicers to discuss their options. The Bureau is not requiring servicers to provide each borrower with an individually tailored written notice about that borrower's options because the Bureau does not believe it would be practicable for servicers to provide such a notice at this stage of a borrower's delinquency or without additional information about a borrower's particular circumstances. Instead, the Bureau believes borrowers would be better served by servicer continuity of contact personnel explaining, in accordance with policies and procedures required under \u00a7 1024.40(b), the various loss mitigation options for which borrowers may be eligible.",

The comment further explains that a servicer may include a generic list of loss mitigation options that it offers to borrowers, and that it may include a statement that not all borrowers will qualify for all of the listed options, because different loss mitigation options may be available to borrowers depending on the borrower's qualifications or other factors. The Bureau proposed this comment to avoid borrower confusion regarding their eligibility for loss mitigation options listed in the materials. The Bureau agrees that servicers should be able to clarify that not all of the enumerated loss mitigation options will necessarily be available.

In addition to application deadlines, many consumer advocacy groups recommended that servicers be required to provide borrowers with eligibility requirements, an application form and application instructions, along with a clear list of required documentation necessary to be considered a complete application, consistent with GSE practice. By contrast, an industry commenter indicated that communications about loss mitigation options should be more general in nature rather than provide too much detail that might overwhelm borrowers. An individual consumer indicated that the most important element of the notice was to inform borrowers who they could contact to discuss their options.", 
                                "While the Bureau appreciates that borrowers may benefit from knowing about the applicability of deadlines, the Bureau is concerned that there may be operational difficulties with a requirement to disclose application deadlines in the written notice at \u00a7 1024.39(b). Because the Bureau is not requiring servicers to disclose in the written notice all loss mitigation options available from the servicer, the Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to require servicers to disclose all loss mitigation application deadlines that may apply; otherwise, such information could be confusing to borrowers. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that there may be comprehension difficulties associated with an explanation in the \u00a7 1024.39(b) written notice of the interaction between application deadlines and deadlines in the Bureau's loss mitigation procedures at \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau believes that a requirement to specifically identify application deadlines in the early intervention notice requires further analysis by the Bureau to address the concern that disclosure of deadlines occurring far in the future might discourage borrowers from acting quickly to resolve a delinquency. See the discussion below under the heading \u201cForeclosure Statement\u201d for more discussion of the Bureau's concerns about borrower perception of deadlines in the early intervention notice. Further, the Bureau notes that servicers must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicer personnel assigned to a borrower pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(a) provide borrowers accurate information about actions that the borrower must take to be evaluated for loss mitigation options and applicable loss mitigation deadlines established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or \u00a7 1024.41. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1024.40(b)(1)(ii) and (v); &#167; 1024.41 (setting forth various procedural requirements and timeframes governing a servicer's consideration of a borrower's loss mitigation application). Finally, because the Bureau is adopting &#167; 1024.41(f)(1) to prohibit servicers from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law unless a borrower's mortgage loan is more than 120 days delinquent, borrowers will have more time to submit loss mitigation applications before a servicer initiates the foreclosure process.", 
                                "The Bureau is not adopting a rule to require servicers to identify application materials in the written notice. At the time the Bureau proposed its early intervention requirements for the Small Business Review Panel, the Bureau considered requiring servicers to provide a brief outline of the requirements for qualifying for any available loss mitigation programs, including documents and other information the borrower must provide, and any timelines that apply.\n            The Bureau did not propose requiring servicers to provide this level of detail because each loss mitigation option may have its own specific documentation requirements and servicers may be unable to provide comprehensive application instructions generally applicable to all options. Additionally, because the Bureau had proposed that servicers provide only examples of loss mitigation options in the written notice, the proposal noted that detailed instructions for only the listed options may not be useful for all borrowers. The Bureau believes setting consistent and streamlined requirements best achieves the central purpose of the early intervention notice, which is to inform borrowers that help is available and to encourage them to contact their servicer. In addition, the Bureau understands that not all loss mitigation options are necessarily appropriate for every borrower. The Bureau is concerned that a requirement to provide application materials for all options listed in the notice might be overwhelming for borrowers at this stage in the process. Servicers might have multiple loss mitigation options and each may have its own documentation requirements. A requirement to prospectively disclose all documentation requirements for all listed options could prove voluminous. Additionally, a borrower's eligibility for options depends on the borrower's circumstances as well as the stage of delinquency, and the Bureau believes servicers or housing counselors are best suited to advising borrowers about their options during a live conversation.",

These requirements are designed to ensure servicers have servicer personnel dedicated to guiding such borrowers through the loss mitigation application process. Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(a), servicers must maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the objective of making available to a delinquent borrower telephone access to servicer personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries and, as applicable, assist the borrower with loss mitigation options to borrowers by the time the servicer provides the borrower with the \u00a7 1024.39(b) written notice but in any event no than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency. Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1), the Bureau has set forth objectives that servicer policies and procedures for continuity of contact personnel must be reasonably designed to achieve. These objectives include providing accurate information about loss mitigation options available to a borrower from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan; actions the borrower must take to be evaluated for such options, including actions the borrower must take to submit a complete loss mitigation application, as defined in \u00a7 1024.31, and, if applicable, actions the borrower must take to appeal the servicer's determination to deny the borrower's loss mitigation application for any trial or permanent loan modification program offered by the servicer; the status of any loss mitigation application that the borrower has submitted to the servicer; the circumstances under which the servicer may make a referral to foreclosure; and applicable loss mitigation deadlines established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or \u00a7 1024.41.

Accordingly, the Bureau proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iv)-1 to explain that, to expedite the borrower's timely application for any loss mitigation options, servicers may wish to provide more detailed instructions on how a borrower could apply, such as by listing representative documents the borrower should make available to the servicer, such as tax filings or income statements, and by providing estimates for when the servicer expects to make a decision on a loss mitigation option. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(iv)-1 also provided that servicers may supplement the written notice with a loss mitigation application form.

The Bureau proposed to clarify through comment 39(b)(2)(v)-1 that the servicer may explain that the foreclosure process may vary depending on the circumstances, such as the location of the borrower's property that secures the loan, whether the borrower is covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and the requirements of the owner or assignee of the borrower's loan. The Bureau also proposed to clarify through comment 39(b)(2)(v)-2 that the servicer may qualify its estimates with a statement that different timelines may vary depending on the circumstances, such as those listed in comment 39(b)(2)(v)-1. Proposed comment 39(b)(2)(v)-2 also explained that the servicer may provide its estimate as a range of days.", 
                                "Consumer advocacy groups and industry commenters were generally divided over whether servicers should be required to provide information about foreclosure in the written notice, although one industry trade group supported such a requirement. Several industry commenters supported the Bureau's proposal to provide an estimated range of dates for when foreclosure may occur, citing the need to be flexible in light of unforeseen circumstances and the variety of timelines in which a foreclosure could proceed in light of the nature of the property. However, other industry commenters were concerned that including any range may be too inaccurate to provide meaningful guidance to borrowers because of the variety of factors that could influence a foreclosure referral. One large servicer explained that servicers do not typically review accounts for or pursue foreclosure until much later in a borrower's delinquency and that including information about foreclosure could be construed as a threat to take action that is not likely to happen until much later. Another industry commenter and a trade group expressed concern that requiring prospective disclosure of possible foreclosure timelines could lead to litigation if the information turned out to be inaccurate. By contrast, some consumer advocacy groups recommended that the notices should include a narrower foreclosure timeline. Some consumer advocacy groups also believed it was appropriate to make servicers accountable to their estimates, such as by prohibiting servicers from initiating foreclosure earlier than the timeline in the notice.", 
                                "Industry commenters and consumer advocacy groups were also divided over whether the estimated foreclosure timeline would undermine the purpose of the early intervention notice. Several industry commenters expressed concern that a foreclosure timeline estimate could confuse borrowers into believing that the referral date is the last day for loss mitigation options whereas help may be available even after the foreclosure referral date. One of these commenters recommended that the Bureau add qualifying language to address concerns that a foreclosure timeline estimate could mislead borrowers into believing they had more time to take action to avoid foreclosure.", 
                                "Consumer advocacy groups, on the other hand, believed that a more detailed notice about the foreclosure process could serve an educational function. One consumer advocacy group recommended provision of detailed, State-specific foreclosure timelines tailored to the borrower's residence. One coalition of consumer advocacy groups recommended that the foreclosure statement should provide more explanation of the steps occurring in the foreclosure process, such as a description of court procedures and a sheriff's sale that occur in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions; this group explained that borrowers are often confused about how foreclosure referrals are related to the actual sale of their home. This group of advocates also explained that information when foreclosure will start and end is also important in non-judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, where the foreclosure process can occur quickly and with fewer opportunities for borrowers to object. In addition, this group of advocates recommended that the Bureau should specify a minimum period of time between a missed payment and the date on which foreclosure may begin.", 
                                "The Bureau notes at the outset that because the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1) to delay foreclosure referrals until 120 days after a missed payment, there is less risk of borrower confusion about when foreclosure may begin. Section 1024.41(f)(1) is discussed in more detail below in the applicable section-by-section analysis. Nonetheless, while a single foreclosure deadline would minimize compliance issues around potentially inaccurate estimates, the Bureau is concerned that requiring foreclosure information in the written early intervention notice may cause borrower confusion and may possibly discourage borrowers from seeking early assistance. In addition, an explanation that a servicer will not initiate foreclosure until the 120th day of delinquency may suggest to some borrowers that they cannot submit a loss mitigation application after the initiation of foreclosure, which may not necessarily be the case. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1024.41(g).\n            \n          ", 
                                "During consumer testing of the model clauses, participants had a mixed reaction to the foreclosure statement, which included an estimated timeline for when foreclosure may begin. The statement tested a timeline that explained foreclosure could occur 90-150 days after a missed payment. All participants understood before reading the statement that foreclosure was a process through which their lender could take their home if they did not make their mortgage payments.", 
                                "With respect to the estimated timeline for when foreclosure may begin, some thought that the estimated timeline meant nothing would happen before that date, despite the fact that the clause stated that the process \u201cmay begin earlier or later.\u201d While some participants appeared to be motivated to act quickly because of the foreclosure statement, others commented that the estimated timeline implied that it was less important to act immediately because there would be a period of time during which they would be safe from foreclosure. One participant felt strongly that if it were true that the foreclosure process could start in less than 90 days, then the reference to the 90 to 150 day time period should be removed from the clause because it was misleading.", 
                                "The Bureau is not finalizing the proposed requirement that servicers notify borrowers about foreclosure in the written notice. While the Bureau agrees that the early intervention written notice could serve an educational function with regard to the foreclosure process, the Bureau believes a requirement to notify borrowers about the foreclosure process in the written early intervention notice requires further evaluation by the Bureau because of the risk that such a disclosure could be perceived as confusing or negatively by borrowers, and may discourage some borrowers from reaching out to their servicer promptly. As the Bureau noted in its proposal, during the Small Business Review Panel outreach, some small servicer representatives explained that information about foreclosure is typically not provided until after loss mitigation options have been explored;\n            and during consumer testing, several participants indicated that the tone of the foreclosure statement seemed at odds with the tone of the rest of the clauses encouraging borrowers to resolve their delinquency as soon as possible. Further, the Bureau is concerned that, given the variation in State foreclosure processes, a prescriptive requirement to explain foreclosure may either result in explanations that are too generic to be useful or too complex to be easily understood. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Bureau is removing the proposed requirement that servicers provide information about the foreclosure process in the written early intervention notice.", 
                                "Although the Bureau is not finalizing the requirement for servicers to provide a statement describing foreclosure in the written notice, the Bureau agrees that some borrowers would benefit from receiving information about foreclosure at the time of receiving information about loss mitigation options. Such information could help some borrowers understand their choices they face at the early stages of delinquency. The Bureau believes the requirements to include contact information for housing counselors and servicer personnel assigned under \u00a7 1024.40(a) will help address potential information shortcomings of the written notice. Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(iv), servicers must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that servicer continuity of contact personnel provide accurate information about the circumstances under which borrowers may be referred to foreclosure. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(iv) or model clause MS-4(D), which contained language illustrating the foreclosure statement."

The Bureau solicited comment on whether the written early intervention notice should include a generic list to access counselors or counseling organizations, as proposed here, or a list of specific counselors or counseling organizations, as was proposed in the 2012 HOEPA Proposal.\n            \n          ",

Industry commenters expressed support for the proposed requirement to provide generic contact information for borrowers to access a list of counselors. One industry commenter was concerned that requiring servicers to provide a list of counselors would require frequent updating by servicers to ensure the accuracy of the notice. In addition, the commenter was concerned that providing a list of counselors could be construed as the servicer advocating for a particular counselor. One housing counseling organization and an industry commenter explained that some States already require that servicers provide a list of nonprofit housing counseling agencies at the time of sending a written foreclosure notice. The housing counseling organization recommended that the final rule require servicers to provide a list of HUD-approved nonprofit counseling agencies in the written notice, while the industry commenter was concerned about complying with overlapping requirements.",

One participant indicated that this contact information would be useful to help verify that information provided by the lender was accurate and followed legal guidelines.",

Section 1024.39(b)(2)(v) requires servicers to include in the written notice the Web site to access either the Bureau list or the HUD list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations, and the HUD toll-free telephone number to access homeownership counselors or counseling organizations.\n            The Bureau is modifying the proposed requirement, which would have required servicers to list either the HUD telephone number or a Bureau telephone number. In the final rule, the Bureau is requiring servicers to list the HUD telephone number but not a Bureau telephone number because the Bureau believes the HUD telephone number that currently exists provides adequate access to approved counseling resources.", 
                                "As noted in its proposal, the Bureau believes that delinquent borrowers would benefit from knowing how to access housing counselors because some borrowers may be more comfortable discussing their options with a third-party.\n            In addition, a housing counselor could provide a borrower with additional information about loss mitigation options that a servicer may not have listed on the written notice. The Bureau also believes the contact information to access the HUD or Bureau list would provide borrowers with access to qualified counselors or counseling organizations that could counsel borrowers about potential foreclosure rescue scams. While the Bureau agrees that borrowers may benefit from a list of specific counseling organizations or counselors, the Bureau also believes that there is value in keeping the content requirements in the written notice flexible to ensure the notice is able to accommodate existing requirements, such as State laws, that may overlap with the Bureau's requirements. The Bureau believes that providing borrowers with the Web site address for either the Bureau or HUD list of homeownership counseling agencies and programs would streamline the disclosure and present clear and concise information for borrowers.",

In its proposal, the Bureau sought comment on the costs and benefits of the provision of information about housing counselors and State housing finance authorities to delinquent borrowers in the proposed written notice. The Bureau also sought comment on the potential effect of the Bureau's proposal on access to homeownership counseling generally by borrowers, and the effect of increased borrower demand for counseling on existing counseling resources, including demand on State housing finance authorities.", 
                                "A State housing finance agency, an association of State housing finance agencies, and a large servicer recommended that the Bureau remove housing finance authority contact information from the written notice, citing resource limitations of State housing finance authorities. The large servicer expressed concern that borrowers would blame their servicer for directing them to State housing finance agencies that proved unable to provide assistance, or that such an experience would discourage borrowers from seeking other assistance. Two industry commenters also recommended that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to provide State housing finance authority contact information, citing the tracking burden associated with this requirement. One commenter explained that a phone number to access housing counselors (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> through a HUD or Bureau phone number or Web site) would provide borrowers with sufficient access to assistance. As an alternative, the industry commenter suggested that the Bureau host this information or that the Bureau simply include language that there may be State-sponsored programs in the borrower's State that could be helpful. Another servicer recommended that the written notice simply reference that assistance may be available through the State Housing Finance Authority and provide a telephone number that borrowers could call to learn more about them.", 
                                "In the final rule, the Bureau is omitting the proposed requirement to disclose State housing finance authority contact information in the written notice because the Bureau shares the concern of the State housing finance authorities that directing borrowers to specific State agencies may overwhelm their limited resources. The Bureau also understands that not all State housing finance authorities offer counseling services, which may cause confusion among delinquent borrowers directed to such entities. In addition, the Bureau believes providing contact information for housing counselors or counseling organizations through access to a HUD or Bureau Web site or telephone number will ensure borrowers have access to assistance. Accordingly, the Bureau is amending proposed paragraph (b)(2)(vi) to contain no subparagraphs and is renumbering it as paragraph (b)(2)(v) in light of the deletion of the proposed foreclosure statement. In addition, the Bureau is deleting the portion of model clause MS-4(E) containing language about State housing finance authorities."

The Bureau has added this provision to clarify that the Bureau does not intend for its early intervention requirements to require servicers to take any action that may be prohibited under State law, such as a statutory foreclosure regime that may prohibit certain types of contact with borrowers that may be required under \u00a7 1024.39. The Bureau has also added this provision to clarify that servicers are not required to make contact with borrowers in a manner that may be prohibited by Federal laws, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provisions.

Comment 39(c)-1 provides that \u00a7 1024.39 does not require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case; and that, to the extent permitted by such law or court order, servicers may adapt the requirements of \u00a7 1024.39 in any manner that would permit them to notify borrowers of loss mitigation options.

Specifically, the Bureau believes that \u00a7 1024.40 is necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose under section 1021(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive, and the objective under section 1021(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act of ensuring that markets for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. The Bureau additionally relies on its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which authorizes the Bureau to prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances."

                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Background.</em> As discussed above, this final rule addresses servicers' obligation to provide delinquent borrowers with access to servicer personnel to respond to inquiries, and as applicable, assist them with foreclosure avoidance options. Widespread reports of communication breakdowns between servicers and delinquent borrowers who present a heightened risk for default have revealed that one of the most significant impediments to the success of foreclosure mitigation programs is the inadequate manner by which servicer personnel at major servicers have provided assistance to these borrowers. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the problem was systemic. For example, Federal regulatory agencies reviewing mortgage servicing practices have found that &#8220;a majority of the [servicers examined] had inadequate staffing levels or had recently added staff with limited servicing experience.&#8221;\n            The Bureau proposed &#167; 1024.40 to establish requirements to ensure that there would be a baseline level of standards that would address the issue.", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) would have provided that a servicer must assign personnel to respond to borrower inquiries and as applicable, assist a borrower with loss mitigation options no later than five days after a servicer has provided such borrower with the oral notice that would have been required by proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a). For a transferee servicer, proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) would have required such servicer to make the assignment within a reasonable time after the mortgage servicing right to a borrower's mortgage loan has been transferred to such servicer if the borrower's previous servicer had assigned personnel to such borrower as would have been required by proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) before the mortgage servicing right was transferred and the assignment had not ended when the servicing right was transferred. Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2) would have required a servicer to make access to assigned personnel available via telephone and would have set forth related requirements on what a servicer must do if a borrower contacts the servicer and does not receive a live response from the assigned personnel. Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b) would have required a servicer to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the servicer personnel the servicer assigns to a borrower pursuant to proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a) perform certain enumerated functions. Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) would have set forth requirements with respect to how long the assigned personnel must be assigned and available to a borrower.", 
                        "Although many servicers failed to adequately assist delinquent borrowers, the Bureau recognized that some servicers provide a high level of customer service to their borrowers both to ensure loan performance (because either they or one of their affiliates owned the loan) and maintain strong customer relationships (because they rely on providing borrowers with other products and services and thus have a strong interest in preserving their reputation and relationships with their customers). The Bureau believed that to the extent that a servicer's existing practices with respect to providing assistance to delinquent borrowers have been successful at helping borrowers avoid foreclosure, it was important that these practices be permitted to continue to exist within the framework of proposed \u00a7 1024.40. The Bureau sought to clarify the Bureau's intent by explaining in proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i that the continuity of contact provisions allowed a servicer to exercise discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented.", 
                        "The Bureau received general comments about whether it was appropriate for the Bureau to regulate the manner by which servicer personnel at servicers provide assistance to delinquent borrowers. With one exception, consumer groups expressed support for proposed \u00a7 1024.40. One consumer group that identified itself as primarily serving Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander communities expressed concern that proposed \u00a7 1024.40 only appeared to address the initial assignment of servicer staff to assist delinquent borrowers. The commenter also urged the Bureau to mirror the more prescriptive approach of the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights.", 
                        "A number of consumer groups suggested that the Bureau add an additional requirement to require servicers to establish electronic loan portals to facilitate the exchange of documents related to a borrower's loan modification application. Consumer groups asserted that servicers' insistence that borrowers have not submitted requested documents remains a barrier to loan modification success and that the National Mortgage Settlement already requires the five largest servicers to develop online portals linked to a servicer's primary servicing system where borrowers can check the status of their first-lien loan modifications, at no cost to them.", 
                        "Industry commenters generally expressed agreement with the principle that servicers must have adequate staffing levels to meet the needs of delinquent borrowers and commended the Bureau for recognizing the importance of permitting successful servicing practices with respect to how servicers provide assistance to delinquent borrowers to continue to exist. But smaller servicers and rural creditors subject to Farm Credit Administration rules generally requested exemptions from the continuity of contact requirements.", 
                        "Smaller servicers predicted that the continuity of contact requirements will bring about a significant increase in borrower communication, which they will have to respond by significantly increasing the size of their staff and making substantial changes to their servicing platforms. Smaller servicers asserted that these adjustments will increase their compliance costs and result in the reduction in the high quality of customer service they already provide to their customers. Rural lenders subject to Farm Credit Administration rules asserted that they should be exempted from the Bureau's continuity of contact requirements because they are already required to follow a highly prescriptive set of regulations when working with borrowers with distressed loans issued by the Farm Credit Administration. They expressed concern about potentially having to comply with inconsistent regulations and borrower confusion.", 
                        "A national trade association representing the reverse mortgage industry sought a general exemption for reverse mortgages, asserting that continuity of contact requirements would be duplicative of existing HUD regulations that require servicers of home equity conversion mortgages (HECM) to assign specific employees to assist HECM borrowers and provide the information to HECM borrowers on an annual basis and whenever the assigned employees change.", 
                        "Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to make changes to \u00a7 1024.40 where they contend the proposal is inconsistent with the National Mortgage Settlement because of the cost of potentially being required to comply with different standards. One non-bank servicer requested that the Bureau specify that compliance with \u00a7 1024.40 would provide a safe harbor from compliance with similar applicable law, including State law, the National Mortgage Settlement, HAMP guidelines, and investor requirements. Another non-bank servicer asserted that several of the functions the Bureau proposed to require continuity of contact personnel to perform under \u00a7 1024.40 would require servicers under some States' law to make available licensed loan originators to assist borrowers and that the Bureau should preempt such laws because servicers may not have an adequate number of licensed staff.", 
                        "One bank servicer and one non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau could reduce any potential compliance burden with \u00a7 1024.40 if the Bureau limited a servicer's duty to comply with \u00a7 1024.40 to borrowers who are responsive to servicers' attempts to engage them in foreclosure avoidance options and who have not vacated their principal residences. One non-bank servicer urged the Bureau create an exemption from compliance with continuity of contact requirements with respect to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy.", 
                        "In light of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau has made a number of changes to \u00a7 1024.40. The Bureau has concluded that the best way to ensure that existing, successful servicing practices with respect to assisting delinquent borrowers be able to continue to exist would be to adopt proposed \u00a7 1024.40 as a requirement for servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieved specified objectives, and leave it to each servicers to implement its own policies and procedures calculated to achieve the desired results. Given the flexibility provided by \u00a7 1024.40 as finalized, the Bureau does not discern a need to provide servicers with express safe harbors or preemptions or a need to make \u00a7 1024.40 align exactly with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement.", 
                        "The Bureau also declines to adopt the electronic portal requirement a number of consumers have urged the Bureau to impose on servicers. The Bureau agrees that servicers should, consistent with the purposes of RESPA, facilitate the exchange of documents related to a borrower's loan modification application and is adopting requirements in the final rule that would support this objective. For example, \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(iii) requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of providing prompt access to all documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation option to servicer personnel assigned to assist the borrower as described in \u00a7 1024.40. The Bureau believes that to fulfill this requirement, servicers must have policies and procedures for the use of reasonable means to track and maintain borrower-submitted loss mitigation documents. However, imposing on servicers a specific obligation to establish electronic portals would supplant other reasonable means to track and maintain borrower-submitted loss mitigation documents. As noted above, the Bureau expects to further consider the benefits of electronic portals, as well as requirements regarding electronic communication with servicers more broadly.", 
                        "Further, for reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.30, the Bureau has decided that requirements set forth in the Bureau's discretionary rulemakings are generally not appropriate to impose on small servicers (servicers that servicers 5,000 mortgage loans or less and only servicers mortgage loans that either they or their affiliates own or originated), housing finance agencies, servicers with respect to any mortgage loan for which the servicer is a qualified lender as that term is defined in 12 CFR 617.7000, and servicers of reverse mortgage transactions.", 
                        "In addition, for reasons set forth above, the Bureau has limited the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 through 41 to mortgage loans that are secured by a borrower's principal residence. But the Bureau declines to further limit the scope of \u00a7 1024.40 to \u201cresponsive borrowers\u201d or to exclude borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. As discussed above, the purpose of the early intervention, continuity of contact, and loss mitigation procedure requirements is to ensure that a borrower who resides in a property as a principal residence have the protection of clear standards of review for loss mitigation options so that the borrower can be considered for an option that will assist the borrower in retaining the property and the owner or assignee in mitigating losses. The Bureau believes limiting the applicability of \u00a7 1024.40 to \u201cresponsive\u201d borrowers introduces a notable degree of subjectivity that conflicts with this purpose. The Bureau additionally declines to create an exemption with respect to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy because the exemption would be too broad. A borrower could have filed for bankruptcy but still be eligible for loss mitigation assistance."

                                "For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 1024.40 as a requirement that servicers maintain a set of policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve specified objectives. Accordingly, the Bureau is withdrawing \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) and (2) because they are proposed as specific requirements. But, the objectives the Bureau is adopting in \u00a7 1024.40(a) largely draw from the specific requirements concerning assignment of personnel in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a), unless otherwise noted below. As adopted, \u00a7 1024.40(a) requires a servicer to maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the following objectives: (1) Assign personnel to a delinquent borrower by the time a servicer provides such borrower with the written notice required in \u00a7 1024.39(b), but in any event, not later than the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency; (2) make available to such borrower, via telephone, the assigned personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries and, as applicable, assist the borrower with available loss mitigation options until the borrower has made two consecutive mortgage payments in accordance with the terms of a permanent loss mitigation agreement without incurring a late charge; and (3) ensure that the servicer can provide a live response to a delinquent borrower who contacts the assigned personnel but does not immediately receive a live response.", 
                                "After carefully considering industry commenters' concern that tying the assignment of contact personnel to the oral notification requirement in proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a) might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance, the Bureau has decided to delay the timing of the assignment of contact personnel to the 45th day of a borrower's delinquency, unless the servicer provides the written notice required by \u00a7 1024.39(b) beforehand. The Bureau believes that this change adequately addresses the concern of industry commenters that the proposal might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance. To the extent a servicer becomes obligated to assign contact personnel to a borrower before such borrower becomes 45-days delinquent, it would be because the servicer has determined that such borrower should be informed of the availability of loss mitigation options before day 45.", 
                                "The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to make assignment and availability of contact personnel contingent on a borrower making a request for loss mitigation assistance. The Bureau believes that servicers have more information about the qualifications for various loss mitigation options than borrowers, and accordingly, the Bureau believes it is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA to require servicers to engage a borrower in communication that would facilitate reviewing a borrower for foreclosure avoidance options. The Bureau also disagrees that servicers would be unduly burdened by a continuity of contact provision that does not exactly align with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement. The Bureau observes that the National Mortgage Settlement requires a servicer to identify the contact personnel to a borrower after a borrower has requested assistance. The Bureau is not requiring that a servicer provide borrowers with identifying information about the contact personnel, just that contact personnel be available to borrowers to whom a servicer has provided loss mitigation information to answer borrower inquiries and assist borrowers with loss mitigation options, as applicable. The Bureau believes the Bureau's requirement is less burdensome than the terms and conditions of the National Mortgage Settlement.", 
                                "The Bureau has made changes to proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 in response to general concerns expressed by several industry commenters about communicating with persons other than a borrower with respect to error resolution, information requests, and during the loss mitigation process. Industry commenters asserted that it would be costly to servicers to verify whether such persons are in fact authorized to act on a borrower's behalf. They also expressed concern regarding potential liability for inadvertent release of confidential information and violation of applicable privacy laws.", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledges that requiring servicers to provide continuity of contact personnel to borrowers' agents is more costly than limiting the requirement to borrowers. The Bureau believes, however, that borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in making their mortgage payments or in dealing with their servicer may turn, for example, to a housing counselor or other knowledgeable persons to assist them in addressing such issues. The Bureau believes that it is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA to permit such agents to communicate with the servicer on a borrower's behalf.", 
                                "Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 is adopted as comment 40(a)-1 to clarify that a servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person who claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf and that such reasonable policies and procedures may require that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. The Bureau believes that this clarification adequately balances the duty of servicers to communicate with third parties authorized by delinquent borrowers to act on their behalf in pursuing alternatives to foreclosure and the compliance cost and potential liability asserted by industry commenters and described above. Further, the Bureau notes that this comment is similar to commentary appearing in \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35, 36, and 39.", 
                                "In adopting \u00a7 1024.40(a), the Bureau has added to comment 40(a)-1 clarification of what the term \u201cdelinquent borrower\u201d means for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(a). Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes it would be better to state clearly in \u00a7 1024.40(a) that the continuity of contact requirements in \u00a7 1024.40 only apply to delinquent borrower rather than setting forth a separate section in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) to the same effect. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) and is instead moving the substance of proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c), which the Bureau has modified for reasons set forth below, into commentary as part of comment 40(a)-1 to explain the term \u201cdelinquent borrower.\u201d", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i as comment 40(a)-2. Two GSEs and a credit union commenter asked the Bureau to move the clarification in proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i that a servicer may assign a team of persons to assist a borrower as required by proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) from commentary to rule text. The Bureau declines because the proposed clarification is an example of how a servicer may exercise discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate that the clarification remains in the commentary.", 
                                "As adopted, comment 40(a)-2 additionally provides that a servicer may assign single-purpose or multi-purpose personnel. Single-purpose personnel are personnel whose primary responsibility is to respond to a delinquent borrower who meets the assignment criteria described in \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1). Multi-purpose personnel can be personnel that do not have a primary responsibility at all, or personnel for whom responding to a borrower who meet the assignment criteria set forth in \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) is not the personnel's primary responsibility. The Bureau added this clarification to address comments by industry commenters expressing concern that some servicers do not have the capacity to dedicate staff members to assisting borrowers with loss mitigation options to the exclusion of other responsibilities. Comment 40(a)-2 further explains that when a borrower who meets the assignment criteria of \u00a7 1024.40(a) has filed for bankruptcy, a servicer may assign personnel with specialized knowledge in bankruptcy law to assist such borrowers in response to questions raised by industry commenters about whether the Bureau's continuity of contact requirement would allow servicers to reassign a borrower who has filed for bankruptcy to personnel with specialized knowledge and training in bankruptcy law. Because the Bureau is adopting this clarification in comment 40(a)-2, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-4, which, as explained above, was proposed to clarify the relationship between proposed \u00a7 1024.40 and bankruptcy law to address situations in which servicers transfer the borrower's file to a separate unit of personnel (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> personnel who are not part of the servicer's loss mitigation unit), or to outside bankruptcy counsel to comply with bankruptcy law). The Bureau is also not adopting proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.ii because the final rule no longer ties the assignment of contact personnel to a servicer's provision of the oral notice that would have been required pursuant to proposed &#167; 1024.39(a).", 
                                "As discussed above, proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) would have required a transferee servicer to assign contact personnel to a borrower if the borrower had been assigned personnel by the transferor servicer, and the assignment had not ended at the time of the borrower's mortgage loan had been transferred. The Bureau became concerned that transferee servicers may try to evade compliance with the obligation to provide continuity of contact by asserting that this obligation is contingent upon whether the borrower has been assigned contact personnel by the transferor servicer. The Bureau believes that preventing a servicer's evasion of its continuity of contact obligation is necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA. The Bureau believes that finalized \u00a7 1024.40(a) makes it clear that a servicer's obligation to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to assign contact personnel to certain delinquent borrowers is not contingent upon whether the borrower was assigned such personnel by the borrower's previous servicer."

Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) further provided that if a borrower has been assigned personnel as required by \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) and the assignment has not ended when servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan has transferred to a transferee servicer, subject to \u00a7 1024.40(c)(1) through (4), the transferee servicer must assign personnel to respond to the borrower's inquiries, and as applicable, assist the borrower with loss mitigation options, within a reasonable time of the transfer of servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan. In support of the continuity of contact requirements with respect to the transfer of a borrower's mortgage loan, the Bureau reasoned that the transfer of a borrower's mortgage loan from one servicer to another should not negatively impact the borrower's pursuit of loss mitigation options.", 
                        "Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 would have explained that for purposes of responding to borrower inquiries and assisting the borrower with loss mitigation options, the term \u201cborrower\u201d includes a person whom the borrower has authorized to act on behalf of the borrower (a borrower's agent), and may include, for example, a housing counselor or attorney. The comment would have further explained that servicers may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if such person has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-1 reflects the Bureau's understanding that some delinquent borrowers may authorize third parties to assist them as they pursue alternatives to foreclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau sought to clarify that a servicer's obligation in proposed \u00a7 1024.40 extends to persons authorized to act on behalf of the borrower.", 
                        "Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-2 would have clarified that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1), a reasonable time for a transferee servicer to assign personnel to a borrower is by the end of the 30-day period of the transfer of servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-2 reflects the Bureau's belief that a transferee servicer may require some time after the transfer of servicing to identify delinquent borrowers who had personnel assigned to them by the transferor servicer. The Bureau believed that 30 days is a reasonable amount of time for a transferee servicer to assign personnel to a borrower whose mortgage loan has been transferred to the servicer through a servicing transfer. The Bureau invited comments on whether a longer time frame is appropriate.", 
                        "Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.i. would have explained that a servicer has discretion to determine the manner by which continuity of contact is implemented and reflected the Bureau's belief that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating the mortgage servicing industry may not be optimal, and thus servicers should be given flexibility to implement proposed \u00a7 1024.40 in the manner best suited to their particular circumstances. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-3.ii would have explained that \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) requires servicers to assign personnel to borrowers whom servicers are required to notify pursuant to \u00a7 1024.39(a). If a borrower whom a servicer is not required to notify pursuant to \u00a7 1024.39(a) contacts the servicer to explain that he or she expects to be late in making a particular payment, the comment would have explained that the servicer may assign personnel to the borrower upon its own initiative. Proposed comment 40(a)(1)-4 would have explained that proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1) does not permit or require a servicer to take any action inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case to avoid any potential conflict between the continuity of contact requirements and the automatic stay. The Bureau, however, invited comment on whether servicers should be required to continue providing delinquent borrowers continuity of contact after borrowers have filed for bankruptcy.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2) to require a servicer to make access to the assigned personnel available via telephone. If a borrower contacted the servicer and did not receive a live response from the assigned personnel, proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2) would have required that the borrower be able to record his or her contact information and that the servicer respond to the borrower within a reasonable time. Proposed comment 40(a)(2)-1 would have provided that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2), three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable time to respond. The Bureau intended comment 40(a)(2)-1 to function as a safe harbor because the Bureau believed in most cases, it would be reasonable to expect that borrowers receive a response within the proposed time frame. The Bureau invited comments on whether the Bureau should provide for a longer response time.", 
                        "As discussed above, consumer groups generally supported the Bureau's proposed continuity of contact requirements, but industry commenters urged the Bureau to make changes in various ways. With respect to proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(1), industry commenters overwhelmingly opposed the requirement that would have required a servicer to make contact personnel available to any borrower five days after a servicer has orally notified such borrower about the borrower's late payment in accordance with proposed \u00a7 1024.39(a). Commenters asserted that tying the assignment of contact staff to the oral notification requirement might require servicers to devote significant resources to assist borrowers who do not require formal loss mitigation assistance because in most cases, borrowers who are delinquent for 30 days or less self-cure. The commenters additionally asserted that the diversion of resources would adversely impact borrowers who actually need loss mitigation assistance by diverting servicer resources unnecessarily. One state credit union association suggested that there might be implementation challenges because servicers' current systems might not be set up to assign personnel based on a borrower's payment status.", 
                        "Industry commenters suggested alternative methods of assignment that they asserted would be more effective: (1) Delay assignment until borrowers become at least 45 days delinquent (the range was between 45 and 60 days); (2) permit servicers to rely on their internal policies and procedures to determine the timing of assignment; (3) require servicers to assign contact personnel to borrowers who request loss mitigation assistance, which could be demonstrated by either submitting a loss mitigation application or the first piece of documentation a servicer has requested from a borrower with respect to a loss mitigation application. Industry commenters who suggested the last alternative observed that limiting a servicer's obligation to assign contact personnel would be consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and thus would make compliance with the Bureau's proposed rule less costly to servicers who have already implemented systems changes to comply with the National Mortgage Settlement.", 
                        "With respect to comments received on proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2), one non-bank servicer expressed concern about whether proposed \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2) would have required servicers to track voicemail messages left in the voicemail box of individual staff members and urged the Bureau to change the requirement such that borrowers are transferred to available live representatives or require servicers to call borrowers back within some set amount of time. With respect to proposed comment 40(a)(2)-1, one national non-profit organization urged the Bureau to provide that a servicer may take five days to respond because it saw the three-day response time as a requirement that it could not meet because it is mostly staffed by volunteers. A non-bank servicer requested clarification whether the three-day response time is guidance or a requirement."

The functions would have been as follows: (1) Providing a borrower with accurate information about loss mitigation options offered by the servicer and available to the borrower based on information in the servicer's possession (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(A)), actions a borrower must take to be evaluated for loss mitigation options, including what the borrower must do to submit a complete loss mitigation application, as defined in proposed \u00a7 1024.41, and if applicable, what the borrower must do to appeal the servicer's denial of the borrower's application (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(B)), the status of the borrower's already-submitted loss mitigation application (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(C)), the circumstances under which a servicer must make a foreclosure referral (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(D)), and loss mitigation deadlines the servicer has established (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(i)(E)); (2) accessing a complete record of the borrower's payment history in the servicer's possession, all documents the borrower has submitted to the servicer in connection with the borrower's application for a loss mitigation option offered by the servicer, and if applicable, documents the borrower has submitted to prior servicers in connection with the borrower's application for loss mitigation options offered by those servicers, to the extent that those documents are in the servicer's possession (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(A through (C)); (3) providing the documents in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(B) through (C) to persons authorized to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options offered by the servicer if the servicer personnel assigned to the borrower is not authorized to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(iii)); and (4) within a reasonable time after a borrower request, provide the information to the borrower or inform the borrower of the telephone number and address the servicer has established for borrowers to assert an error pursuant to \u00a7 1024.35 or make an information request pursuant to \u00a7 1024.36 (proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(iv)). Proposed comment 40(b)(1)(iv) would have clarified that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(iv), three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable time to provide the information the borrower has requested or inform the borrower of the telephone number and address the servicer has established for borrowers to assert an error pursuant to \u00a7 1024.35 or make an information request pursuant to \u00a7 1024.36.", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) reflected the Bureau's belief that having staff available to help delinquent borrowers is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that when a borrower at a significant risk of default reaches out to a servicer for assistance, the borrower is connected to personnel who can address the borrower's inquiries or loss mitigation requests adequately. The staff a servicer makes available to delinquent borrowers must be able to perform functions that are calibrated toward, among other things, facilitating the review of borrowers for foreclosure avoidance options. Further, as discussed in the proposal, \u00a7 1024.40 was intended to work together with proposed \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 and 1024.41. For example, proposed \u00a7 1024.41 would have required a servicer to notify a borrower if the borrower has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application. Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) would have addressed this duty by requiring the personnel assigned to the borrower to inform the borrower about the steps the borrower must take to complete his or her loss mitigation application.", 
                        "The Bureau additionally proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) based on the recognition that mortgage investors and other regulators have responded to breakdowns in borrower-servicer communication by requiring servicers to adopt staffing standards. The Bureau believed that the functions set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) would have complemented existing standards. The Bureau did not receive comments in response to proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1), with the exception that two national consumer groups questioned whether proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would unnecessarily dilute a transferor servicer' responsibility to ensure it transfers all relevant borrower information and a transferee servicer's responsibility to ensure that it take possession of all such information because proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would have limited the transferred documents to ones in a transferee servicer's possession. The consumer groups also questioned whether \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1)(ii)(C) would have conflicted with proposed \u00a7 1024.38(b)(4), which would have required servicers to transfer all of the information and documents relating to a transferred mortgage loan. The Bureau observes that the limitation was proposed because the Bureau did not believe a transferee servicer should be exposed to potentially costly litigation if the lack of access to documents is due to the fault of the transferor servicer. The Bureau observes that several of the proposed objectives with respect to providing information or accessing information would have been limited to circumstances where the information was in the servicer's possession. This proposed limitation was intended to be a safeguard to help servicers manage costs arising from the litigation risk that would have been created by the existence of civil liability for violations of proposed \u00a7 1024.40. But because the Bureau has decided to finalize \u00a7 1024.40 such that there will be no private liability for violations of the provision, the Bureau is not adopting the safeguard.", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2) would have provided that a servicer's policies and procedures satisfy the requirements in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) if servicer personnel do not engage in a pattern or practice of failing to perform the functions set forth in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) where applicable. Proposed comment 40(b)(2)-1.i would have provided that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2), a servicer exhibits a pattern or practice of failing to perform such functions, with respect to a single borrower, if servicer personnel assigned to the borrower fail to perform any of the functions listed in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) where applicable on multiple occasions, such as, for example, repeatedly providing the borrower with inaccurate information about the status of the loss mitigation application the borrower has submitted. Proposed comment 40(b)(2)-1.ii would have explained that a servicer exhibits a pattern or practice of failing to perform such functions, with respect to a large number of borrowers, if servicer personnel assigned to the borrowers fail to perform any of the functions listed in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) in similar ways, such as, for example, providing a large number of borrowers with inaccurate information about the status of the loss mitigation applications the borrowers have submitted.", 
                        "The Bureau recognizes that contact personnel may occasionally make a mistake and fail to perform a function enumerated in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1). Proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2) reflects the Bureau's belief that the occasional mistake is not necessarily indicative of servicers not complying with the servicing obligation set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1). Accordingly, just as the Bureau proposed the safe harbor in proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(2) for servicers for non-systemic violations of \u00a7 1024.38 to manage the costs arising from the litigation risk created by the existence of civil liability for violations of \u00a7 1024.38, the Bureau proposed a safe harbor in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2) for servicers for non-systemic violations of \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1).", 
                        "Both consumer groups and industry commenters opposed the safe harbor the Bureau proposed in \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2). Just as consumer groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the proposed safe harbor in proposed \u00a7 1024.38(a)(2) to reduce barriers to successful litigation and to ensure that the rule provides protection for more borrowers, they urged the Bureau to withdraw proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2). Just as industry groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the pattern or practice private cause of action under \u00a7 1024.38(a)(2) to reduce significant litigation exposure, they urged the Bureau to do the same with respect to proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2). Moreover, as is true in the general servicing policies and procedures context, the Bureau is concerned that the safe harbor in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2) would hamper the Bureau and other regulators in exercising supervisory authority and could preclude relief from being secured until there have been widespread or repeated incidents of consumer harm. Further, the safe harbor is no longer necessary because, as discussed above, the Bureau has decided to finalize \u00a7 1024.40 such that there will be no private liability for violations of the provision. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting \u00a7 1024.40(b)(2) and related comments 40(b)(2)-1.i and ii. Instead, the Bureau is only adopting \u00a7 1024.40(b)(1) as \u00a7 1024.40(b)."

The Bureau observes that proposed &#167; 1024.40(c) clearly indicates that the Bureau intended &#167; 1024.40 to apply to more than just the initial assignment of contact personnel.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed comment 40(c)(3)-1 to provide that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(c)(3), a reasonable time has passed when the borrower has made on-time mortgage payments for three consecutive months. The Bureau noted in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal that the ability of a borrower to make on-time mortgage payments for three consecutive months has gained wide acceptance as an indicator of whether a previously-delinquent borrower can succeed in keeping his or her mortgage loan current. For example, under Treasury's HAMP program, a borrower is put in a trial modification period lasting three months. The borrower must have made all trial period payments to qualify for a permanent loan modification.\n            The Bureau sought comment on whether criteria other than a borrower making on-time mortgage payments for three consecutive months should be used to determine what is a \u201creasonable time\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(c)(3).", 
                        "A number of industry commenters asserted that three months of tracking a borrower who later becomes current would generally be excessive, particularly if the borrower cures without the aid of loan modification. Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to conform proposed \u00a7 1024.40(3) to the requirement in the National Mortgage Settlement, which permits a servicer to end the assignment of a single point of contact to a borrower upon the reinstatement of the loan, which occurs either due to voluntary reinstatement or the processing of a permanent loan modification program. They urged the Bureau to not discount a borrower's completion of a trial modification program, and several commenters urged servicers to count a borrower's trial modification payments toward meeting the proposed on-time payment requirement in \u00a7 1024.40(c)(3).", 
                        "One bank servicer suggested that the Bureau should further clarify proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c)(3) by replacing the phrase \u201con-time mortgage payment\u201d with \u201cwhen the borrower has made payment for three consecutive months that have not incurred a late fee.\u201d The servicer expressed the concern that narrowly interpreting \u201con-time\u201d payments as paying as of the due date could unnecessarily extend the duration of the continuity of contact and that the Bureau should take account of any grace period after the payment due date during which a borrower could pay without incurring a late fee.", 
                        "Proposed comment 40(c)(5)-1 would have provided that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(c)(5), a reasonable time would have passed 30 days after servicing for the borrower's mortgage loan was transferred to a transferee servicer. As discussed above, the Bureau believed that the transferee servicer may require up to 30 days from the date of transfer of servicing to identify borrowers who had personnel assigned to them by the transferor servicer.", 
                        "A large bank servicer and a national trade association representing large mortgage financing companies opposed requiring a transferor servicer to continue making continuity of contact personnel available to a borrower whose loan has been transferred because after servicing has been transferred, the transferor servicer would no long have access to any records or documents of the borrower and could no longer reasonably be expected to assist a borrower effectively. The large bank servicer suggested that if the Bureau adopts a rule that requires a transferor service to continue making continuity of contact personnel available after a borrower's loan has been transferred, the Bureau should require the assignment to last no more than 15 days following the transfer. The national trade association suggested that the Bureau should require contact information for the continuity of contact personnel made available by a transferee servicer be disclosed in the servicing transfer letter or provide an exemption for liability for potentially violating \u00a7 1024.40(b) as the personnel will be unable to perform many of the functions set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(b). One bank servicer recommended that the Bureau provide a safe harbor for situations where a continuity of contact personnel is no longer available due to staffing changes in the normal course of business.", 
                        "The Bureau has considered the comments the Bureau has received in response to proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) and is making several adjustments. The Bureau has reconsidered the appropriate continuity of contact objectives where a borrower's mortgage loan is made current through voluntary reinstatement. The Bureau believes that the objective should be to maintain continuity of contact until a borrower either brings a mortgage loan current by paying all amount owed in arrears or is able to make at least the first two payments following a permanent modification agreement. In the case of a borrower who brings her mortgage current, the Bureau believes that the likelihood of a near-term re-default is relatively low and thus the servicer should not be required to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain continuity of contact with such a borrower. On the other hand, The Bureau believes that the risk of a re-default for a borrower who has gone through formal loss mitigation assistance is sufficiently high that the servicer's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to maintain continuity of contact with such a borrower throughout any trial modification and for a period of time after the borrower enters into a permanent loan modification agreement. The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2), which reduces the number of consecutive monthly payments from three to two. This responds to concerns about whether three months of tracking might be excessive. The Bureau has also considered the request to permit a servicer to factor in grace periods when determining whether a payment was an on-time payment and believes that it would be an appropriate change. This change is reflected in final \u00a7 1024.40(a)(2).", 
                        "The Bureau has considered the issue of a transferor servicer's obligation to continue making contact personnel available to a borrower whose loan has been transferred. As discussed above, the Bureau reasoned that it might reasonably take some time for transferee servicers to identify borrower who had personnel assigned to them by the transferor servicer. The Bureau believes this safeguard is no longer necessary when violations of finalized \u00a7 1024.40 no longer expose a servicer to civil liability. Accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c)(5).", 
                        "As discussed above, one industry commenter suggested that the Bureau should relieve a servicer of its obligation to make continuity of contact personnel available due to staffing changes in the normal course of business. The Bureau disagrees. The Bureau expects that servicers already have existing policies and procedures in place to address the implication of staffing changes to their servicing operations, including the impact on borrower-servicer communications and accordingly, this limitation is unnecessary.", 
                        "As discussed above, after further consideration, the Bureau believes it would be better to state clearly in \u00a7 1024.40(a) that the continuity of contact policy and procedures requirements in \u00a7 1024.40 only applies to delinquent borrower rather than setting forth a separate section in proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) to the same effect. Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c) as a separate subsection of \u00a7 1024.40 and is instead moving the substance of proposed \u00a7 1024.40(c), revised as discussed above, to comment 40(a)-1, which elaborates on the meaning of the term \u201cdelinquent borrower\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(a). As adopted, comment 40(a)-1 clarifies that a borrower is no longer a \u201cdelinquent borrower\u201d (for purposes of \u00a7 1024.40(a)) if a borrower has refinanced the mortgage loan, paid off the mortgage loan, brought the mortgage loan current by paying all amounts owed in arrears, or if title to the borrower's property has been transferred to a new owner through, for example, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, a sale of the borrower's property, including, as applicable, a short sale, or a foreclosure sale."

Proposed comment 40(d)-1 would have explained that \u201cconditions beyond the servicer's control\u201d include natural disasters, wars, riots or other major upheaval, delays or failures caused by third parties, such as a borrower's delay or failure to submit any requested information, disruptions in telephone service, computer system malfunctions, and labor disputes, such as strikes. The Bureau intended proposed \u00a7 1024.40(d) to limit the liability of servicers to borrowers under RESPA. The Bureau did not believe that failures to comply with the continuity of contact requirements in proposed \u00a7 1024.40 caused by conditions beyond a servicer's control should expose a servicer to liability to a borrower under section 6 of RESPA. Even if servicers implement processes that would address staffing failures that had a significant adverse impact on borrowers seeking alternatives to foreclosure, the Bureau believes that such conditions may occasionally occur that could adversely affect a servicer's ability to provide adequate and appropriate staff to assist delinquent borrowers.", 
                        "One non-bank servicer recommended that the Bureau add to the list of conditions beyond a servicer's control circumstances under which a servicer cannot establish reasonable contact with a borrower or the borrower is not responsive to reasonable attempts to make contact. Another servicer asked the Bureau to provide that major business reorganizations, such as mergers, be added to the list of conditions beyond a servicer's control. In response to the first commenter, the Bureau observes that a servicer's obligation under proposed \u00a7 1024.40 would have been to simply make contact personnel available in accordance with \u00a7 1024.40(a). The contact personnel would not have been required by \u00a7 1024.40 to make multiple attempts to contact a borrower. Making multiple attempts to contact a borrower is also not an objective of \u00a7 1024.40 as adopted. In response to the second commenter, the Bureau observes that major business organizations typically require advanced negotiation and planning. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that such transactions should not be added to the list of conditions beyond a servicer's control.", 
                        "But importantly, the Bureau is withdrawing proposed \u00a7 1024.40(d) and related comment 40(d)-1. For reasons discussed above, violations of \u00a7 1024.40 will not give rise to civil liability. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that adopting proposed \u00a7 1024.40(d) is no longer necessary."

                                "Consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments requesting that the Bureau mandate criteria for loss mitigation programs. For example, twelve individual consumer advocacy groups, as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups, commented that the Bureau's proposal to require loss mitigation procedures did not go far enough to protect consumers from harms relating to the loss mitigation process.", 
                                "Many consumer advocate commenters set forth a list of goals that should be considered by the Bureau to guide the development of a fuller set of consumer protections relating to the loss mitigation process. These goals included: (1) The Bureau should mandate specific home-saving strategies, with affordable loan modifications ranked first and with an order of priority among types of modifications (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.</em> temporary or permanent interest rate reduction, extension of term, reduction of principal, <em data-original=\"E-03\">etc.</em>); (2) the Bureau should require all servicers to offer affordable, net present value positive loan modifications to qualified homeowners facing hardship and should establish rules for determining what constitutes an affordable modification by establishing a maximum or target debt-to-income ratio;\n            (3) the Bureau should require that successful trial loan modifications must be automatically converted to permanent modifications by servicers;\n            and (4) the Bureau should require servicers to notify homeowners regarding the status of evaluations for loss mitigation options in writing. Notably, one commenter stated that the Bureau should require that if a homeowner is ineligible for a loan modification option, a servicer should fully explore non-home retention options, such as cash-for-keys or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, with the homeowner before a foreclosure is filed.", 
                                "Mandatory loan modifications were addressed by a number of other comment submissions. A coalition of 60 consumer advocacy groups further commented that the Bureau should require loan modification programs similar to HAMP using a public and transparent net-present-value test mandated by the Bureau. One consumer advocacy group commented that a servicer should be required to offer loss mitigation when the servicer is a participant in a Federal, State, or private loss mitigation program or process. Further, one commenter stated that servicers should be prohibited from offering loss mitigation options that grossly deviate from standard industry practices. Finally, individual consumers that participated in a discussion of the proposed rules in connection with the Regulation Room project commented that the Bureau should mandate specific loan modification programs and requirements.", 
                                "On the other hand, three consumer advocacy groups expressly stated that the Bureau should not mandate specific loan modification programs and requirements. Although these groups advocated that the Bureau should mandate that all servicers engage in loss mitigation procedures and \u201cinclude loan modifications that reduce payments to an affordable level as one of the loss mitigation options generally available to borrowers,\u201d these groups recommended against prescribing specific loss mitigation criteria, specified waterfalls or debt-to-income targets, or net present value models or assumptions. Rather, these groups stated that servicers should be given discretion to implement loss mitigation programs. These groups did urge, however, that servicers should be responsible for implementing loss mitigation programs consistent with the requirements imposed by owners or assignees of mortgage loans with respect to the administration of those programs.", 
                                "In contrast with consumer advocates, industry commenters stated that regulations concerning loss mitigation procedures will limit the availability of loss mitigation options and restrict the availability of credit. Specifically, a community bank, a credit union, and a non-bank mortgage lender commented that mandating outcomes would be a disincentive to offering loss mitigation programs. Further, these commenters indicated that such programs would be costly and burdensome to implement. Further, a number of servicers, their trade associations, and a law firm stated that allowing a private right of action for loss mitigation options would substantially increase costs for lenders, limit the offering of loss mitigation options, and more generally, restrict the availability of credit.", 
                                "After careful consideration of the comments, the Bureau has decided to refrain at this time from mandating specific loss mitigation programs or outcomes. The Bureau continues to believe that it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to implement required procedures for servicers' evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options and that this approach will maintain consumer access to credit.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that mandating specific loss mitigation programs or outcomes might adversely affect the housing market and the ability of consumers to access affordable credit. Even in its current constrained state, the mortgage market generates approximately $1.4 trillion dollars in new loans.\n            The mortgage market necessarily depends on a large number of creditors, investors, and guarantors who are willing to accept the credit risk entailed in mortgage lending. The market is constrained today at least in part because, in the wake of the financial crisis, private capital is largely unwilling to accept that risk without a government guarantee.", 
                                "As with any secured lending, those who take the credit risk on mortgage loans do so in part in reliance on their security interest in the collateral. When a borrower is unable (or unwilling) to repay a loan, it is in the interest of those who own the loans to attempt to mitigate (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> reduce) their losses. There are myriad options, ranging from forbearance, to loan modification, to short sales, to foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to achieve that end. Further, there is a wide range of borrower situations regarding which the borrower and owner or assignee of the mortgage loan must make judgments as to the desirable options. And for any given situation with respect to a borrower's willingness and ability to pay, there are a large number of issues to resolve in determining how to structure a particular option, such as a forbearance plan, loan modification, or short sale.", 
                                "The Bureau understands that different creditors, investors, and guarantors have differing perspectives on how best to achieve loss mitigation based in part on their own individual circumstances and structures and in part on their market judgments and assessments. Community banks and credit unions with loans on portfolio may have a different viewpoint, for example, than large investors who purchased mortgage loans on the secondary market. Even government insurance programs adopt approaches that differ in material respects from each other, as well as from those programs implemented by the GSEs.", 
                                "The Bureau does not believe that it can develop, at this time, rules that are sufficiently calibrated to protect the interests of all parties involved in the loss mitigation process and is concerned that an attempt to do so may have unintended negative consequences for consumers and the broader market. Loss mitigation programs have evolved significantly since the onset of the financial crisis and the Bureau is concerned that an attempt to mandate specific loss mitigation outcomes risks impeding innovation, that would allow such programs to evolve to the needs of the market. The Bureau further believes that if it were to attempt to impose substantive loss mitigation rules on the market at this time, consumers' access to affordable credit could be adversely affected. Creditors who were otherwise prepared to assume the credit risk on mortgages might be unwilling to do so, or might charge a higher price (interest rate) because they would no longer be able to establish their own criteria for determining when to offer a loss mitigation option in the event of a borrower's default. Investors in the secondary market might likewise reduce their willingness to invest in mortgage securities or pay less for securities at present rates (thereby requiring creditors to charge higher interest rates to maintain the same yield). The cost of servicing might increase substantially to compensate servicers for the burden of complying with prescribed criteria for evaluation of loss mitigation applications. Based upon these considerations, the Bureau declines to prescribe specific loss mitigation criteria at this time.", 
                                "The Bureau is implementing requirements, however, for servicers to evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to guidelines established by the owner or assignee of a borrower's mortgage loan. In order to effectuate this policy, the Bureau has created certain requirements in \u00a7 1024.38, with respect to general servicing policies, procedures, and requirements, and other requirements in connection with the loss mitigation procedures in \u00a7 1024.41. Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38, servicers are required to maintain policies and procedures to achieve the objective of (1) identifying, with specificity, all loss mitigation options for which borrowers may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by an owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan and (2) properly evaluating a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options for which the borrower may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Further, in \u00a7 1024.41, the Bureau is implementing procedural protections for borrowers with respect to the process of obtaining an evaluation for loss mitigation options, as well as restrictions on the foreclosure process while a borrower is being evaluated for a loss mitigation option. Borrowers have a private right of action to enforce the procedural requirements in \u00a7 1024.41, as set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(a); borrowers do not, however, have a private right of action under the Bureau's rules to enforce the requirements set forth in \u00a7 1024.38 or to enforce the terms of an agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan with respect to the evaluation of borrowers for loss mitigation options. The Bureau believes this framework provides an appropriate mortgage servicing standard; servicers must implement the loss mitigation programs established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans and borrowers are entitled to receive certain protections regarding the process (but not the substance) of those evaluations.", 
                                "In reaching the conclusion not to impose substantive requirements on loss mitigation programs, such as eligibility criteria, or to mandate the outcomes of loss mitigation processes, the Bureau recognizes that there is abundant evidence that the current system is not producing a level of loan modifications and other foreclosure alternatives that best meets the interests of distressed borrowers, the communities that would be hurt by borrowers' loss of their homes, and owners or assignees of mortgage loans. To the extent that is the result of process failures by servicers\u2014specifically, the lack of infrastructure to handle the flood of delinquent borrowers resulting from the financial crisis\u2014the Bureau believes that it can best contribute to solving that problem through the rules it is adopting which, as previously discussed, will require servicers to establish policies and procedures governing servicer operations, to implement continuity of contact policies and procedures, to engage in early intervention with delinquent borrowers, and to comply with procedures regarding the evaluation of a borrower for loss mitigation options. Together, these requirements are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA.", 
                                "To the extent the failure of the current system to produce an optimal level of loss mitigation is the result of servicers pursuing their self-interest rather than the interest of their principals (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.</em> the owners or assignees of the mortgage loans), the Bureau is addressing that issue by requiring servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify all available loss mitigation options of their principals and properly consider delinquent borrowers for all such options.", 
                                "The Bureau observes that the vast bulk of delinquent mortgages today are owned or guaranteed by governmental agencies such as FHA or by the GSEs in conservatorship. Those agencies, and the FHFA as conservator for the GSEs, are accountable to the public for meeting their statutory responsibilities to borrowers and taxpayers. The Bureau believes these agencies are best situated to establish loss mitigation programs for their mortgage loans, to determine the extent to which they believe it appropriate to allow individual borrowers to enforce their loss mitigation rules, and to evaluate whether a borrower should be able to obtain judicial review of the decision of a servicer in an individual case to offer a loss mitigation option. If the Bureau were to effectively mandate such review, the Bureau fears that investors and guarantors might dilute the obligations they impose on servicers or the loss mitigation options they make available. Such a result would not serve the interests of consumer or the housing market. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined not to establish substantive criteria for review of loss mitigation programs at this time and not to make investor guidelines with respect to loss mitigation enforceable against servicers by borrowers through RESPA. The Bureau will continue to monitor developments in the market and work with the prudential regulators, as well as other Federal agencies, to assess collectively whether additional rules are necessary and appropriate to improve outcomes for all participants in the mortgage market.", 
                                "Although the Bureau is not mandating specific loss mitigation criteria and, instead, is adopting a procedural approach, the Bureau is finalizing the loss mitigation procedures as proposed with significant adjustments, as set forth below, that are designed to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed procedures in light of the public comments. Such adjustments include, for example, expanding the scope of the loss mitigation procedures to apply to all servicers, not just servicers that offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business, adjusting the timelines for the loss mitigation procedures, and implementing protections for borrowers from the harms of dual tracking. Although the Bureau believes that substantially all, if not all, servicers offer loss mitigation options, as defined by the Bureau, in the ordinary course of business, the Bureau acknowledges, and agrees with, comments received from consumer advocates that requiring servicers to comply with the loss mitigation requirements notwithstanding their business practices better achieves the consumer protection purposes of RESPA.", 
                                "As set forth more fully below (and above with respect to \u00a7 1024.38), the Bureau is also making adjustments to other sections of the rule to address concerns raised by certain consumer advocate commenters related to loss mitigation. For example, \u00a7 1024.38 requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement the loss mitigation program requirements established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Such programs may require servicers to consider whether a borrower's material change in financial circumstances warrants further consideration of the availability of loss mitigation options and may require consideration of loss mitigation applications beyond the timelines required by the Bureau. Although the Bureau has determined not to adjust the loss mitigation procedures requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 to address such concerns, the Bureau has made adjustments to the requirements for servicers to adopt policies and procedures in \u00a7 1024.38, as set forth above, which has the effect of addressing such concerns."

Timely applications included complete loss mitigation applications submitted within a deadline established by a servicer, which could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. By prohibiting servicers from proceeding to a foreclosure sale while a complete and timely loss mitigation application is pending, the proposed rule would have addressed one of the most direct consumer harms resulting from concurrent evaluation of loss mitigation options and prosecution of foreclosure proceedings.", 
                                "The comments from consumer advocacy groups regarding dual tracking set forth three distinct themes: (1) Borrowers should have the opportunity to be reviewed for a loss mitigation option before a servicer begins a foreclosure process, (2) borrowers should not receive inconsistent communications relating to, or incur costs for, continuing the foreclosure process when a loss mitigation review is underway, and (3) borrowers should receive the protection of required loss mitigation procedures closer in time to the date of a foreclosure sale than 90 days. The first two of these themes are addressed here and the third is addressed below with respect to timelines.", 
                                "Consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments stating that although the Bureau's proposal would address harms resulting from a foreclosure sale, other harms to consumers relating to dual tracking were not addressed by the proposed rule. These included consumer harms resulting from participating in the foreclosure process, including confusion from receiving inconsistent and confusing foreclosure communications, while loss mitigation reviews are on-going. Such harm potentially may lead to failures by borrowers to complete loss mitigation processes that may have more beneficial consequences for borrowers as well as owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, borrowers may be negatively impacted because borrowers are responsible for accruing foreclosure costs while an application for a loss mitigation option is under review. These costs burden already struggling borrowers and may impact the evaluation and ultimate outcome for a borrower for a loss mitigation option.", 
                                "These commenters recommended that the Bureau restrict servicers from pursuing the foreclosure process and evaluating a borrower for loss mitigation options on dual tracks. For example, twelve individual consumer advocacy groups, as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups stated that the Bureau should require servicers to undertake loss mitigation evaluations, including loan modification reviews and offers, prior to beginning the foreclosure process. These commenters further stated that homeowners applying for loss mitigation options after a foreclosure has started should have their foreclosures paused while their files are reviewed, and if needed, appealed, in a timely fashion. Further, three consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should create a defined pre-foreclosure period of 120 days before a borrower can be referred to foreclosure. This period should also have a mandatory review of a borrower before proceeding with foreclosure.", 
                                "Industry commenters also addressed whether the Bureau should implement protections relating to dual tracking apart from the prohibition on foreclosure sale set forth in the proposal. Outreach with servicers and their trade associations indicated general support for maintaining consistency among any \u201cdual tracking\u201d requirements established by the Bureau and the National Mortgage Settlement. A law firm commented that the Bureau's requirements with respect to \u201cdual tracking\u201d should model the National Mortgage Settlement. Notably, a community bank and its trade association commented that, as a consequence of the Bureau's regulations on loss mitigation procedures, servicers may try to begin foreclosures as soon as possible after delinquency in order to evade the requirements of the Bureau's loss mitigation procedures and preserve flexibility in handling the foreclosure process.", 
                                "The Bureau is persuaded by the comments that the potential harm to consumers of commencing a foreclosure proceeding before the consumer has had a reasonable opportunity to submit a loss mitigation application or while a complete loss mitigation application is pending is substantial. The fact that the GSEs and the National Mortgage Settlement both prohibit servicers from commencing foreclosure for a specified period of time to afford a borrower a reasonable opportunity to apply for a loss mitigation option is further persuasive that providing borrowers with the same protection would advance the consumer protection purposes of RESPA and would not present a significant risk of unintended consequences.", 
                                "Accordingly, in light of the comments, the Bureau has determined to implement restrictions on dual tracking beyond those set forth in the proposal. These restrictions have three main components. First, the Bureau is prohibiting a servicer of a mortgage loan subject to \u00a7 1024.41 from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent. After a borrower is 120 days delinquent, a servicer may make the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless the borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application, in which case, the servicer must complete the review and appeal procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.41 before starting the foreclosure process. If a borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option, such as a trial modification, the servicer may not commence the foreclosure process.", 
                                "Second, the Bureau is expanding and clarifying the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale. If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application by an applicable deadline, as discussed below, a servicer must complete the loss mitigation procedures before proceeding to a foreclosure judgment, obtaining an order of sale for the property, or conducting a foreclosure sale. As set forth below, the Bureau has clarified that proceeding to a foreclosure judgment includes filing a dispositive motion, such as a motion for a default judgment, judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, which may result in the issuance of a foreclosure judgment. If such a motion is pending when a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application, the servicer should take reasonable steps to avoid a ruling on such motion until completing the loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau is also finalizing the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale if a borrower is performing under a trial modification or other agreed upon loss mitigation option.", 
                                "Third, as set forth below with respect to timelines, the Bureau is implementing procedures applicable to the evaluation of complete loss mitigation applications submitted by borrowers less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale, but 37 days or more before a foreclosure sale. These procedures expand the protections from the harms of dual tracking to borrowers that submit complete loss mitigation applications closer in time to a foreclosure sale. The Bureau received comments from consumer advocates in states with non-judicial foreclosure processes that operate on relatively short timelines indicating that consumers in such states may not benefit from the protections implemented by the Bureau. The Bureau agrees with these comments and is implementing protections on dual tracking that address different timing scenarios. The Bureau believes that such provisions are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring that consumers in all jurisdictions have an opportunity to submit a complete loss mitigation application and avoid certain of the harms resulting from dual tracking.", 
                                "The Bureau is not, however, otherwise mandating a pause in foreclosure proceedings if a loss mitigation application is submitted after a foreclosure proceeding has been commenced. Once the foreclosure process is initiated, there are typically timelines for the steps that follow that are established by state law or, in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, by court rules or orders entered in individual cases. Those timelines and steps vary from state to state and even from case to case. Some of these timelines and steps have been implemented to ensure that consumers receive the benefit of disclosures or processes enacted by state law to assist consumers. So long as a servicer does not proceed with a dispositive motion in a foreclosure action, the Bureau does not believe that the benefits that might accrue to borrowers from mandating a pause in a foreclosure proceeding (which pause may last for up to 88 days under the timelines the Bureau is mandating for resolving loss mitigation applications) are justified by the disruption that might result to state court proceedings from a mandated pause and the risk of a loss mitigation application being submitted strategically to delay or derail the foreclosure process.", 
                                "The Bureau recognizes that requiring a pause in foreclosures while a complete loss mitigation application is being considered would create incentives for servicers to address such applications expeditiously. The Bureau believes, however, that the best way to address this issue is by mandating strict deadlines for review of a complete loss mitigation application, as the Bureau is doing, and providing for enforcement of those deadlines through private rights of action. The Bureau also recognizes that a pause could reduce costs to borrowers that would otherwise be incurred for the foreclosure process while a loss mitigation application is under review. However, so long as a servicer adheres to the timelines established by the Bureau, the Bureau does not believe that these costs are likely to be substantial."

                                "The proposed rule would have required mortgage servicers to comply with the procedures set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.41 with respect to a complete loss mitigation application that was received by a deadline established by a servicer, which deadline could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. In the proposal, the Bureau stated that a 90-day threshold set an appropriate line because a servicer who received a complete loss mitigation application 90 days before a foreclosure sale would have 30 days to review a borrower's application for a loss mitigation option, would be able to provide the borrower with 14 days to respond to the servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option and/or to file an appeal, would be able to consider any timely appeal during a subsequent 30 day period, and would be able to provide the borrower with an additional 14 days to respond to any offer of a loss mitigation option after an appeal. Thus, with the timeline set forth, a servicer would be able to complete the entire process within 88 days and a 90 day deadline could accommodate completing the process without rescheduling the foreclosure sale. Proposed comment 41(f)-1 would have clarified that where a foreclosure sale had not been scheduled, or where a foreclosure sale could occur less than 90 days after the sale is scheduled pursuant to State law, a servicer should establish a deadline that is no earlier than 90 days before the day that a servicer reasonably anticipates that a foreclosure sale will be scheduled.", 
                                "Although some servicers and a trade association indicated support for the 90 day maximum deadline, in general, commenters indicated substantial disagreement regarding the appropriate deadlines and framework for structuring timing requirements for reviewing loss mitigation applications. A substantial number of consumer advocacy groups objected to the underlying premise of the deadline requirement. In addition to establishing timeframes prior to a foreclosure referral, as discussed above, consumer advocacy groups stated that borrowers should be permitted to provide complete loss mitigation applications less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale and receive the protection of the procedures required by the Bureau. A housing counselor and three consumer advocacy groups indicated that the deadline should be extended until a maximum of 14 days before a foreclosure sale. Another consumer advocacy group stated that the deadline should be no more than 7 days before a foreclosure sale. These commenters further recommended postponing a foreclosure sale if an application received at least 14 days before a sale is still in the review process by 14 days before a sale to allow time for review and appeals. Further, consumer advocacy groups operating in states with non-judicial foreclosure processes with relatively short timelines stated that borrowers may not be able to benefit from the loss mitigation procedures established by the Bureau within the 90-day deadline set forth in the proposal.", 
                                "Conversely, banks, credit unions, and non-bank servicers, as well as their trade associations, objected to the proposed 90 day deadline requirement because it would purportedly provide too much time for borrowers to pursue loss mitigation applications. Two credit unions, two large banks, and two non-bank servicers objected to the 90 day deadline on the basis that the rules should encourage borrowers to seek assistance at the earliest possible time while the delinquency may be curable and allow the borrower to retain the home. A non-bank servicer stated that it appreciated the 90 day deadline but indicated that this deadline could be so far after an initial delinquency in certain jurisdictions that it may lead to a borrower submitting an application after so much time has passed that no option could reasonably assist the borrower with curing a delinquency. Further, a non-bank servicer suggested the Bureau implement staged timelines rather than requiring servicers to establish timelines that may be inconsistent with state law.\n            \n          ", 
                                "In light of the comments, the Bureau has reconsidered the proposed approach to timelines for the loss mitigation procedures and has made certain adjustments. The Bureau is persuaded that, however regrettable, some borrowers simply may not be prepared to come to terms with their situations and explore the availability of loss mitigation options until foreclosure is close at hand. The Bureau also is persuaded that it is necessary, and appropriate, to implement protections for consumers that apply for loss mitigation options closer in time to a foreclosure sale than 90 days. At the same time, the Bureau is cognizant that if applications received at the last moment were allowed to unduly delay a foreclosure from proceeding, there is a risk that the application process could be used tactically to stall foreclosure. Given that foreclosure timelines are already very long in many jurisdictions; given that the Bureau is implementing protections to mandate early communication with borrowers regarding loss mitigation options; and given that the Bureau is prohibiting servicers from proceeding to foreclosure unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent to ensure that borrowers have the opportunity to apply for loss mitigation options early in the delinquency timeline; the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to permit applications provided shortly before a foreclosure sale to delay the foreclosure.", 
                                "Accordingly, as set forth below, instead of setting an overall deadline for the loss mitigation procedures, the Bureau is implementing timelines that provide different loss mitigation processes with differing levels of protection at certain stages of the foreclosure process. These requirements are: (1) Pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2), a servicer must comply with the requirements relating to acknowledgement of a loss mitigation application and notice of additional documents and information required to complete a loss mitigation application for any loss mitigation application received 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale; (2) pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1), a servicer must evaluate within 30 days any complete loss mitigation application received more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale; (3) pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(e)(1), if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale, the servicer must provide the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option; if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale, the servicer must provide the borrower at least 7 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option; and (4) pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(h)(1), a servicer must comply with the appeal process for any complete loss mitigation application received 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale. Applying these timelines together yields four timing scenarios depending upon when a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Scenario 1.</em> If a borrower is less than 120 days delinquent, or if a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent but the servicer has not made the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process, and a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, (2) must allow the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option, and (3) must permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to &#167; 1024.41(h)(1). Further, for all loss mitigation applications received in this timeframe, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. The servicer may not make the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless these procedures are completed.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Scenario 2.</em> If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application after a servicer has made the first notice or filing for a foreclosure process, but 90 days or more exist before a foreclosure sale, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, (2) must allow the borrower at least 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option, and (3) must permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to &#167; 1024.41(h). Further, for all loss mitigation applications received in this timeframe, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. The servicer may not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, unless these procedures are completed.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Scenario 3.</em> If a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application after a servicer has made the first notice or filing for a foreclosure process, and less than 90 days, but more than 37 days, exist before a foreclosure sale, the servicer (1) must review the complete loss mitigation application within 30 days, and (2) must allow the borrower at least 7 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option. The servicer is not required to permit the borrower to appeal the denial of a loan modification option pursuant to &#167; 1024.41(h)(1). Further, the servicer must comply with the requirements for acknowledging a loss mitigation application and providing notice of additional information and documents necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete only if the loss mitigation application was received 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale. The servicer may not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, unless these procedures are completed.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Scenario 4.</em> None of the loss mitigation procedures apply to a loss mitigation application, including a complete loss mitigation application, received 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale. Servicers are required, however, pursuant to &#167; 1024.38 to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. As set forth below, nothing in &#167; 1024.41 excuses a servicer from complying with additional requirements imposed by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, the GSEs require servicers to engage in certain procedures to review loss mitigation applications submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale, and servicers may be required by the GSEs to comply with those requirements. The requirement to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan includes timelines established by any such owner or assignee of a mortgage loan."

                                "In order to reduce burden to servicers and costs to borrowers, the Bureau has sought to maintain consistency among \u00a7 1024.41, the National Mortgage Settlement, FHFA's servicing alignment initiative, Federal regulatory agency consent orders, and State law mortgage servicing statutory requirements. In certain instances, each of these other sources of servicing requirements may be more restrictive or prescriptive than \u00a7 1024.41. That is intentional. Section 1024.41 establishes standard consumer protections and provides flexibility for Federal regulatory agency requirements, State law, or investor and guarantor requirements to impose obligations that may be more restrictive on servicers.", 
                                "Servicers should comply with the most restrictive requirements to which they are subject. For example, \u00a7 1024.41 imposes requirements with respect to complete loss mitigation applications received more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. This is consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and GSE requirements.\n            Notably, the National Mortgage Settlement and GSE requirements impose obligations to conduct an expedited loss mitigation evaluation for servicers with respect to loss mitigation applications received 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale (although in certain circumstances the servicer is not necessarily required to complete the review before foreclosure). Nothing in \u00a7 1024.41 prohibits or impedes a servicer from complying with these requirements and servicers may be required to comply with requirements that are more prescriptive than the regulations implemented by the Bureau. Indeed, as noted, \u00a7 1024.38 requires servicers to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of evaluating borrower for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Similarly, if a servicer is required to proactively engage with a borrower to evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option prior to engaging in a mandatory mediation or arbitration process, \u00a7 1024.41 does not prohibit a servicer from obtaining a loss mitigation application before such process so long as the servicer complies with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.41 with respect to such application."

                        "As discussed in the Bureau's 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, and in part II above, there has been widespread concern among mortgage market participants, consumer advocates, and policymakers regarding pervasive problems with servicers' performance of loss mitigation activity in connection with the financial crisis, including lost documents, non-responsive servicers, and unwillingness to work with borrowers to reach agreement on loss mitigation options. In response, servicers, investors, guarantors, and State and Federal regulators have undertaken efforts to adjust servicer loss mitigation and foreclosure practices to address problems relating to evaluation of loss mitigation options. Specifically: (1) Treasury and HUD sponsored the Making Home Affordable program, which established guidelines for Federal government sponsored loss mitigation programs such as HAMP;\n            (2) the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to align their guidelines for servicing delinquent mortgages they own or guarantee to improve servicing practices;\n            (3) prudential regulators, including the Board and the OCC, undertook enforcement actions against major servicers, resulting in consent orders imposing requirements on servicing practices;\n            (4) the National Mortgage Settlement agreement imposes obligations on five of the largest servicers, including on the conduct of loss mitigation evaluations;\n            and (5) a number of States have adopted, and others continue to propose, regulations relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing, including requiring evaluation for loss mitigation options.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Many of these initiatives imposed a similar set of consumer protective practices on covered servicers with respect to delinquent borrowers. For example, the FHFA servicing alignment initiative, the National Mortgage Settlement, and HAMP all require servicers to review loss mitigation applications within 30 days.\n            Further, the FHFA servicing alignment initiative and the National Mortgage Settlement require a servicer that receives an application for a loss mitigation option from a borrower before the 120th day of delinquency to postpone the referral of the borrower's mortgage loan account to foreclosure until the borrower has been evaluated for a loss mitigation option.\n            \n          ", 
                        "While these various initiatives are starting to bring standardization to significant portions of the market, none of them to date has established a set of consistent national procedures and expectations regarding loss mitigation procedures. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, observing that the mortgage servicing industry was unprepared and poorly structured to address the rapid increase in defaults and foreclosures, recommended that federal regulators establish national mortgage servicing standards to address structural vulnerability in the mortgage servicing market.\n            Further, the GAO recommended that to the extent federal regulators create national servicing standards, such standards should address servicer foreclosure practices.\n            \n          ", 
                        "In response to these recommendations, the Bureau has developed these final rules to serve as national mortgage servicing standards. The Bureau believes that because so many borrowers are more than 90 days delinquent and in need of consideration for loss mitigation, because borrowers often are not able to choose the servicer of their mortgage loan, and because the manner in which loss mitigation is handled has such potentially significant impacts on both individual consumers and the health of the larger housing market and economy, establishing national mortgage servicing standards is necessary and appropriate to protect borrowers and achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA. Such standards establish appropriate expectations for loss mitigation processes for borrowers and for owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Such standards also ensure that borrowers have a full and fair opportunity to receive an evaluation for a loss mitigation option before suffering the harms associated with foreclosure. These standards are appropriate and necessary to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including facilitating borrowers' review for loss mitigation options, and to further the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure a fair, transparent, and competitive market for mortgage servicing.", 
                        "As stated in the proposal, the Bureau has considered a number of different options for addressing consumer harms relating to loss mitigation. In general, the Federal government has at least three approaches to addressing loss mitigation: (1) Establishing processes to facilitate actions by market participants; (2) mandating outcomes of loss mitigation process (implicitly raising costs to market participants of pursuing foreclosure actions in violation of the mandated outcomes); or (3) providing subsidies to incent the desired outcomes.\n            Only options (1) and (2) were considered by the Bureau in light of resources and other factors. These present a stark choice: Whether to mandate processes that provide consumer protections without mandating specific outcomes or whether to mandate specific outcomes by establishing criteria for when such outcomes are required. For example, a requirement that a servicer review a completed loss mitigation application in a certain time period establishes a process requirement but does not impose upon the servicer a criterion for determining whether to offer a loss mitigation option. In contrast, a requirement that a servicer provide a loan modification when an evaluation of a loss mitigation application indicates that a loan modification may have a positive net present value would impose a substantive criterion. Mandating a methodology or set of assumptions for determining when a modification has a positive net present value would further constrain the investor's discretion in deciding under what circumstances to offer a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "The 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal included proposed procedural requirements for servicers to follow in reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1024.41 provided that servicers that make loss mitigation options available to borrowers in the ordinary course of business must undertake certain duties in connection with the evaluation of borrower applications for loss mitigation options. The proposal was intended to achieve three main goals: First, it was designed to provide protections to borrowers to ensure that, to the extent a servicer offers loss mitigation options, a borrower would receive timely information about how to apply, and that a servicer would evaluate a complete application in a timely manner. Second, it was designed to prohibit a servicer from completing a foreclosure process by proceeding with a foreclosure sale until a borrower and a servicer had terminated discussions regarding loss mitigation options.\n            Third, it was designed to set timelines for loss mitigation evaluation that could be completed without requiring a suspension of the foreclosure sale date in order to avoid strategic use of these procedures to extend foreclosure timelines.", 
                        "The Bureau intended that the protections that were set forth in proposed \u00a7 1024.41 would have been augmented and supplemented by protections in other sections of the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal that addressed loss mitigation issues. In proposed \u00a7 1024.39, for instance, the Bureau proposed to implement obligations on servicers that would have required servicers to contact borrowers early in the delinquency process and to provide information to borrowers regarding loss mitigation options. In proposed \u00a7 1024.40, the Bureau proposed to implement obligations on servicers that would have required servicers, in certain circumstances to provide borrowers with contact personnel to assist them with the process of applying for a loss mitigation option. Such personnel would have been required to have access to, among other things, information regarding loss mitigation options available to the borrower, actions the borrower must take to be evaluated for such loss mitigation options, and the status of any loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower. Further, in proposed \u00a7 1024.38, the Bureau proposed to require that servicers implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options. Finally, in proposed \u00a7 1024.35, the Bureau proposed to permit a borrower to assert an error as a result of a servicer's failure to postpone a scheduled foreclosure sale when a servicer has failed to comply with the requirements for proceeding with a foreclosure sale. The Bureau believed that all of these protections, when implemented together, would have a substantial impact on reducing consumer harm.", 
                        "The Bureau requested comment on all aspects of the proposal, and, in particular, whether focusing on the provision of procedural rights was the appropriate approach to addressing the consumer harm it had identified. The Bureau sought comment on whether there were additional appropriate measures that could be required to improve loss mitigation outcomes for all parties. The Bureau also sought comment on whether the proposed requirements ensured that consumers' timely and complete applications would receive fair and full consideration and ensured the predictability of outcomes for consumers as well as owners and assignees of mortgage loans. Finally, and as discussed further below, the Bureau sought comment on whether proposed \u00a7 1024.41 would have required servicers to undertake practices that conflicted with other Federal regulatory requirements or State law or may have caused servicers to undertake practices that might reduce the availability of loss mitigation options or access to credit.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau received comments from numerous individual consumers, consumer advocates, as well as some servicers and industry trade associations in support of the Bureau's implementation of loss mitigation procedures. Although many of these commenters indicated specific areas where adjustments to the proposed requirements might be warranted, a number of commenters indicated that the loss mitigation procedures proposed by the Bureau would provide necessary and appropriate tools to assist consumers in receiving evaluations for loss mitigation options. Other commenters disagreed with the Bureau's proposed approach with respect to loss mitigation requirements. Numerous consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau's proposed requirements were inadequate to address consumer harm, and that the Bureau should more aggressively regulate loss mitigation activities. Conversely, the majority of industry participants and their trade associations commented that the proposed requirements were burdensome, unnecessary to address consumer harm, and could create an incentive for servicers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans to withdraw current loss mitigation practices.", 
                        "Consumer advocacy groups primarily commented on three main topics: (1) Mandating specific loss mitigation criteria; (2) addressing consumer harms relating to dual tracking of processes for pursuing foreclosures and evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation; and (3) appropriate timelines for the loss mitigation procedures. These topics are addressed in turn below. In certain circumstances, because the Bureau's approach to loss mitigation is not limited to the loss mitigation procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.41, but involves a coordinated use of tools set forth in different provisions of the mortgage servicing rules (including the error resolution procedures in \u00a7 1024.35, the reasonable information management policies and procedures in \u00a7 1024.38, the early intervention requirements in \u00a7 1024.39, and the continuity of contact requirements in \u00a7 1024.40), the Bureau has implemented adjustments to other provisions in light of the comments received with respect to the loss mitigation procedures in \u00a7 1024.41 as discussed further below and in the discussions of the other sections as appropriate."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(a) would have required any servicer that offers loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41. The purpose of this section was to clarify that the requirements in proposed \u00a7 1024.41 are applicable only to those servicers that are engaged in a practice, in the ordinary course of business, of evaluating loss mitigation options for their own portfolios or pursuant to duties owed to investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Further, proposed comment 41(a)-1 clarified that nothing in proposed \u00a7 1024.41 was intended to impose a duty on a servicer to offer loss mitigation options to borrowers generally or to offer or approve any particular borrower for a loss mitigation option. As set forth in the 2012 RESPA Servicing Proposal, the Bureau did not intend to create a private right of action for borrowers to enforce, in private litigation, any requirements that are imposed by owners or assignees of mortgage loans (including investors or guarantors) on servicers to mitigate losses for such parties. Rather, the Bureau intended that borrowers could enforce the loss mitigation procedures against servicers to ensure that servicers complied with the appropriate procedural steps before completing the foreclosure process when a borrower had submitted a complete loss mitigation application.", 
                        "If a servicer did not evaluate borrowers for loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business, the servicer would not have been subject to proposed \u00a7 1024.41. In proposed comment 41(a)-2, the Bureau set forth examples of practices that, by themselves, would not have been considered indicia that a servicer had opted to offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau notes, however, that the proposed definition of loss mitigation options in \u00a7 1024.31, however, was expansive, encompassing not just loan modifications, but also forbearance plans, short sale agreements, and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure programs. The Bureau believes that substantially all, if not all, servicers offer these loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business.", 
                        "Consumer advocate commenters stated that the loss mitigation procedures should not be limited to mortgage servicers that offered loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. These commenters stated that the recent financial crisis has demonstrated that reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options has risen to the level of a standard servicer duty that should be expected of all mortgage servicers. Further, industry commenters did not take issue with the concept that engaging in loss mitigation should be considered a standard servicer duty. Rather, comments from industry focused instead on whether prescriptive loss mitigation requirements would adversely affect the manner in which servicers engage in reviews of borrowers for loss mitigation options. Specifically, a number of large banks and their trade associations stated that a private right of action for loss mitigation was a particular concern. These commenters indicated that borrowers should not be entitled to bring an action to enforce loss mitigation requirements set forth by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan or a voluntary loss mitigation program (such as HAMP). In addition, the Bureau's outreach and additional analysis raised questions regarding whether the scope of the loss mitigation provisions should be limited to a borrower's principal residence consistent with other governmental initiatives.", 
                        "Community banks, credit unions, and their trade associations commented that the loss mitigation procedures (and other rulemakings not specifically required by the Dodd-Frank Act) should exempt small servicers. These commenters also argued that the definition of small servicers should be large enough to cover most credit unions and community banks. A trade association for reverse mortgage lenders commented that reverse mortgage servicers should be exempt from the proposed rules. Further, four farm credit system institutions stated that they should be exempt because they are required to comply with distressed borrower regulations promulgated by the Farm Credit Administration in 12 CFR part 617. A nonprofit lender commented that bona-fide nonprofits should be exempt from the mortgage servicing rules.", 
                        "The Bureau has adjusted \u00a7 1024.41(a) in response to the public comments. First, the Bureau has revised \u00a7 1024.41(a) to eliminate the limitation on the loss mitigation procedures to only those servicers that offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business. The Bureau has not identified from the comments or outreach any servicers that did not offer loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by the Bureau and would not have been subject to \u00a7 1024.41 as proposed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that owners or assignees of mortgage loans should determine whether they will offer loss mitigation options and, if so, the Bureau does not believe an exemption from complying with the loss mitigation procedures should exist based on separate business practices of a servicer. Further, the Bureau believes that it is preferable that temporary or pilot programs should be addressed through clarifications regarding for which programs, if any, a servicer should evaluate a borrower's application, not by limiting the overall application of the loss mitigation procedures. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(a) has been adjusted to require that servicers comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 without consideration of whether a servicer currently offers loss mitigation options in the ordinary course of business.", 
                        "Second, for the reasons set forth above with respect to \u00a7 1024.30, the scope of \u00a7 1024.41 has been changed to limit the scope of the loss mitigation procedures to a borrower's principal residence. Third, for the reasons set forth above with respect to \u00a7 1024.30, the Bureau has exempted from the loss mitigation procedures requirements (1) small servicers (with the exception of \u00a7 1024.41(j)), (2) reverse mortgage transactions, and (3) \u201cqualified lenders\u201d that are required to comply with Farm Credit Administration regulations relating to distressed borrowers.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau observes that the loss mitigation procedures are issued, among other authorities, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 6 of RESPA. Violations of section 6 of RESPA are subject to a private right of action pursuant to section 6(f) of RESPA. Servicers may be liable to borrowers pursuant to section 6(f) of RESPA for failure to comply with the loss mitigation procedures in \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau believes a private right of action for borrowers to enforce the loss mitigation procedures is necessary to ensure that individual borrowers have the necessary tools to ensure they receive the benefit of the loss mitigation procedures in their own individual circumstances. Further, the Bureau believes that the risk of a private right of action will not negatively impact access to, or cost of, credit. The requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 include clear procedural requirements and have been calibrated to avoid risks of litigation relating to owner or assignee contractual requirements, as discussed below. Further, the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 are consistent with requirements already implemented by the GSEs, the National Mortgage Settlement, and certain State laws, with respect to certain servicers. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised \u00a7 1024.41(a) to reflect the effect of section 6(f) of RESPA with respect to a private right of action.", 
                        "Although servicers are required to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 1024.41, the Bureau has clarified in response to inquiries raised by commenters that servicers are not required by the Bureau's rules to offer any particular loss mitigation option to any particular borrower. Nothing in \u00a7 1024.41 should affect whether a borrower is permitted as a matter of contract law to enforce the terms of any contract or agreement between a servicer and an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Accordingly, the Bureau finalizes \u00a7 1024.41(a) by relocating the substance of proposed comment 41(a)-1 in the text of \u00a7 1024.41(a). Section 1024.41(a) provides that nothing in \u00a7 1024.41 imposes a duty on a servicer to offer any borrower any particular loss mitigation option. Further, \u00a7 1024.41(a) states nothing in \u00a7 1024.41 should be construed to permit a borrower to enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or provision of, any loss mitigation option."

Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1) stated that a complete loss mitigation application means a borrower's submission requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option for which a servicer has received all the information the servicer regularly obtains and considers in evaluating a loss mitigation application by the deadline established by the servicer. Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives an incomplete loss mitigation application to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining information from a borrower to make the application complete. Further, proposed \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives an incomplete loss mitigation application earlier than 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) before the deadline established by the servicer to notify the borrower that the application was incomplete, the documents and information necessary to make the application complete, and the date by which the borrower must submit such documents. The servicer would have been required to provide the notice within 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after receiving an incomplete loss mitigation application.", 
                        "The Bureau received numerous comments regarding these requirements. First, the Bureau received comments regarding the definition of a loss mitigation application and a complete loss mitigation application. A large bank servicer requested clarification regarding prequalification processes, including whether oral communications with borrowers should be considered a loss mitigation application. A non-bank servicer commented that defining a complete loss mitigation application as requiring all the information the servicer \u201cregularly obtains\u201d is both ambiguous and unduly limiting with respect to evaluations of borrowers in substantially different circumstances or subject to substantially different investor requirements. The commenter suggested instead that the Bureau define a complete loss mitigation application as a borrower's submission requesting evaluation for a loss mitigation option for which a servicer has received all the information the servicer obtains and considers in evaluating a loss mitigation application for a particular loan type, investor, or other group of loans, as deemed appropriate by the servicer.", 
                        "Second, the Bureau received comments regarding servicer obligations upon receipt of a loss mitigation application. Specifically, four consumer advocacy groups stated that servicers should be required to review a loss mitigation application for completeness promptly upon receipt. Conversely, a trade association commented that five days is too short a time to evaluate a loss mitigation application, determine that it is incomplete, determine what additional documentation is needed, and generate a notice to the borrower. A financial industry trade association requested that the Bureau provide guidance in the form of examples of \u201creasonable diligence\u201d to obtain information from borrowers. The commenter suggested that one example be that the servicer sends a letter or electronic communication to the borrower with a list of what information is needed and how the borrower can submit that information.", 
                        "Third, a non-bank servicer commented that the Bureau should create standard loss mitigation applications so that industry may align around similar loss mitigation strategies. Finally, a coalition of 60 consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should mandate that servicers provide borrowers that submit incomplete loss mitigation applications a reasonable amount of time to complete the applications.", 
                        "The Bureau has adjusted \u00a7 1024.41(b) in response to the public comments. First, the Bureau agrees with commenters that further clarification regarding the definitions of the term loss mitigation application and complete loss mitigation application is appropriate. Section 1024.31 defines a loss mitigation application to mean an oral or written request for a loss mitigation option that is accompanied by any information required by a servicer for evaluation for a loss mitigation option. This definition is intended to distinguish between inquiries regarding the availability of loss mitigation options and an actual request for an evaluation for a loss mitigation option. The Bureau intends the loss mitigation procedures to apply when servicers receive loss mitigation applications during oral communications with borrowers, including communications between the borrower and any contact personnel assigned to the borrower's mortgage loan account pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40.", 
                        "The definition of a complete loss mitigation application (and, consequently, an incomplete loss mitigation application) has been designed similarly to the complete and incomplete application concepts underlying Regulation B. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 CFR 1002.2(f), 1002.9(c). Thus, at a point in a conversation between a borrower and a mortgage servicer, if the borrower requests an evaluation for a loss mitigation option and provides information to the servicer that will be used in the evaluation of a loss mitigation application, the borrower has made a loss mitigation application, and the servicer, pursuant to &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A), must review the application promptly to determine whether it is complete or incomplete.", 
                        "If a loss mitigation application is complete and has been submitted by an applicable deadline, the servicer must evaluate the loss mitigation application pursuant to the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41. Under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1), a complete loss mitigation application means an application in connection with which a servicer has received all the information that the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower. The Bureau has removed the requirement that a loss mitigation application must include all the information the servicer regularly obtains and considers in evaluating loss mitigation applications. This change is intended to further the goal of providing servicers flexibility to determine the information required for any individual mortgage loan borrower's application for a loss mitigation option and require servicers to consider an application complete notwithstanding that the borrower has not submitted certain information that the servicer may regularly require but is irrelevant with respect to a particular borrower. Thus, under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1), a loss mitigation application is complete when a servicer receives all information that a servicer requires from a borrower.", 
                        "Section 1024.41(b)(1) requires a servicer to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining information to complete a loss mitigation application and to evaluate a complete loss mitigation application. Accordingly, a servicer is required to exercise reasonable diligence to follow up with borrowers to obtain any information the borrower has not submitted that is necessary to make the application complete and to ensure that the servicer timely receives any necessary third-party information, such as an automated valuation or consumer report. Contrary to requests from commenters, the Bureau declines to implement commentary that providing the notice required by \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2) constitutes reasonable diligence for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1). Rather, reasonable diligence is based on the circumstances, including the circumstances of any continuing discussions between a borrower and the contact personnel assigned pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40. Such contact personnel should have information regarding the status of a borrower's loss mitigation application and should work with borrowers to make any such loss mitigation application complete. The Bureau has added commentary to clarify this requirement as set forth below.", 
                        "The Bureau has added commentary to \u00a7 1024.41(b) to clarify the meaning of a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-1 to clarify that a servicer, consistent with the requirements of the investor or assignee with respect to a particular mortgage, has flexibility to establish application requirements for a loss mitigation option offered by an owner or assignee and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from borrowers applying for loss mitigation options. The Bureau agrees with the comments that servicers may require different application information for loss mitigation programs undertaken for different owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Different owners or assignees may establish widely varying criteria and requirements for loss mitigation evaluations, and servicers may require different forms and types of information to effectuate such programs. The Bureau believes the requirement that a complete loss mitigation application contain information required by servicers provides appropriate flexibility to servicers to determine application requirements consistent with the variety of borrower circumstances or owner or assignee requirements that servicers must evaluate and to ensure that individual borrowers are not obliged to provide information or documents that are unnecessary and inappropriate for a loss mitigation evaluation.", 
                        "The Bureau has added comments 41(b)(1)-2 and 41(b)(1)-3 in response to comments requesting clarity regarding prequalification programs and other feedback seeking clarification regarding informal communications between servicers and borrowers. As set forth above, the Bureau received a comment from a large bank servicer requesting clarification regarding prequalification programs. Further, in outreach, another large bank servicer requested clarification regarding whether the Bureau's regulations, and specifically, the error resolution and the loss mitigation procedures represented a policy of regulation of informal communication.", 
                        "Although the Bureau has withdrawn the proposed requirements regarding oral error resolution and information request process with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35-1024.36, the Bureau believes that the loss mitigation procedures should apply when a borrower orally requests evaluation for a loss mitigation option. One of the principal goals of the early intervention and continuity of contact requirements of the rule is to establish oral communications between servicers and borrowers; it would be inconsistent with that purpose to ignore these communications in determining whether a borrower has requested consideration for a loss mitigation option. Further, one of the purposes of the loss mitigation procedures is to provide accurate information to borrowers and to facilitate the evaluation of foreclosure avoidance options by creating uniform evaluation processes and ensuring that a borrower obtains an evaluation for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower. That purpose may be circumvented if the loss mitigation requirements focused only on written communications, and a servicer could steer a borrower into a specific loss mitigation option through oral communications. Consistent with the requirements set forth in Regulation B regarding applications for credit, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of RESPA to implement requirements on servicers to treat oral communications that have sufficiently passed the point of inquiries as loss mitigation applications subject to the loss mitigation procedures.", 
                        "The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-2 to clarify when an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application. The Bureau recognizes there is substantial ambiguity in interpersonal communications but believes that loss mitigation applications should be considered expansively. For example, if a borrower indicates that the borrower would like to apply for a loss mitigation option and provides any information the servicer would evaluate in connection with a loss mitigation application, a borrower has submitted a loss mitigation application. Because a servicer must exercise reasonable diligence in making a loss mitigation application complete, the Bureau believes appropriate communication with a borrower that expresses an interest in a loss mitigation option is to clarify the borrower's intention regarding the submission and to obtain information from the borrower to make a loss mitigation application complete.", 
                        "Not all communications regarding loss mitigation options will constitute loss mitigation applications. Accordingly, the Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-3 to illustrate circumstances where oral communications will not constitute a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(b)(1)-3.i states that a borrower calls to ask about loss mitigation options and servicer personnel explain the loss mitigation options available to the borrower and the criteria for determining the borrower's eligibility for any such loss mitigation option. In this example, only an inquiry has taken place. The borrower has not submitted information that would be evaluated in connection with a loss mitigation option. Comment 41(b)(1)-3.ii states that a borrower calls to ask about the process for applying for a loss mitigation option but the borrower does not provide any information that a servicer would consider for evaluating a loss mitigation application. A servicer that provides information regarding the process for applying for a loss mitigation application has not taken a loss mitigation application in this circumstance.", 
                        "The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-4 to indicate how a servicer should comply with its requirement to undertake reasonable diligence to obtain the information necessary to make an incomplete loss mitigation application complete. For example, a servicer must request information necessary to make a loss mitigation application complete promptly after receiving the loss mitigation application. Comment 41(b)(1)-4.i provides that reasonable diligence requires contacting an applicant promptly to obtain information missing from a loss mitigation application, like an address or telephone number to verify employment. This obligation exists notwithstanding a servicer's obligation to provide a notice pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B). Further, comment 41(b)(1)-4.ii provides that reasonable diligence also includes reviewing documents that may have been included in connection with a servicing transfer to determine if a borrower previously submitted information or documents to a transferor servicer that may complete a loss mitigation application.", 
                        "The Bureau has added comment 41(b)(1)-5 regarding circumstances where a servicer requires information that is not in the borrower's control. A loss mitigation application is complete when a borrower provides all information required from the borrower notwithstanding that additional information may be required by a servicer that is not in the control of a borrower. For example, if a servicer requires a consumer report for a loss mitigation evaluation, a loss mitigation application is considered complete if a borrower has submitted all information required from the borrower without regard to whether a servicer has obtained a consumer report that a servicer has requested from a consumer reporting agency.", 
                        "The Bureau has also adjusted the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2) with respect to a servicer's obligation upon receipt of a loss mitigation application. The Bureau agrees with the comments it received that a servicer should be required to promptly evaluate a loss mitigation application to determine whether the application is complete or incomplete. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A) requires a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application to determine promptly upon receipt whether such application is complete or incomplete. Further, under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), a servicer must notify a borrower in 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) regarding whether the servicer has determined an application is complete or incomplete.", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2) would have required a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application to provide a notice to a borrower only in the event a loss mitigation application is incomplete. The Bureau recognizes, however, that a borrower that submits a complete loss mitigation application may not realize that such application has been considered complete and that an evaluation for a loss mitigation application is ongoing. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) requires providing a notice to a borrower regardless of whether the application is complete or incomplete.", 
                        "Section 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) further requires a servicer that determines a loss mitigation application is incomplete to notify the borrower of the additional documents and information the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete and the date by which the borrower must submit the additional documents and information to be reviewed. The notice to the borrower must also include a statement that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options. The Bureau has added this statement to the notice in connection with withdrawing proposed \u00a7 1024.41(j), discussed below, with respect to providing a loss mitigation application to servicers of other mortgage loan liens. Further, because of the added content of the notice and the requirements with respect to oral communications constituting loss mitigation applications, the Bureau has determined to withdraw the proposal that the notice required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) could be provided orally. Rather, the Bureau has determined the notice must be provided in writing.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau finds that 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) is a reasonable amount of time for a servicer to comply with the requirements for an incomplete loss mitigation application. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, as well as the National Mortgage Settlement, require servicers to provide a substantially similar but, in some cases, more prescriptive, notice within 5 business days of receipt of an incomplete loss mitigation application.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau has added \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) to clarify how a servicer communicates to a borrower the deadline by which the borrower should submit a complete loss mitigation application. A servicer must state to the borrower that the borrower should submit documents needed to complete the application by the earliest remaining date of four potential options. The rule provides that a servicer must disclose the date a borrower should complete a loss mitigation application, rather than the date a borrower must complete a loss mitigation application, because the effect of the various timelines is that a borrower may miss the deadline communicated by the servicer but still be able to submit a complete loss mitigation application in the future (and thus a requirement that a borrower must complete an application by an earlier deadline may be inaccurate). However, a borrower should complete the application by the applicable deadline in order to incur the lowest application burden and to gain the benefit of the most consumer protections for the loss mitigation application. Further, the Bureau agrees with comments received from a number of servicers and their trade associations that it is appropriate to encourage earlier submission of loss mitigation applications by borrowers.", 
                        "A servicer must state that the borrower should provide the documents and information by the earliest remaining date of: (a) The date by which any document or information already submitted by a borrower will be considered stale or invalid pursuant to any requirements applicable to any loss mitigation program available to the borrower; (b) the date that is the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency; (c) the date that is 90 days before a foreclosure sale; or (d) the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale. Dates in (b), (c), and (d) are designed to match the various scenarios set forth above with respect to the timing of the loss mitigation procedures. The date in (a) is meant to incorporate any internal servicer policy to ensure that borrowers do not submit documents beyond the date when documents and information previously provided are considered stale or invalid, which would frustrate the process of obtaining a complete loss mitigation application."

                                "The Bureau agrees with commenters that owners and assignees of mortgage loans should have latitude to establish appropriate loss mitigation programs and the eligibility criteria for such programs. For example, if a servicer services mortgage loans for itself and for the GSEs, a servicer is only required to review a borrower whose mortgage loan is guaranteed by the GSEs for programs approved by the GSEs, pursuant to criteria established by the GSEs. The servicer is not required to review the GSE borrower for loss mitigation options the servicer implements for mortgage loans owned by the servicer or another investor, because such loss mitigation options are not available to the borrower and any such evaluation is unnecessary and futile. Further, the applicable owner or assignee has latitude to set forth any evaluation criteria the owner or assignee deems appropriate. If a loss mitigation option is only available for military servicemembers, a servicer has conducted a proper evaluation if it determines that the borrower is not a servicemember and, therefore, does not meet the eligibility criteria for the program. Similarly, to the extent eligibility criteria for pilot programs, temporary programs, or programs that are limited by the number of participating borrowers, would exclude a borrower from eligibility, a servicer is not obligated to evaluate the borrower for any such loss mitigation option as if such eligibility criteria did not exist. The owner or assignee of a mortgage loan has the freedom to establish or authorize any programs it deems appropriate and to establish or authorize the eligibility criteria for such programs that the owner or assignee deems appropriate; a servicer is only obligated to provide the borrower a notice stating the results of the servicer's review of the borrower's complete loss mitigation application for the programs established or authorized by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. To this end, the Bureau has clarified in \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1) that a servicer is required to evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Use of a &#8220;waterfall&#8221; as an eligibility criterion.</em> The Bureau believes the requirements in &#167; 1024.41(c)(1) to evaluate a loss mitigation application for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower is not inconsistent with a determination by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan to evaluate a borrower for loss mitigation options by using a &#8220;waterfall&#8221; method. A waterfall is simply an evaluation rule. For example, an owner or assignee may provide six loss mitigation programs for which borrowers should be evaluated. The owner or assignee may further provide that the programs should be evaluated in order from one through six and that if a borrower is offered a program evaluated higher in the order, the borrower will be denied for all other programs lower in the order. Thus, in this example, if a borrower were offered program two, the borrower would necessarily be denied for programs three through six as a consequence of the owner's or assignee's requirements. Nothing in the loss mitigation procedures dictates a result different than that obtained using a waterfall.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Evaluation for all loss mitigation options.</em> The requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, in combination with the notice requirements of &#167; 1024.41(d)(1), is intended to enable a borrower (1) to understand the loss mitigation options for which the servicer has determined the borrower is eligible, (2) to understand the results of the servicer's evaluation of the borrower for any loan modification option, and (3) for any loan modification option, to obtain the reasons for the borrower's denial for a loan modification option. The impact of the requirement that a borrower receive an evaluation for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower is that the borrower may, by submitting a single application, receive a complete review and either obtain a loss mitigation option that a borrower may or may not have known was available or, pursuant to &#167; 1024.41(d)(1), understand the reasons why the borrower is not eligible for a loan modification option. The Bureau does not believe that the requirements in &#167; 1024.41(c)(1) will impair an investor's or guarantor's ability to implement or manage loss mitigation programs.", 
                                "The Bureau also does not believe that the requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower will impose onerous application burdens on a borrower, require a servicer to provide confusing or unhelpful communications to borrowers, or frustrate borrowers that, in theory, may only wish to obtain an evaluation for a specific type of loss mitigation option. Loss mitigation options generally fall into two categories, those involving home retention (most notably loan modifications) and non-home retention options. Insofar as commenters are suggesting that different retention options carry with them different application requirements and that servicers should be free to consider borrowers sequentially for different options through separate application processes, the Bureau disagrees. With respect to home retention options, outreach with consumer advocates and industry participants has not indicated that there are significant differences in the information required for consideration for differing retention options offered by a single investor or assignee such that requiring consideration for all of these options at once will add burden to the consumer or servicer. Importantly, the National Mortgage Settlement states that \u201c[u]pon timely receipt of a complete loan modification application, Servicer shall evaluate borrowers for all available loan modification options for which they are eligible * * * .\u201d\n            \n          ", 
                                "Although it is true, as a large bank commenter stated, that the Bureau's requirements apply to all loss mitigation options and not just loan modification options, the Bureau does not believe that this additional requirement will add significant burden to consumers or servicers. The Bureau understands from outreach with servicers that most investors or guarantors do not permit a borrower to be evaluated for a non-home retention option (i.e., to walk away from a mortgage) unless a home retention option is not viable. Thus, in all events borrowers will be required to submit the financial and other information required for consideration of retention options and servicers will be required to obtain additional information about the borrower (such as a consumer report) and the property (such as an automated valuation). The Bureau is not persuaded that significant additional burdens are required to be able to consider a borrower for non-home retention options if the borrower is found not to be eligible for home retention options.", 
                                "The Bureau understands that industry commenters and trade associations are concerned that evaluation for non-home retention options may cause servicers to incur additional work and cost, including by obtaining a title search or an appraisal. The Bureau has added comment 41(c)(1)-3 to clarify that an offer of a non-home retention option may be conditional upon receipt of further information not in the borrower's possession and necessary to establish the parameters of a servicer's offer. For example, a servicer complies with the requirement for evaluating the borrower for a short sale option if the servicer offers the borrower the opportunity to enter into a listing or marketing period agreement but indicates that specifics of an acceptable short sale transaction may be subject to further information obtained from an appraisal or title search.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that significant consumer benefits will result from requiring that consumers be considered for all loss mitigation options in a single process. The Bureau understands that borrowers may incur more significant burdens in the current market as evaluations occur sequentially over time and borrower documents and information must be continuously updated to make such documents and information current. The requirements of \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1) will eliminate the need for borrowers to submit multiple applications for different loss mitigation options and will provide for more efficient compliance by servicers with the requirements of the rule. In addition, as set forth below with respect to \u00a7 1024.41(d), the Bureau believes providing information to borrowers on the result of their review for available loss mitigation options will assist consumers and is unlikely to create confusion.", 
                                "Further, the Bureau believes that a process that imposes the obligation on the borrower to identify the appropriate loss mitigation option is inappropriate. The selection of a loss mitigation option is complex and requires an understanding of the potential eligibility of a borrower when compared against the complex rule systems applied to evaluate such options. The differences among loss mitigation programs befuddle industry experts, much less borrowers attempting to evaluate such options while under the fear of foreclosure. The Bureau simply does not believe that permitting servicers to steer borrowers to apply for particular loss mitigation options, when the servicer has a far superior capacity to make the relevant determination, reasonably protects the borrower's interest. Rather, the Bureau believes a more reasonable default is for the party with the knowledge of all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, and the capability of evaluating the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, to carry the burden of evaluating the borrower for all loss mitigation options available from the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and to communicate the results of that review to the borrower. If the borrower is found to be eligible for more than one option, the borrower can then make a more informed choice of the options available <em data-original=\"E-03\">after</em> the evaluation has occurred, not before; if the borrower is found to be eligible for only one option (as would likely be the case where the owner or assignee follows a waterfall) the borrower will at least receive information indicating why the borrower is being offered a particular option and not others and will, in certain circumstances, be able to seek further review from the servicer if the borrower believes that the waterfall has been misapplied.", 
                                "In addition, review for non-home retention options may provide a valuable sorting function to the short sale market. Currently, a borrower who has been denied a loan modification and who is attempting to complete a short sale may proceed with little guidance from a servicer regarding whether the borrower will be eligible for a short sale. A short sale involves identifying a potential purchaser and working to obtain funding and a transaction that may be acceptable to an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan even before a determination regarding whether an owner or assignee would potentially consider a short sale. By requiring an evaluation for non-home retention options simultaneously with the evaluation for home retention options, the Bureau creates a process by which a borrower that is denied a home retention option will be told whether the borrower is eligible for a non-home retention option, such as a short sale. Borrowers who are told that they are eligible for a short sale may better undertake the effort necessary to reach a viable sale, and may make the market for short sale transactions more efficient by obtaining servicer agreement to consider a short sale transaction. Further, concurrent evaluation reduces the risk that borrowers do not pursue options that may be available as a result of exhaustion with the loss mitigation process.", 
                                "The Bureau has added commentary to \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1) to clarify a servicer's obligation to evaluate a complete loss mitigation application for all loss mitigation options available from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. Comment 41(c)(1)-1 states that the conduct of a servicer's evaluation with respect to any loss mitigation option is in the discretion of the servicer. A servicer meets the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1)(i) if the servicer makes a determination regarding the borrower's eligibility for a loss mitigation program. Consistent with \u00a7 1024.41(a), because nothing in section 1024.41 should be construed to resolve whether borrower can enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or provision of, any loss mitigation option, \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1) does not require that an evaluation meet any standard other than the discretion of the servicer. Accordingly, the Bureau intends that the requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available from an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan sets forth the procedure that must be followed by servicers but does not create, in itself, a requirement that a servicer conduct such evaluation in any particular manner. Accordingly, the Bureau does not intend to create a private right of action to enforce the guidelines of any owner or assignee's loss mitigation program, including any HAMP requirements or GSE requirements, as a consequence of this requirement. Servicers should take note, however, that, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38, above, and independent of the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41, a servicer may be required to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of properly evaluating borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.", 
                                "Comment 41(c)(1)-2 states that a servicer should evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options for which a borrower may qualify based upon eligibility criteria applicable to each loss mitigation option, as established by the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, a servicer services mortgage loans for two different investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Those investors or guarantors each have different loss mitigation programs. A servicer is only required to evaluate the borrower for loss mitigation options offered by the owner or assignee of a borrower's mortgage loan and is not required to evaluate a borrower for any other program implemented by a mortgage servicer for an owner or assignee that is different than the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Further, if a servicer services mortgage loans for an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan that has established pilot programs, temporary programs, or programs that are limited by the number of participating borrowers, a servicer is only required to evaluate whether a borrower is eligible for any such program consistent with criteria established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, if an owner or assignee has limited a pilot program to a certain geographic area or to a limited number of participants, a servicer should evaluate the borrower in accordance with any such restrictions, which may include an owner or assignee's determination not to include the borrower in the pilot program or among the group of participants applying for a limited option."

As set forth above, the definition of a loss mitigation application is expansive. When a borrower begins the process by submitting a loss mitigation application, a servicer should be required to work with that borrower to make the loss mitigation application complete, and thereby assure the borrower receives the protections set forth in \u00a7 1024.41. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(i) states that a servicer shall not evade the requirement to evaluate a complete loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower, including, for example, by offering an individual loss mitigation option based upon an evaluation of borrower's incomplete loss mitigation application.", 
                                "Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1 clarifies that \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(i) does not prohibit a servicer from offering a loss mitigation option to a borrower that has not submitted a loss mitigation application. Further, a servicer may offer a borrower that has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application a loss mitigation option, but only if the offer of the loss mitigation option is not based on an evaluation of the individual borrower's circumstances. Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1 provides, for example, that if a servicer offers trial loan modification programs to all borrowers that become 150 days delinquent without an application or consideration of any information provided by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application, the servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of section 1024.41 with respect to any such trial loan modification program for any borrower that has not submitted a loss mitigation application or that has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application. The example complies with \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2) because the offer of the loss mitigation option is based on a standard practice and not on an evaluation of any information or documents submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(c)(2)(i)-2 clarifies that although a review of a borrower's incomplete loss mitigation application is within a servicer's discretion, and is not required by \u00a7 1024.41, a servicer may be required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v), to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Such evaluation may be subject to requirements applicable to loss mitigation applications otherwise considered incomplete pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41.", 
                                "The Bureau recognizes that some borrowers may submit incomplete loss mitigation applications and may not submit the documents or information necessary to make those applications complete. The Bureau believes that the best approach for servicers to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 is to work with borrowers to make incomplete loss mitigation applications complete and servicers have an obligation to undertake reasonable diligence in this regard. However, where such diligence has failed, the loss mitigation procedures should not serve as an impediment to working with borrowers that are not able to complete the loss mitigation application requirements. Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(ii) provides that notwithstanding \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(i), if a servicer has exercised reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application, but a loss mitigation application remains incomplete for a significant period of time under the circumstances without further progress by a borrower to make the loss mitigation application complete, a servicer may, in its discretion, evaluate an incomplete loss mitigation application and determine to offer a borrower a loss mitigation option. Any such evaluation and offer is not subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 and shall not constitute an evaluation of a single complete loss mitigation application for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41(i). The Bureau has further added comment 41(c)(2)(ii) to clarify the meaning of a significant period of time under the circumstances. Any such circumstances may include consideration of the relative timing of the foreclosure process. Thus, a delay of 10 or 15 days in providing documents or information to make a loss mitigation complete may be more significant if the period is close to a potential foreclosure sale than such period would be if it were to occur early in the foreclosure process, including, for example, in the time period that is less than 120 days of delinquency."

Requiring that a borrower select a loss mitigation option for which the borrower may be considered, or only evaluating a borrower for a few loss mitigation options, may cause a borrower to accept or reject an option without seeking evaluation for another option. This may lead to less effective programs, disparate outcomes for similarly situated borrowers, and longer timelines for effectuating loss mitigation options. Instead, the Bureau has proposed that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation programs available to the borrower. The Bureau believes that this approach will ensure that all borrowers receive fair evaluations for all options available to them and will be able to select options appropriate for their circumstances. In sum, owners or assignees of mortgage loans (including investors, guarantors, and insurers that establish criteria governing loss mitigation programs) retain the ability to manage loss mitigation programs to ensure that borrower eligibility and program administration is consistent with their requirements, while borrowers will be able to understand all potential options that may be available.", 
                        "Consumer advocate commenters supported the proposed requirement that a servicer evaluate a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower within 30 days. For example, one such commenter stated that the rule as proposed would add more transparency in the loss mitigation process, would enable borrowers to make a more informed decision on their loss mitigation options, and would actually reduce paperwork burdens on borrowers by eliminating the necessity of a borrower having to send duplicate and additional paperwork each time a borrower requested consideration for a different loss mitigation option.", 
                        "Conversely, industry commenters, including numerous large banks, credit unions, community banks, non-bank servicers, and their trade associations, generally opposed the requirement that a servicer review a borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower within 30 days. These commenters generally believed that servicers should be permitted to follow investor waterfalls for foreclosure prevention options. These commenters stated that the volume of documents borrowers may be required to submit to effectuate a review of all loss mitigation options may be substantial. Further, industry commenters stated that the rule as proposed would require overly complicated and unclear communications with customers and those customers should be entitled to a communication only about the option for which they specifically applied.", 
                        "Commenters requested that the Bureau permit servicers to allow borrowers to choose between home retention and non-home retention options for evaluations. For example, a Federal agency stated that servicers should be able to separate borrowers for evaluation purposes based upon whether a hardship is temporary or permanent and, accordingly, whether a home retention or non-home retention option is appropriate. A law firm commented that servicers should be able to apply different evaluations for borrowers that indicate a preference for a home retention or non-home retention option. A small credit union and three community bank commenters stated that loss mitigation should be a flexible process and prescriptive requirements that servicers review for all options may reduce optionality in favor of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d process. Further, a credit union trade association stated that requiring credit unions to review for all loss mitigation options would be overly burdensome. One trade association requested that the requirement that a servicer be required to review for all loss mitigation options should be withdrawn because it is not required by the Dodd-Frank Act and because providing a notice of all options will result in appeals from borrowers seeking more attractive workout options.\n            Finally, a large bank servicer and a Federal agency requested clarification that a servicer is not required to provide borrowers with information about modifications that are not available to the borrower.", 
                        "For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1024.41(c) as proposed with minor modifications. Further, the Bureau is adopting the commentary to \u00a7 1024.41(c) with minor modifications. The requirements of proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c) are located within \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1). The Bureau has also added \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2) to implement requirements for offering loss mitigation options to borrowers that have not completed loss mitigation applications, which are discussed below."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(d) would have required that servicers comply with additional obligations with respect to a denial of a borrower's loss mitigation application with respect to trial or permanent loan modification options. A servicer would have been required to provide any such borrower a written notice stating the specific reasons for the determination and inform the borrower of the right to appeal the servicer's determination pursuant to proposed \u00a7 1024.41(h). The notice would have included the deadline for filing the appeal and any requirements for pursuing the appeal, such as, for example, forms or documents the borrower must file in connection with the appeal process. Further, proposed comments 41(d)(1)-1 and 41(d)(1)-2 would have provided examples regarding the information that should be included in the specific reasons provided to the borrower in the notice when a borrower is denied a loan modification on the basis of an investor requirement or a net present value calculation. The Bureau stated that it believed such information would assist borrowers in providing appropriate and relevant information to servicers in connection with the appeal process. Further, such requirements were consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Consumers and consumer advocacy group commenters generally supported the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41(d). One such commenter stated that the requirement would further the goal of protecting consumers against discriminatory servicing practices because the required notice would likely discourage those practices. A consumer advocacy group commented that the notification requirement should be expanded to all loss mitigation programs beyond loan modifications and a coalition of consumer advocacy groups commented that servicers should be required to provide specific information and documents about the investor denial to borrowers. Consumer commenters on Regulation Room were concerned that servicers misrepresented that investor requirements barred a loan modification when no such restriction existed and sought fuller disclosure in that regard.", 
                        "Industry commenters submitted various requests for clarification regarding \u00a7 1024.41(d). Two credit unions and their trade associations, as well as a consumer advocacy group, requested clarification regarding the impact of the required notification regarding a denial of a loan modification option with the adverse action notice required by Regulation B when a consumer report is used in connection with a denial for a loan modification option. Further, the GSEs requested clarification regarding whether the offer of an alternative loss mitigation option (such as a forbearance or repayment plan) constitutes a denial of a loss mitigation option. Finally, a financial industry trade association requested clarification regarding whether servicers could use the \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d model clauses adopted by the Making Home Affordable Program to communicate with borrowers regarding denials of loss mitigation options pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(d).", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1024.41(d) as proposed, with technical changes to clarify that the requirement applies to complete loss mitigation applications and that loan modification options refers to programs offered by the applicable owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. In light of the comments, the Bureau believes that adjustments to the commentary are warranted. The Bureau is adjusting comments 41(d)(1)-1 and 41(d)(1)-2 as set forth below, and adding comments 41(d)(1)-3 and 41(d)(1)-4.", 
                        "Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(d), a servicer that denies a borrower's complete loss mitigation application for any trial or permanent loan modification option available from the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan shall state in the notice provided to the borrower pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) the specific reasons for the servicer's determination for each such trial or permanent loan modification program; and, if applicable, that the borrower may appeal the servicer's determination for any such trial or permanent loan modification option, the deadline for the borrower to make an appeal, and any requirements for making an appeal. Importantly, \u00a7 1024.41(d) provides special rules for those loss mitigation options that involve loan modifications. With respect to those options, the servicer is required to provide the borrower with the specific reasons for denying the borrower for each trial or permanent modification for which the borrower was considered and, if applicable, notice of the borrower's right to appeal. However, under \u00a7 1024.41(d), a servicer is not required to disclose to a borrower a denial for a loss mitigation option that is not a loan modification program (for non-loan modification options, such denial is implicit in the servicer's failure to offer such a loss mitigation option).", 
                        "With respect to identifying the reasons for a servicer's denial of a borrower for a loan modification option, the Bureau recognizes the consumer frustration resulting from servicer statements that investor requirements or net present value tests bar a loan modification option when the proper application of such purported requirements or tests may or may not actually result in such a determination. To assist consumer understanding, and to effectuate the appeal process, the Bureau believes that servicers that deny a loan modification option on the basis of an investor requirement or net present value model must provide additional detail to support such statements. Accordingly, the Bureau has adjusted comment 41(d)(1)-1 to state that if a trial or permanent loan modification option is denied because of a requirement of an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the requirement that is the basis of the denial. A statement that the denial of a loan modification option is based on an investor requirement, without additional information specifically identifying the relevant investor or guarantor and the specific applicable requirement, is insufficient. However, where an investor or guarantor has established a waterfall and a borrower has qualified for a particular option on the waterfall, it is sufficient for the servicer to inform the borrower, with respect to other options further down the waterfall that the investor's requirements include the use of a waterfall and that a determination to offer an option on the waterfall necessarily results in a denial for any other options below the option for which the borrower has qualified, to the extent applicable for any such option.", 
                        "Further, the Bureau has adjusted comment 41(d)(1)-2 to provide that if a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must include all the inputs used in the net present value calculation, rather than just the limited inputs identified in the proposed commentary.", 
                        "The Bureau has also added comments to address the form of the notice required by \u00a7 1024.41(d). No specific format is required for the notice provided pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(d). Accordingly, servicers may determine the appropriate form, so long as the form includes the content required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(d). Comment 41(d)(1)-3 clarifies that a servicer may combine other notices required by applicable law, including, without limitation, a notice with respect to an adverse action, as required by Regulation B (12 CFR 1002 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>), or a notice required pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with the notice required pursuant to section 1024.41(d), unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.", 
                        "Further, servicers may develop standard language and forms that are appropriate to comply with this section. The Making Home Affordable Program has promulgated model clauses that servicers operating pursuant to that program may use in communications with borrowers regarding denials of applicable loan modification options. Those clauses are set forth in Appendix A to the Making Home Affordable Program Handbook.\n            Without endorsing the use of those model clauses in any instance, the model clauses adopted by the Making Home Affordable Program may be appropriate for use in specific circumstances.\n            A servicer is responsible for monitoring whether the use of the model clauses is accurate and appropriate for any individual borrower.", 
                        "Finally, comment 41(d)(1)-4 clarifies that any determination not to offer a loan modification option, notwithstanding whether a servicer offers a borrower a different loan modification option or other loss mitigation option, constitutes a denial of a loan modification option. Thus, if a servicer offers a borrower a forbearance option or repayment plan after evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application, any such offer, without an offer of a loan modification option, constitutes a denial for a loan modification option and a servicer shall provide the disclosures required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(d) with respect to any loan modification program available to the borrower. Again, to the extent a waterfall was the basis for the determination, the disclosure may state, for example, that the investor's requirement do not permit a borrower to receive a loan modification offer if a determination is made that the borrower has the capacity to repay the mortgage with forbearance or repayment, along with an explanation of the reasons for the conclusion that the borrower can do so with a forbearance plan."

The proposed rule would have provided that a borrower must have no less than 14 days to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option. Further, the proposed rule would have clarified that if a servicer has not received a response from a borrower to an offer of loss mitigation after 14 days, the servicer may deem the borrower's lack of a response as a rejection of the loss mitigation option. A 14-day timeframe for a borrower to respond to an offer of a loss mitigation option is consistent with GSE requirements, the National Mortgage Settlement, certain State laws, and Federal regulatory agency requirements.\n            The proposed rule also would have provided that if a borrower does not satisfy the servicer's requirements for accepting a loss mitigation option, but submits the first payment that would be owed pursuant to any such loss mitigation option within the deadline established by the servicer, the borrower was to be deemed to have accepted the offer of a loss mitigation option. This presumption was intended to maintain consistency with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement.",

Two financial industry trade associations and a community bank indicated that compliance with the statute of frauds, as well as investor contracts, requires written acceptance of a loss mitigation option, and the lack of a written agreement would create unjustified risks for servicers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans. A non-bank servicer stated that allowing acceptance by payment would only work for trial loan modification plans, and then only if subject to future documentation. The commenter stated that written agreements must be required for permanent loan modifications, short sales, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreements, and longer term repayment plans.",

As discussed above, the 14 day timeline requirement is consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement and certain State law requirements. Further, the secondary 7-day timeline is designed to implement appropriate procedures for timing scenario 3, discussed above.

If an appeal is denied, the borrower will have 14 days to determine whether to accept an offer for another loss mitigation option previously offered pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(c)(1)(ii).

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(f) would have required servicers to comply with the loss mitigation procedures by reviewing complete and timely loss mitigation applications before a servicer could proceed with a foreclosure sale. Timely applications included complete loss mitigation applications submitted within a deadline established by a servicers, which could be no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale. By prohibiting servicers from proceeding to a foreclosure sale while a complete and timely loss mitigation application is pending, the proposed rule would have addressed one of the most direct consumer harms relating to concurrent evaluation of loss mitigation options and prosecution of foreclosure proceedings. The proposed rule also would have prohibited a servicer from moving forward with a foreclosure sale while the borrower was performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "As discussed above, the Bureau received a significant number of comments from consumer advocacy groups regarding dual tracking of evaluation of loss mitigation options and foreclosure processing. These comments generally stated that borrowers should have the opportunity to be reviewed for a loss mitigation option before a servicer begins a foreclosure process. Further, consumer advocates submitted a significant number of comments stating that although the Bureau's proposal would address harms resulting from a foreclosure sale, other harms to consumers relating to dual tracking were not addressed by the proposed rule. These included consumer harms resulting from participating in the foreclosure process, including confusion from receiving inconsistent and confusing foreclosure communications while loss mitigation reviews are on-going. Such confusion potentially may lead to failures by borrowers to complete loss mitigation processes, or impede borrowers' ability to identify errors committed by servicers reviewing applications for loss mitigation options that may have more beneficial consequences for borrowers as well as owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Further, borrowers may be negatively impacted because borrowers are responsible for accruing potentially unnecessary foreclosure costs while an application for a loss mitigation option is under review. These costs burden already struggling borrowers and may impact the evaluation for a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "As stated above, consumer advocacy group commenters recommended that the Bureau restrict servicers from pursuing the foreclosure process as well as evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation on dual tracks. Twelve individual consumer advocacy groups as well as two coalitions of consumer advocacy groups stated that the Bureau should require servicers to undertake loss mitigation evaluations, including loan modification reviews and offers, prior to beginning the foreclosure process. Further, three consumer advocacy groups commented that the Bureau should create a defined pre-foreclosure period of 120 days before a borrower can be referred to foreclosure, and that servicers should perform a mandatory review of a borrower for loss mitigation options during this period.\n          ", 
                        "Industry commenters also addressed whether the Bureau should implement protections relating to dual tracking apart from the prohibition on foreclosure sale set forth in the proposal. Outreach with servicers and their trade associations, indicated general support for maintaining consistency among any \u201cdual tracking\u201d requirements established by the Bureau and the National Mortgage Settlement. A law firm commented that Bureau requirements with respect to \u201cdual tracking\u201d should model the National Mortgage Settlement. Notably, a community bank and its trade association commented that as a consequence of the Bureau's regulations on loss mitigation procedures, servicers may try to begin foreclosures as soon as possible after delinquency in order to preserve flexibility to comply with the loss mitigation procedures.", 
                        "As discussed more fully in the opening of the discussion of \u00a7 1024.41, the Bureau is persuaded by the comments that the potential harm to consumers of commencing a foreclosure proceeding before the consumer has had a reasonable opportunity to submit a loss mitigation application or while a complete loss mitigation application is pending is substantial. The fact that the GSEs and the National Mortgage Settlement defer commencing foreclosure proceedings until a borrower has had a reasonable opportunity to apply for a loss mitigation option is further persuasive that such a restriction on the commencement of foreclosure proceedings would further the consumer protection purposes of RESPA and would not present a significant risk of unintended consequences.", 
                        "The Bureau further believes it is necessary and appropriate for borrowers, servicers, and courts to have a known early period during which a servicer shall not begin the foreclosure process. The Bureau also believes that a servicer should not be permitted to begin the foreclosure process when there is a pending complete loss mitigation application and believes that such a requirement, unless coupled with a restriction on when the foreclosure process can begin, might incentivize servicers to begin the foreclosure process earlier than would otherwise occur to avoid delay resulting from the submission of a complete loss mitigation application. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is necessary and appropriate to implement the consumer protection purposes of RESPA by barring servicers from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process if a borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application before any such filing. The Bureau further believes it is necessary and appropriate to implement the consumer protection purposes of RESPA to bar servicers from making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process if a borrower is not more than 120 days delinquent in order to provide the borrower sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau understands and intends that any such requirement will preempt State laws to the extent such laws permit filing of foreclosure actions earlier than after the 120th day of delinquency.", 
                        "Accordingly, \u00a7 1024.41(f) implements these prohibitions. First, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1), a servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless a borrower's mortgage loan obligation is greater than 120 days delinquent. Second, pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(f)(2), if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application during the pre-foreclosure review period set forth in paragraph (f)(1) or before a servicer has made the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, a servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless the borrower is not eligible for any loss mitigation option (and any appeal is inapplicable or has been exhausted), has rejected all offers of loss mitigation options, or has failed to comply with the terms of an agreement on a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "The Bureau has also added comment 41(f)(1)-1 to clarify the prohibition on making the first notice or filing required by applicable law. Per comment 41(f)(1)-1, the first notice or filing required by applicable law refers to any document required to be filed with a court, entered into a land record, or provided to a borrower as a requirement for proceeding with a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process. Such filings include, for example, a foreclosure complaint, a notice of default, a notice of election and demand, or any other notice that is required by applicable law in order to pursue acceleration of a mortgage loan obligation or sale of a property securing a mortgage loan obligation."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(g) would have required that if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application by a deadline established by a servicer that was no earlier than 90 days before a foreclosure sale, the servicer may not proceed to foreclosure sale unless: (1) The servicer denies the borrower's application for a loss mitigation option and the appeal process is inapplicable, the borrower has not requested an appeal, or the time for requesting an appeal has expired; (2) the servicer denies the borrower's appeal; (3) the borrower rejects a servicer's offer of a loss mitigation option; or (4) a borrower fails to perform pursuant to the terms of a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "The Bureau stated that it is appropriate to require that if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application by the deadline established by the servicer, a servicer should not proceed with a foreclosure sale until the servicer and borrower have terminated discussions regarding loss mitigation options. Further, the Bureau stated that it is appropriate to suspend a foreclosure sale when a borrower is performing under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. A servicer's basis for servicing a mortgage loan, and undertaking actions to collect on an unpaid obligation, emanates from the contractual relationship between the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the borrower. A servicer's determination to hold a foreclosure sale when a borrower is performing under an agreement that forestalls foreclosure violates the agreement entered into with the borrower. Additionally, it is already standard industry practice for a servicer to suspend a foreclosure sale during any period where a borrower is making payments pursuant to the terms of a trial loan modification. The Bureau stated in the proposal that prohibiting a servicer from proceeding with a foreclosure sale until termination of the loss mitigation discussion will eliminate the clearest harms to borrowers resulting from servicers' pursuit of loss mitigation and foreclosure proceedings concurrently.", 
                        "Proposed comments 41(g)(4)-1 and 41(g)(4)-2 would have clarified the application of the borrower performance definitions with respect to short sales. As stated in the proposal, a short sale typically will include a listing or marketing period during which a servicer will agree to postpone a foreclosure sale in order to allow a borrower to market a property for a short sale transaction. The proposed comments stated that a borrower is considered to be performing under the terms of a short sale agreement, or other similar loss mitigation agreement, during the term of any such marketing or listing period, and any time subsequent to such periods, if a short sale transaction is approved by all relevant parties, and the servicer has received proof of funds or financing.\n          ", 
                        "The Bureau received comments from industry trade associations as well as consumer advocacy groups supporting a prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale while a loss mitigation application is pending or an appeal from a loan modification denial is pending. Numerous consumer advocate commenters also stated, as discussed above with respect to \u00a7 1024.41(f), that the Bureau should go further to bar servicers from beginning or continuing with a foreclosure process even before a foreclosure sale. Specifically, a consumer advocate stated that a servicer should be barred from proceeding to foreclosure judgment in a judicial foreclosure, not just from completing a foreclosure sale, because of the difficulty in delaying a foreclosure sale once a foreclosure judgment has been rendered.", 
                        "Conversely, a credit union trade association, a non-bank servicer, and an individual consumer stated that the Bureau should not implement regulations that may have the impact of further delaying the foreclosure process. An individual consumer indicated that regulations that delay foreclosure will reduce access to credit and disproportionately increase costs of credit for low and moderate income households and first time homebuyers. Further, a non-bank servicer stated that borrower action should not be required before a servicer can proceed to foreclosure.", 
                        "Finally, a non-bank servicer requested clarification regarding application of the prohibition to a short sale. Specifically, the commenter requested clarification regarding whether a servicer can proceed with a foreclosure sale if a property does not sell during a listing or marketing period for a short sale transaction.", 
                        "The Bureau finalizes the rule as proposed with three adjustments. First, the Bureau has adjusted the prohibition on proceeding with a foreclosure sale to state that a servicer shall not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale. Second, the Bureau has adopted further clarification regarding the impact of the requirements on short sale transactions. Third, the Bureau has adjusted the timing of the requirement consistent with other changes to the timing of \u00a7 1024.41 generally, as discussed above.", 
                        "As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes it is consistent with the purposes of RESPA, as well as with current market practice, to prohibit a servicer from completing the foreclosure process if a borrower has submitted a timely and complete application for a loss mitigation option until the servicer has completed the evaluation of the borrower for a loss mitigation option. In light of current market practice, the Bureau does not believe that \u00a7 1024.41(g) will have a substantial impact on expected foreclosure timelines. Significantly, the Bureau has structured the timelines for borrowers to submit complete loss mitigation applications, and for servicers to evaluate loss mitigation applications, consistently with the National Mortgage Settlement, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, and requirements currently imposed on servicers that service mortgage loans for the GSEs or government lending programs. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that the Bureau's requirements will substantially impact foreclosure timelines separate and apart from the baseline established as a result of current market practices. The Bureau also believes that avoiding the consumer harm caused by conducting a foreclosure sale before a servicer has completed an evaluation of a borrower for a loss mitigation option justifies any remaining concern regarding the potential impact on foreclosure timelines.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to clarify that the prohibition on conducting a foreclosure sale includes a prohibition that a servicer shall not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale. The final rule clarifies servicer obligations in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions and, moreover, is consistent with the requirements imposed on certain servicers under the National Mortgage Settlement.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau is also adding commentary to clarify the impact of this requirement on the foreclosure process. Comment 41(g)-1 clarifies the impact of the prohibition on moving for foreclosure judgment by dispositive motions. Specifically, comment 41(g)-1 states that the prohibition on a servicer moving for judgment or order of sale includes making a dispositive motion for foreclosure judgment, such as a motion for default judgment, judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, which may directly result in a judgment of foreclosure or order of sale. If a servicer has made any such motion before receiving a complete loss mitigation application, a servicer should make a good faith attempt to avoid the issuance of a judgment on any such motion prior to completing the procedures required by \u00a7 1024.41. In addition, comment 41(g)-2 clarifies how servicers may proceed with a foreclosure process. As stated in comment 41(g)-2, nothing in 1024.41(g) prohibits a servicer from continuing to move forward with a foreclosure process (assuming that the first notice or filing was made before a servicer received a complete loss mitigation application) so long as the servicer does not take an action that will directly result in the issuance of a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or a foreclosure sale. For example, if a servicer is required to engage in mediation or to make publications in a local paper, a servicer may proceed with any such requirements, so long as the applicable result of a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct of a foreclosure sale does not result from such action. The Bureau has also added comment 41(g)-3, which provides that a servicer is responsible for promptly instructing foreclosure counsel retained by the servicer not to proceed with filing for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or to conduct a foreclosure sale, in violation of \u00a7 1024.41(g) when a servicer has received a complete loss mitigation application.", 
                        "The Bureau has also clarified the application of \u00a7 1024.41 with respect to loss mitigation applications submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale in comment 41(g)-4. Comment 41(g)-4 clarifies that although a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 with respect to a loss mitigation application submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale, a servicer is required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v), to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options for which the borrower may be eligible pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Such evaluation may be subject to requirements applicable to a review of a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale.", 
                        "The Bureau also agrees that clarity is warranted regarding the impact of the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41(g)(3) on short sale transactions. The Bureau is finalizing comments 41(g)(3)-1 and 41(g)(3)-2, the substance of which was previously proposed as comments 41(g)(4)-1 and 41(g)(4)-2.\n            Comment 41(g)(3)-1 provides that a borrower is deemed to be performing under an agreement on a short sale, or other similar loss mitigation option, during the term of a marketing or listing period. Further comment 41(g)(3)-2 states that a borrower should be deemed to have obtained an approved short sale transaction if a short sale transaction has been approved by all relevant parties, including the servicer, other affected lienholders, or insurers, if applicable, and the servicer has received proof of funds or financing, unless circumstances otherwise indicate that an approved short sale transaction is not likely to occur. The Bureau has revised comment 41(g)(3)-2 in light of the public comments to further provide that if a borrower has not obtained an approved short sale transaction at the end of any marketing or listing period, a servicer may determine that a borrower has failed to perform under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. Finally, the Bureau has adjusted the timing requirements for \u00a7 1024.41(g) consistent with the discussion above regarding timelines."

If a servicer denied a borrower's appeal of a loss mitigation option, the servicer would have been permitted to proceed with a foreclosure sale.

The Bureau stated in the proposal that an appeal process for denials of loan modification options maintains consistency with existing appeals and escalation processes established under State law or Federal regulatory agency requirements. For example, the appeal processes established by the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights relate to denials of first lien loan modification denials.\n            Moreover, loan modifications are some of the most complex loss mitigation programs with respect to the evaluation of borrowers, and the Bureau stated that loan modifications provide an appropriate scope for an appeal process. The Bureau requested comment regarding the appeal requirements, including the impact of the appeal process on small servicers.", 
                        "Consumer advocates commented that the scope of the appeal process should be expanded beyond loan modifications to include appeals of denials for any loss mitigation option. A consumer advocate further stated that there should be transparent standards for appeals, requirements on the information that servicers must review, and disclosure to the consumer of the reasons an appeal was denied. A housing counselor supported the appeal process requirement but requested clarification regarding the timing of the deadlines. The commenter suggested using a postmark to determine when applicable timelines start.", 
                        "By contrast, industry commenters objected to the appeal process requirement. A credit union and a trade association stated that many investors, including the GSEs and government insurance programs, do not consider appeals and that requiring a second review is ultimately futile and wasteful. A law firm commented that the appeal process is unnecessary and overreaching because it is unreasonable to believe that servicers will not comply with current loss mitigation evaluation requirements. Further, the commenter stated that an appeals process will extend foreclosure timelines, which may ultimately harm the housing market without benefiting consumers.", 
                        "The GSEs commented that they also generally oppose an appeal process but emphasized that, in any event, an appeal process should be limited to a denial of a loan modification option and only where a loss mitigation application is submitted 90 days or more before a scheduled foreclosure sale. A Federal regulatory agency further commented that instead of a formal appeal process, the Bureau should provide a less formalized escalation process.", 
                        "Credit unions and their trade associations, as well as a community bank and a non-bank servicer, commented that the appeal process presents unique issues for small servicers. These commenters stated that small servicers could not implement the appeal process because small servicers generally have so few employees that it is not possible to assign a separate employee to handle an appeal. One trade association commented that, as a consequence, an appeal may be reviewed by staff that may not be appropriate to the task. A credit union and a credit union trade association also commented that supervisory personnel should be allowed to conduct appeals.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to require servicers to respond to appeals of denials for loan modification options. The Bureau's proposed requirement is consistent with other obligations imposed on servicers, including, as set forth above, obligations pursuant to the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Right. Consumers have consistently and forcefully complained that servicers have failed to review borrowers for loan modification options authorized by investors or guarantors of mortgage loans. Significantly, consumers and consumer advocates dispute in many individual instances whether servicers have properly applied the requirements of the Making Home Affordable program and the loan modification review requirements of the National Mortgage Settlement. Further, the terms of loan modification program reviews and compliance are complex and the Bureau understands from outreach with investors and guarantors of mortgage loans that servicers continue to have difficulty conducting the evaluations for loan modification programs pursuant to the guidelines and programs established by those investors and guarantors. Considering these factors, the Bureau believes that, as with any complex and unique process, servicers may make mistakes in evaluating borrowers for loan modification options. The notice that the Bureau is requiring servicers provide borrowers to explain the reasons for the denial of a loan modification, which include inputs that may have been the basis for such denials, may help uncover such mistakes. Many of these mistakes can then be corrected if a servicer undertakes a second review where a borrower believes that such further review is warranted. Thus, the Bureau believes that borrowers may reasonably benefit from the opportunity to have an independent review at a servicer where the borrower believes a mistake was made in the evaluation of a loan modification option.", 
                        "Further, the Bureau believes the scope and requirements of the appeal process as proposed are appropriate. The Bureau proposed limiting the scope of the appeal process to denials of loan modification options. Further, the appeal process would only have been available if a complete loss mitigation application was received 90 days or more before a scheduled foreclosure sale. These requirements are consistent with appeals processes set forth in the National Mortgage Settlement and the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and set an appropriate balance of processes that improve consumer protection when considered against burdens that may impact access and costs of credit for consumers. Although commenters focused on whether the process should be characterized as an \u201cappeal\u201d process or an \u201cescalation\u201d process, this semantic distinction does not affect the actual requirements that would be imposed on servicers. Essentially, if a borrower believes that a servicer made a mistake regarding the evaluation of a borrower for a loan modification option, the borrower can indicate that to the servicer. The servicer would be required to ensure that personnel other than those that made the initial determination review the borrower's evaluation and determine whether to offer the borrower a loss mitigation option. The Bureau also believes the timing of the loss mitigation procedures, including the appeal process, are clear. All such deadlines are based on when information is received or provided by a servicer.", 
                        "Although the Bureau believes that servicers should review borrower appeals and make a determination regarding whether the servicer shall offer the borrower a loss mitigation option, the Bureau declines to establish guidelines for appeals. As set forth above, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to allow investors or guarantors, including most notably the GSEs and FHA, to establish their own requirements and to determine the extent to which they want those requirements to be enforceable through private litigation.",

A servicer would not have been required to comply with the requirements of proposed \u00a7 1024.41 if a borrower had previously been evaluated for loss mitigation options for the borrower's mortgage loan account by that servicer.", 
                        "In the proposal, the Bureau stated that where servicing was transferred after the borrower received an evaluation on a complete loss mitigation application from the transferor servicer, the transferee servicer still may be required to comply with the requirements of proposed \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau believes that when an investor or guarantor is transferring servicing to a new servicer, which may have been driven by an investor's or guarantor's determination that the new servicer can better achieve loss mitigation options with borrowers, borrowers should be able to renew an application for a loss mitigation option with the transferee servicer, subject to the applicable deadlines and requirements in proposed \u00a7 1024.41.", 
                        "The Bureau requested comment regarding whether a borrower should be entitled to renewed evaluation for a loss mitigation option if an appropriate time period has passed since the initial evaluation or if there is a material change in the borrower's circumstances.", 
                        "A consumer advocate coalition commented that servicers should be required to review a subsequent loss mitigation submission when a borrower has demonstrated a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances. Conversely, a trade association supported the Bureau's proposal stating that it would ensure that adequate time and resources are devoted to borrowers applying for the first time for a loss mitigation option.", 
                        "A non-bank servicer stated concerns that requiring review of renewed applications would obstruct a servicer's ability to proceed with an inevitable foreclosure sale. The commenter indicated that renewed applications may not actually reflect a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances and may only constitute a strategic attempt to delay the foreclosure process. The commenter suggested that if a servicer is required to review a renewed loss mitigation application, a borrower should have a restricted time period for submitting such information and a servicer should only be required to comply with an expedited review process. Finally, after further consideration, the Bureau believed it appropriate to clarify the application of the loss mitigation procedures if servicing is transferred for a borrower's mortgage loan account.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 to a review of a single complete loss mitigation application. Specifically, the Bureau believes that a limitation on the loss mitigation procedures to a single complete loss mitigation application provides appropriate incentives for borrowers to submit all appropriate information in the application and allows servicers to dedicate resources to reviewing applications most capable of succeeding on loss mitigation options. Further, the Bureau is cognizant that the borrowers may pursue a private right of action to enforce the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.41 and significant challenges exist to determine whether a material change in financial circumstances has occurred and, if so, what procedures should be required. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing the rule as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees, however, that there is merit to providing protections for a borrower that has had a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances after a review of an initial loss mitigation application. Accordingly, as discussed above for \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(v), servicers are required to implement policies and procedures to achieve the objective of reviewing borrowers for loss mitigation options pursuant to requirements established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. The Bureau understands from outreach that many owners or assignees of mortgage loans require servicers to consider material changes in financial circumstances in connection with evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options and servicer policies and procedures must be designed to implement those requirements.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to clarify the application of the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 when servicing for a mortgage loan has been transferred. As set forth in the proposal, a transferee servicer would have been required to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41, notwithstanding whether a borrower has received a determination on a complete loss mitigation application from a transferor servicer. To the extent that an evaluation for a loss mitigation option is in process with a transferor servicer, but a borrower has not finalized an agreement on a loss mitigation option, the Bureau believes it is appropriate for a transferee servicer to comply with the loss mitigation procedures, including reviewing a borrower again for all available loss mitigation options.", 
                        "The Bureau, therefore, has added comments 41(i)-1 and 41(i)-2 to clarify a transferee servicer's obligations in connection with a servicing transfer for a borrower that has submitted a loss mitigation application. Comment 41(i)-1 provides that a transferee servicer is required to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 regardless of whether a borrower received an evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application from a transferor servicer. Further, comment 41(i)-1 states that documents and information transferred from a transferor servicer to a transferee servicer may constitute a loss mitigation application to the transferee servicer and may cause a transferee servicer to be required to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41 with respect to a borrower's mortgage loan account. Comment 41(i)-2 states that a transferee servicer must obtain documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application pending at the time of a servicing transfer, consistent with policies and procedures adopted pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38, and must continue the evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application to the extent practicable. Comment 41(i)-2 further provides that for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41(e)(1), 1024.41(f), 1024.41(g), and 1024.41(h), a transferee servicer must consider documents and information received from a transferor servicer that constitute a complete loss mitigation application for the transferee servicer to have been received by the transferee servicer as of the date such documents and information were provided to the transferor servicer. The purpose of this clarification is to ensure that a servicing transfer does not have the consequence of depriving a borrower of protections to which a borrower was entitled from the transferor servicer in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41.", 
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau finalizes \u00a7 1024.41(i) as proposed. The Bureau finalizes the comments to \u00a7 1024.41(i) to clarify the impact of the requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 in connection with servicing transfers."

                                "As previously stated above, the proposed rule applied all of the loss mitigation provisions to small servicers. For the reasons previously discussed with respect to \u00a7 1024.30, the Bureau has concluded that the available evidence indicates that the concerns underlying the loss mitigation provisions arise in the context of larger servicers and that the benefits of applying all of these requirements to small servicers who service loans they or an affiliate own or originated may not be justified by the burdens on these small servicers.", 
                                "There are, however, two elements of the loss mitigation rules that the Bureau believes should be applied across all servicers. First, new \u00a7 1024.41(j) states that a small servicer is required to comply with requirements similar to those in \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1) by not making the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure process unless a borrower is more than 120 days delinquent. Second, a small servicer shall not proceed to foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conduct a foreclosure sale, if a borrower is performing pursuant to the terms of an agreement on a loss mitigation option.", 
                                "The Bureau has no reason to believe that any small servicers, servicing loans they or an affiliate owns or originated, in fact commence foreclosure before a borrower is at least 120 days delinquent or either commence a foreclosure process or conduct a foreclosure sale if a borrower is performing under an agreed-upon loss mitigation program. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes these protections, which are discussed in more detail above, are such essential standards that all borrowers should understand that they are entitled to protection from consumer harms relating to dual tracking notwithstanding the size of the servicer. The Bureau believes that imposing only these limited requirements on small servicers creates easily understood and clearly implemented consumer protections while appropriately calibrating the burdens that small servicers may incur."

If a servicer determines that any other servicers service a mortgage loan for the property, the servicer would be required to provide the loss mitigation application received from the borrower to the other servicer. This provision was intended to require servicers of other liens that were not the original recipient to become engaged in the loss mitigation evaluation process by requiring such servicers to apply the loss mitigation procedures to loss mitigation applications received from other servicers on behalf of the borrower.", 
                        "Numerous commenters, including large banks, community banks, credit unions, their respective trade associations, the GSEs, a law firm, and a housing finance agency, objected to the proposed rule. These commenters stated that the proposed rule raises significant concerns regarding consumer welfare. First, the required transmittal of borrower personal information among servicers raises significant privacy concerns for borrowers. Second, borrowers that are current on other mortgage loans may be harmed by requiring information sharing among mortgage servicers. For example, a borrower that is current on a subordinate lien HELOC that is not fully utilized may find that the HELOC line has been frozen even though the borrower expects to need to draw on the additional credit that would have been available. Third, servicers would be required to undertake the expense of a title search to identify other liens, the costs for which would be passed on to a borrower, even though a borrower likely knows whether another lien and servicer exist.", 
                        "Commenters also stated that servicers could not reasonably comply with the proposed rule. Servicers indicated that they could not identify whether other mortgage liens exist from a title search within 5 days. A small credit union commented that credit unions lack the expertise, staffing, and training to ensure compliance with the requirement. Commenters also identified other operational problems, including delays and logistical problems identifying appropriate personnel to receive loss mitigation applications at other servicers, and problems relating to exchanging potentially proprietary information relating to collecting information for a loss mitigation application.", 
                        "Commenters suggested different approaches for involving servicers of other mortgage liens in loss mitigation evaluations. A financial industry trade association suggested that the Bureau require servicers to inform borrowers that they may wish to contact a servicer for another mortgage loan to obtain an evaluation for a loss mitigation option. Another industry commenter suggested that the Bureau sponsor a database for exchanging lienholder information and submitting and storing borrower applications. Further, a consumer advocate coalition suggested that the Bureau implement requirements regarding re-subordination of a junior lien after a loan modification. Specifically, the commenter states that a servicer should be required to secure a re-subordination of a junior lien to a modified mortgage loan secured by a senior lien. The commenter further states that a servicer should be prohibited from rejecting a loan modification even where a title problem exists or where another lienholder refuses to re-subordinate its lien to a modified mortgage loan.", 
                        "Some of the most difficult loss mitigation situations for consumers and owners or assignees of mortgage loans involve properties secured by multiple mortgage liens. Loss mitigation options for such properties can be significantly impeded or delayed because of miscommunications, lack of coordination, and differing interests among servicers of senior and subordinate liens. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, when servicers hold a second lien that is behind a first lien owned by a different owner or assignee, one study has found a lower likelihood of liquidation and modification, and a higher likelihood of inaction by a servicer. Specifically, \u201cliquidation and modification of securitized first mortgages are 60 percent [to] 70 percent less likely respectively and no action is 13 percent more likely when the servicer of that securitized first mortgage holds on its portfolio the second lien attached to the first mortgage.\u201d\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1024.41(j) to require servicers to coordinate on evaluations of borrowers for loss mitigation options. However, commenters have identified significant concerns with the requirement as proposed. For example, with respect to privacy concerns, the Bureau observed in the proposal that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as implemented by Regulation P did not require provision of an initial notice and opt-out in connection with providing the loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower to another servicer under the exception set forth in 12 CFR 1016.15(a)(7). However, notwithstanding that servicers may provide personal information to additional servicers pursuant to applicable law, the Bureau finds persuasive the concerns raised by servicers with respect to the potential privacy implications regarding the circulation of borrower personal information among servicers.", 
                        "In light of the comments, the Bureau has determined to withdraw the substance of proposed \u00a7 1024.41(j). The Bureau is requiring that a servicer inform a borrower in the notice required by \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options. Although a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements that would have been implemented by proposed \u00a7 1024.41(j), the Bureau believes that borrowers should be aware of the potential complications to achieving a loss mitigation option in situations where multiple liens exist."

Proposed comment 1 to appendix MS would have explained that to use such forms and clauses appropriately, information required by regulation must be set forth in the disclosures.

Thus, the Bureau proposed to streamline the language of the model form to focus on only the elements of information that a borrower needs in connection with a mortgage servicing transfer, specifically (1) the date of the transfer, (2) contact information for the transferor servicer, (3) contact information for the transferee servicer, (4) applicable dates for when each of the servicers will begin or cease to accept payments, (5) the impact of the transfer on any insurance products and (6) a statement that the transfer does not otherwise affect the terms or conditions of the mortgage loan.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to remove significant discussion in the model form regarding the complaint resolution process and the borrower's rights pursuant to RESPA. Two consumer advocacy groups submitted comment requesting that the Bureau not remove information about a borrower's complaint resolution rights under RESPA. For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.33(b)(4) above, the Bureau is omitting language about complaint resolution from appendix MS-2.", 
                        "The Bureau's proposed amendments to appendix MS-2 also would have omitted language informing borrowers of the prohibition in RESPA section 6(d) (as implemented through current \u00a7 1024.21(d)(5)). Appendix MS-2 currently informs borrowers, in general, that pursuant to RESPA section 6, during the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by the borrower's old servicer before its due date may not be treated by the new loan servicer as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on the borrower. Upon further consideration, and in light of comment received with respect to the complaint resolution statement, the Bureau believes this information should be retained in appendix MS-2 because the Bureau believes information about misdirected payments is uniquely relevant to borrowers during a servicing transfer (unlike the complaint resolution statement, which the Bureau believes should be made available to borrowers in circumstances that do not necessarily depend on the transfer of servicing). Additionally, in light of its brevity, the Bureau does not believe its inclusion will significantly add to the length of the form. While the Bureau did not test this statement, the Bureau does not believe it is likely to cause confusion or present comprehension problems in light of its simplicity and because it includes language substantially similar to what appears in the current model form. Accordingly, the Bureau has retained the substance of the current statement about late payments and has omitted the prefatory language about a borrower's rights under RESPA section 6 with a more general statement.", 
                        "The Bureau has amended existing language in the statement that explains that a payment received \u201cbefore its due date\u201d would not be treated as late to more accurately reflect the requirement in \u00a7 1024.33(c)(1). The language appearing in the model form now provides, \u201cUnder Federal law, during the 60-day period following the effective date of the transfer of the loan servicing, a loan payment received by your old servicer on or before its due date may not be treated by the new servicer as late, and a late fee may not be imposed on you.\u201d\n          ", 
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Consumer testing.</em> To test consumer comprehension of the revised model form proposed by the Bureau, the Bureau contracted with Macro to conduct eight qualitative interviews during one round of consumer testing in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area on November 7, 2012. After reading the notice, all participants understood that they would have to send their payments to a different servicer after the date listed in the notice. All participants saw the contact information for both the transferor and transferee servicers. Most participants also understood the basic relationship between a lender and a servicer.", 
                        "During this round of testing, the Bureau was interested in whether participants preferred a form that listed the transferor and transferee servicer contact information in a side-by-side fashion, as opposed to a vertical fashion, as the form proposed by the Bureau would have been formatted. The Bureau expected that listing the transferor and transferee servicers in a side-by-side fashion would enhance consumer comprehension of who the old and new servicers are. To test this, the Macro showed participants the original notice (Version A) and asked participants a series of questions to measure their understanding of the notice. Macro then showed participants a reformatted notice (Version B) and asked which version they preferred. All participants said they preferred Version B. They commented that the format of Version B was easier to read and understand, and that the current and new servicers were easier to identify at a glance.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing appendix MS-2 with substantially the same content as proposed. However, the Bureau has retained, with certain modifications discussed above, language in current appendix MS-2 about the treatment of payments during the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer. The Bureau has also reformatted the model form to list the contact information for the transferor and transferee servicers in a side-by-side fashion."

                        "In the 2012 RESPA Mortgage Servicing Proposal, the Bureau proposed model clauses in new appendix MS-4 to illustrate the disclosures that would be required under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(1). The Bureau developed the proposed model clauses to encourage the borrower to contact the servicer and provide information about loss mitigation options, foreclosure, and housing counselors. The Bureau developed the proposed clauses based on its own analysis and review of existing notices for delinquent borrowers, such as the HUD \u201cAvoiding Foreclosure\u201d pamphlet.\n            Several consumer advocacy groups supported the Bureau's decision to provide model clauses but recommended that the Bureau require standardized notices for all servicers because they were concerned that servicers are not consistent in the way they describe loss mitigation options. Industry commenters generally requested more flexibility in the way the notices are provided. Macro conducted one round of consumer testing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to assess consumer comprehension of the proposed early intervention model clauses. The Bureau also notes that Macro conducted three rounds of one-on-one cognitive interviews to test disclosure forms for the Bureau's proposed ARM interest rate adjustment notices, which the Bureau is finalizing in the 2013 TILA Servicing Final Rule. The ARM interest rate adjustment notices contained clauses describing loss mitigation options and contact information to access housing counseling resources.", 
                        "Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(A) illustrated how a servicer may provide its contact information and how a servicer may request that the borrower contact the servicer, as would have been required under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(i) and (ii). Consumer testing indicated that all participants understood from this statement\n            that if they were having trouble making their payments, they should contact their bank to see what options may be available.\n\n            Several participants specifically noticed the sentence stating that \u201cThe longer you wait, or the further you fall behind on your payments, the harder it will be to find a solution.\u201d These participants said this sentence would make them more likely to contact their bank. Participants generally thought that this statement was similar to a separate statement illustrating how the servicer may inform the borrower how to obtain additional information about loss mitigation options, as would have been required under \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(iv), as illustrated in proposed MS-4(C).\n            Most participants responded positively to these statements and believed that their bank was reaching out towards a solution, although two participants thought that the statements could be more polite or resembled an advertisement rather than a communication from their bank. Separately, during the public comment process, one credit union commenter also noted that the tone in the model notices did not necessarily reflect the way it communicated with their borrowers and requested more flexibility with respect to how the notices are worded.", 
                        "The Bureau believes that the clauses required under \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) may be combined into a single clause, as illustrated in Model MS-4(A) that the Bureau is adopting in the final rule. Both clauses in proposed MS-4(C) and MS-4(A) instruct borrowers to contact the servicer to discuss their options, and the statement instructing borrowers to contact their servicer to learn more about how to apply in proposed MS-4(C) is very closely related. The Bureau is not otherwise changing the phrasing of statements as proposed. Most testing participants reacted favorably to the proposed clauses, and the Bureau notes that servicers can make minor modifications to the sample clauses, pursuant to general comment MS-2 to appendix MS. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the model clauses are not required; they only illustrated how the required statements in \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) can be provided.", 
                        "Model MS-4(A) contains a bracketed clause stating, \u201cThe longer you wait, or the further you fall behind on your payments, the harder it will be to find a solution.\u201d The Bureau has included this statement in brackets because it is optional, but the Bureau is including it as recommended language that the Bureau believes will help encourage borrowers to contact their servicer.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau has omitted the clause stating \u201cWe may be able to make your mortgage more affordable\u201d from proposed MS-4(A). During consumer testing, participants were concerned that the statement was potentially misleading. The Bureau does not believe this language is necessary to encourage delinquent borrowers to contact their servicer. That statement also appeared in proposed MS-4(B), illustrating proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) (brief description of loss mitigation options). The Bureau has deleted this clause in MS-4(B) for the same reason.",

The proposed clauses in Model MS-4(B) illustrated four commonly offered examples: (1) Forbearance, (2) mortgage modification, (3) short-sale, and (4) deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(B), all participants understood the overall message of the statement\u2014that if they were having difficulty making a mortgage payment, their bank may be able to offer options to help them. After reading the clauses, while participants generally could explain what a forbearance and a loan modification were, only approximately half of the participants could explain \u201cshort-sale\u201d and \u201cdeed-in-lieu.\u201d All but one of the participants understood the primary difference between options that would let borrowers remain in their homes (forbearance and mortgage modification) and options that would require that the borrower leave their home (short-sale and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure). All participants understood that the fact that they received this notice did not mean that they would necessarily qualify for these options.", 
                        "During the public comment process, one large servicer requested clarification that servicers only be required to list loss mitigation options to the extent those options are available from the servicer. Another large servicer recommended that clauses illustrating deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and short sales include language noting that lenders may seek a deficiency obligation from the borrower, except in the case of bankruptcy.", 
                        "The Bureau is not finalizing the Model Clauses proposed as Model MS-4(B). Instead, the Bureau is finalizing MS-4(B) by including clauses substantially similar to ones that the Bureau developed over the course of several rounds of consumer testing of the ARM disclosures contained in \u00a7 1026.20, which the Bureau tested prior to publication of the 2012 TILA Mortgage Servicing Proposal and that tested better than the options described in proposed MS-4. The Bureau recognizes that these examples of loss mitigation options may not necessarily accurately reflect a servicer's loss mitigation programs. Thus, comment MS-4-2 explained that the language in Model MS-4(B) is optional, and that a servicer may add or substitute any examples of loss mitigation options the servicer offers, as long as the information required to be disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. The Bureau noted in its proposal that if the servicer offered no loss mitigation options, a servicer may not include Models MS-4(B) and MS-4(C) because including those statements would be misleading.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed comment MS-4-2 clarifying appropriate use of model clause MS-4(B). The comment explained that Model MS-4(B) does not contain sample clauses for all loss mitigation options that may be available. Comment MS-4-2 also explained that the language in the model clauses contained in square brackets is optional, and that a servicer may comply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) by using language substantially similar to the language in the model clauses, or by adding or substituting applicable loss mitigation options for options not represented in these model clauses, as long as the information required to be disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. The Bureau is adopting comment MS-4-2 substantially as proposed.", 
                        "In response to industry concerns, the Bureau has also added language to comment MS-4-2 to explain that servicers may use clauses to illustrate options to the extent they are available. In addition, the Bureau has clarified that servicers may provide additional detail about the options, provided the information disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous. This clarification responds to industry commenters' recommendation to clarify that servicers may explain that the discussion of certain options, such as a short sale, may require deficiency obligations from the borrower.", 
                        "Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(D) illustrated how a servicer may explain foreclosure and provide the estimated number of days in which the servicer may begin the foreclosure process, as would have been required under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(v). During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(D), participants had mixed reactions to the foreclosure statement. Participants understood that this notice was intended to provide the consumer with a definition of the term \u201cforeclosure\u201d and to warn them that foreclosure could be a possibility in their future because of a missed payment. However, participants appeared to understand what foreclosure was even before reading this clause. Therefore, they did not appear to learn much from reading the first sentence of this clause.\n            A few participants specifically commented that this sentence seemed out of place, because it was a definition rather than a statement specifically about their situation. The Bureau tested a hypothetical estimated 90-150 day timeframe for when foreclosure could occur. When asked when lenders could begin to pursue foreclosure, all participants referred to the 90 to 150 day timeframe in the clause, and understood that this time period would start from the due date of their missed payment. However, at least two participants mistakenly thought that the reference to this time period implied that the foreclosure process could not start sooner than 90 days after the missed payment, despite the fact that the clause states that the process \u201cmay begin earlier or later.\u201d\n            One participant felt strongly that if it was true that the foreclosure process could start in less than 90 days, then the reference to the \u201c90 to 150 day\u201d time period should be removed from the clause because it was misleading. For the reasons explained in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2) above, the Bureau has omitted the clauses in proposed MS-4(D) that illustrated how a servicer could explain foreclosure and provide the estimated number of days in which the servicer may begin the foreclosure process, as would have been required under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(v).", 
                        "Proposed clauses in Model MS-4(E) illustrated how the servicer may provide contact information for the State housing finance authority and housing counselors, as would have been required under proposed \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2)(vi). During consumer testing of proposed MS-4(E), all participants understood that the purpose of this message was to provide contact information for the Federal government agency identified in the clause.\n            Contact information for accessing housing counseling resources was also tested during previous rounds of testing of the ARM interest rate adjustment notice. The Bureau is adopting in the final rule the clauses substantially as proposed setting forth contact information for either the Bureau or HUD Web site to access a list of housing counselor or counseling organizations, as well as the HUD telephone number to access the list of HUD-approved counselors. The Bureau is renumbering MS-4(E) as MS-4(C). For the reasons discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.39(b)(2), the Bureau is omitting contact information for State housing finance authorities."
