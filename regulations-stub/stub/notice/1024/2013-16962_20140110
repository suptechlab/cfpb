The Bureau also notes that permitting the list to include individual counselors could cause confusion for consumers, as an individual counselor may be unavailable. The Bureau is therefore exercising its exemption and modification authority under RESPA section 19(a) and the Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to provide flexibility in order to facilitate the availability of competent counseling organizations for placement on the lists, so that counseling organizations that are either approved or certified by HUD may appear on the lists. Permitting the list to include HUD-approved or HUD-certified counseling organizations will help facilitate the effective functioning of this new RESPA disclosure. It will also, therefore, help carry out the purposes of RESPA for more effective advance cost disclosures for consumers, by providing information to loan applicants regarding counseling resources available for assisting them in understanding their prospective mortgage loans and settlement costs.
