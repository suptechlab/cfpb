    "abstract": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is delaying until October 3, 2015, the effective date of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule and the related TILA-RESPA Amendments. In light of certain procedural requirements under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the TILA-RESPA Final Rule and the TILA-RESPA Amendments cannot take effect on August 1, 2015, as originally provided by those rules. To comply with the CRA and to help ensure the smooth implementation of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, the Bureau is extending the effective date of both the TILA-RESPA Final Rule and the TILA-RESPA Amendments beyond the additional minimum period required by the CRA to October 3, 2015, as proposed. The Bureau is also making certain technical amendments to the Official Interpretations of Regulation Z to reflect the new effective date and technical corrections to two provisions of Regulation Z adopted by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule.",

The Bureau's revisions to Regulation X and Regulation Z published on December 31, 2013 (the TILA-RESPA Final Rule), apply to covered loans (closed-end credit transactions secured by real property) for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015 (the \u201ceffective date\u201d), except that new \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2), the amendments to \u00a7 1026.28(a)(1), and the amendments to the commentary to \u00a7 1026.29, become effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received. The provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) apply prior to a consumer's receipt of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and therefore, restrict activity that may occur prior to receipt of an application by a creditor or mortgage broker under \u00a7 1026.19(e). These provisions include \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer's application. Accordingly, the provisions under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. In addition, the amendments to \u00a7 1026.28 and the commentary to \u00a7 1026.29 govern the preemption of State laws and thus, the amendments to those provisions and associated commentary made by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. The following examples illustrate the application of the effective date for the TILA-RESPA Final Rule."

To determine the amount of cash or other funds the consumer is to provide at consummation, the tables must account for the sales price of any tangible personal property being sold in a purchase real estate transaction that is excluded from the contract sales price, as disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iii). The TILA-RESPA Final Rule does not specify a place within the Calculating Cash to Close table on the Closing Disclosure for this amount. However, comment 37(h)(1)(vii)-6, relating to the Calculating Cash to Close table on the Loan Estimate, indicates that the sales price of additional personal property can be included in the Adjustments and Other Credits amount. To conform this aspect of the Closing Disclosure to the Loan Estimate, the Bureau is amending \u00a7 1026.38(i)(8)(ii) to include the amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iii) in the amount disclosed as \u201cFinal\u201d for Adjustments and Other Credits. This change will ensure that the Calculating Cash to Close table on the Closing Disclosure accurately reflects the total amount of cash or other funds that the consumer must provide at consummation and will complete the alignment of the disclosure of Adjustments and Other Credits between the Closing Disclosure and the Loan Estimate. The Bureau believes this is consistent with industry expectations of the proper disclosure of the Adjustments and Other Credits on both the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and will reduce uncertainty in implementation by confirming that the calculation of Adjustments and Other Credits is the same on both the Closing Disclosure and the Loan Estimate.", 
                        "The Bureau is also making a conforming change to \u00a7 1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). That paragraph requires creditors to disclose the basis for any difference between the Adjustments and Other Credits disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Adjustments and Other Credits disclosed as \u201cFinal\u201d on the Closing Disclosure (unless the difference is due to rounding). As explained in comment 38(i)-3, creditors may disclose the basis for the difference by providing a general or specific line cross-reference to the Summaries of Transactions table. This conforming change will permit creditors to cross-reference to the personal property sales price disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iii) as a basis for the calculation of the amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(8)(ii). This modification is unlikely to change creditors' practice because creditors may provide consumers with a more general cross-reference to the Summaries of Transactions table and need not provide a specific line cross-reference.", 
                        "These changes to \u00a7 1026.38(i)(8) will also ensure that the amount disclosed as due to or from the consumer in the Calculating Cash to Close table on the Closing Disclosure matches the amount disclosed as due to or from the consumer in the Summaries of Transactions table on the Closing Disclosure. As alignment between these two disclosures is required by existing comment 38(i)(9)(ii)-1, this change should facilitate implementation and is consistent with existing industry preparations and informal guidance provided by the Bureau."

                        "In the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.38(j) provides for a summary of the borrower's transaction on the Closing Disclosure. The total amount due from or to the consumer at the real estate closing in this Summaries of Transactions table should match the disclosure of the \u201cFinal\u201d cash to close on the Calculating Cash to Close table pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(i)(9)(ii) (as explained in comment 38(i)(9)(ii)-1).", 
                        "For the Summaries of Transactions table, the disclosure of the total amount of closing costs that are designated borrower-paid at closing is specified in \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iv). In the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iv) provides that the total amount of closing costs disclosed that are designated borrower-paid at closing is calculated pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2). As originally proposed in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal, \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2) included the lender credits described in \u00a7 1026.38(h)(3).\n          In the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, however, the Bureau removed the lender credits set forth in \u00a7 1026.38(h)(3) from the calculation in \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2) in order to reconcile the Calculating Cash to Close table in \u00a7 1026.38(i). In doing so, the Bureau inadvertently failed to adjust \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iv) to include the lender credits disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(h)(3).", 
                        "As a result, under the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, the total amount due from or to the consumer at the real estate closing in the Summaries of Transactions table may not match the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of cash to close disclosed in the Calculating Cash to Close table under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(9)(ii). To correct this, the Bureau is modifying \u00a7 1026.38(j)(1)(iv) to require disclosure of the sum of the amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2) and the amount of any lender credits disclosed as a negative number under \u00a7 1026.38(h)(3). The lender credits described in \u00a7 1026.38(h)(3) are appropriately and necessarily included in the summary of the borrower's transaction as an offsetting credit to the amount due from the borrower at closing. This change makes the Summaries of Transactions table accurately reflect the total amount due from or to the consumer at the real estate closing; comports the disclosure of the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of cash to close in the Calculating Cash to Close table with the amount disclosed in the Summaries of Transactions table as required by existing comment 38(i)(9)(ii)-1; and is consistent with informal guidance provided by the Bureau."

The Bureau proposed to have the instruction take effect on October 3, 2015, instead of August 1, 2015, to preserve this coordination. The Bureau received no comments specifically relating to this proposed amendment. The Bureau is finalizing this change to the amendatory instruction as proposed."
