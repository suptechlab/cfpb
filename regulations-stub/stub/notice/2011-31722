    "abstract": "Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) transferred rulemaking authority for a number of consumer financial protection laws from seven Federal agencies to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) as of July 21, 2011. The Bureau is in the process of republishing the regulations implementing those laws with technical and conforming changes to reflect the transfer of authority and certain other changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act. In light of the transfer of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) rulemaking authority for the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) to the Bureau, the Bureau is publishing for public comment an interim final rule establishing a new Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act). This interim final rule does not impose any new substantive obligations on persons subject to the existing Regulation X, previously published by HUD.",
