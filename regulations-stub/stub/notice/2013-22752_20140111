    "abstract": "This final rule amends some of the final mortgage rules issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) in January 2013. These amendments focus primarily on loss mitigation procedures under Regulation X's servicing provisions, amounts counted as loan originator compensation to retailers of manufactured homes and their employees for purposes of applying points and fees thresholds under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act and the Ability-to-Repay rules in Regulation Z, exemptions available to creditors that operate predominantly in ``rural or underserved'' areas for various purposes under the mortgage regulations, application of the loan originator compensation rules to bank tellers and similar staff, and the prohibition on creditor-financed credit insurance. The Bureau also is adjusting the effective dates for certain provisions of the loan originator compensation rules. In addition, the Bureau is adopting technical and wording changes for clarification purposes to Regulations B, X, and Z.",

Under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the individual loan originator may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred compensation, and the compensation under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the person (<E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>the person may elect not to pay compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan in a given year), provided the compensation is not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions. As used in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based compensation plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. Compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profits of the person, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable. As used in \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational structure of the person or the person's affiliate that performs discrete business functions and that the person or the affiliate treats separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example, a creditor that pays its individual loan originators bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the creditor's average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to an individual loan originator from a source other than a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan (or a deferred compensation plan where the bonus is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits), such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of compensation based on the terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not apply to such bonuses.",

For compensation subject to the 10-percent limit, the relevant time period is the time period for which a person makes reference to profits in determining the compensation (<E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>when the compensation was earned). It does not matter whether the compensation is actually paid during that particular time period. For total compensation, the relevant time period is the same time period, but only certain types of compensation may be included in the total compensation amount for that time period (see comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.A). For example, assume that during calendar year 2014 a creditor pays an individual loan originator compensation in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the individual loan originator's performance and volume of loans generated during the calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the individual loan originator. The creditor desires to pay the individual loan originator a year-end bonus of $10,000 under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan are made during calendar year 2014, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2015. For purposes of the 10-percent limit, the year-end bonus is counted toward the 10-percent limit for calendar year 2014, even though it is not actually paid until 2015. Therefore, for calendar year 2014 the individual loan originator's compensation that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (<E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>the year-end bonus) and the total compensation would be $100,000 (<E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>the sum of the commissions, the designated tax-advantaged plan contribution (assuming the creditor elects to include it in total compensation for calendar year 2014), and the bonus (assuming the creditor elects to include it in total compensation for calendar year 2014)); the bonus would be permissible under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) because it does not exceed 10 percent of total compensation. The determination of total compensation corresponding to 2014 also would not take into account any compensation subject to the 10-percent limit that is actually paid in 2014 but is earned during a different calendar year (<E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>an annual bonus determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits for calendar year 2013 that is paid in January 2014). If the employer contribution to the designated tax-advantaged plan is earned in 2014 but actually made in 2015, however, it may not be included in total compensation for 2014. A company, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable, may pay compensation subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a creditor uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the creditor pays an individual loan originator a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The creditor can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of the quarterly bonuses.",

Because the performance bonus is paid out of a bonus pool that is determined with reference to the profits of the mortgage origination business unit, it is compensation that is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits, and the bonus is therefore subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit. If the company-wide bonus pool from which the \u201choliday\u201d bonus is paid is derived in part from profits of the creditor's mortgage origination business unit, then the combination of the \u201choliday\u201d bonus and the performance bonus is subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit. The \u201choliday\u201d bonus is not subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit if the bonus pool is determined with reference only to the profits of business units other than the mortgage origination business unit, as determined in accordance with reasonable accounting principles. If the \u201cperformance\u201d bonus and the \u201choliday\u201d bonus in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation, the bonuses may be paid under \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) without the necessity of determining from which bonus pool they were paid or whether they were determined with reference to the profits of the creditor's mortgage origination business unit.",

As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Dodd-Frank Act section 1474 amended ECOA by, among other things, defining \u201cvaluation\u201d to include any <em data-original=\"E-03\">estimate</em> of the value of the dwelling developed in connection with a creditor's decisions to provide credit. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> ECOA section 701(e)(6). Similarly, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule adopted &#167; 1002.14(b)(3), which defines &#8220;valuation&#8221; as any <em data-original=\"E-03\">estimate</em> of the value of a dwelling developed in connection with an application for credit. Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau intended the term &#8220;valuation&#8221; to refer only to an estimate for purposes of the 2013 ECOA Final Rule's newly adopted provisions. However, the 2013 ECOA Final Rule added two comments that refer to a valuation as an appraiser's estimate or opinion of the value of the property: comment 14(b)(3)-1.i, which gives examples of &#8220;valuations,&#8221; as defined by &#167; 1002.14(b)(3); and comment 14(b)(3)-3.v, which provides examples of documents that discuss or restate a valuation of an applicant's property but nevertheless do not constitute &#8220;valuations&#8221; under &#167; 1002.14(b)(3).", 
                                "Because the Bureau did not intend by these two comments to alter the meaning of \u201cvaluation\u201d to become inconsistent with ECOA section 701(e)(6) and \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3), the Bureau proposed to clarify comments 14(b)(3)-1.i and 14(b)(3)-3.v by removing the words \u201cor opinion\u201d from their texts, and sought comment on the clarification."

In proposing these amendments, the Bureau intended to clarify that the comments referred to appraisals or other valuation models by removing the word \u201copinion,\u201d which could be read broadly to include even speculative opinions not based on an appraisal or other valuation model. However, in light of the trade association's comments the Bureau believes that simply deleting the word \u201copinion\u201d could also cause confusion regarding whether and how the rule applies to appraisals that are commonly described as \u201copinions of value.\u201d Thus, the Bureau is substituting \u201copinion of value\u201d for \u201copinion\u201d rather than deleting the word entirely. The Bureau is adopting revised comment 14(b)(3)-1.i with this change. The Bureau is adopting comment 14(b)(3)-3.v as proposed, and does not believe any additional revisions are necessary in light of this clarification, because the comment deals exclusively with reports reflecting property inspections and not appraisals. However, the Bureau is adding new comment 14(b)(3)-3.vi to clarify that appraisal reviews that do not provide an estimate of value or \u201copinion of value\u201d are included in the list of examples of items that are not considered \u201cvaluations\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1002.14(b)(3)."

Section 1024.35 implements section 6(k)(1)(C) of RESPA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, and \u00a7 1024.36 implements section 6(k)(1)(D) of RESPA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. To the extent the requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36 are applicable to qualified written requests, these provisions also implement sections 6(e) and 6(k)(1)(B) of RESPA. As discussed in part III (Legal Authority), the Bureau is finalizing these amendments pursuant to its authority under RESPA sections 6(j), 6(k)(1)(E) and 19(a). As explained in more detail below, the Bureau believes these provisions are necessary and appropriate to achieve the consumer protection purposes of RESPA, including ensuring responsiveness to consumer requests and complaints and the provision and maintenance of accurate and relevant information."

Section 1024.35(c), as adopted by the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, state that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit a notice of error to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.35. Comment 35(c)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer. Similarly, \u00a7 1024.36(b) states that a servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit information requests to a servicer in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1024.36. Comment 36(b)-2 clarifies that, if a servicer establishes any such exclusive address, the servicer must provide that address to the borrower in any communication in which the servicer provides the borrower with contact information for assistance from the servicer.",

Section 1024.35(c) and comment 35(c)-2, as well as \u00a7 1024.36(b) and comment 36(b)-2, are intended to ensure that servicers inform borrowers of the correct address for the borrower to use for purposes of submitting notices of error or information requests, so that borrowers do not inadvertently send these communications to other non-designated servicer addresses (which would not provide the protections afforded by \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35 and 1024.36, respectively). If interpreted literally, the existing comments would require the servicer to include the designated address for notices of error and requests for information when <em data-original=\"E-03\">any</em> contact information, even just a phone number or web address, for the servicer is given to the borrower. The Bureau did not intend that the servicer be required to inform the borrower of the designated address in all communications with borrowers where any contact information whatsoever for the servicer is provided.",

Industry commenters supported limiting the locations where the designated address is required, but asserted that the requirement was still overbroad and unclear as to when the designated address must be provided. These commenters expressed concern that they would have to provide the designated address on every letter that included a return address or an address in the letterhead. The commenters also stated this would be unduly burdensome as it would require significant programming costs. Commenters further stated this would create problems for borrowers by causing cluttered, confusing documents leading borrowers to incorrectly send other things to the designated address (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> a borrower may send a payment to the designated address, leading to a delay in payment processing). Finally, commenters stated the proposed clarification could create conflicts with other regulations, such as the force-placed insurance letters, which include an address but do not allow additional information to be included. Industry commenters generally suggested the designated address be required only in a specific subset of contexts: the initial designation letter, the periodic statements and coupon book, the servicer's Web site, and loss mitigation documents.",

Such commenters suggested that information on the error resolution and information request rights should be included on each periodic statement."

The Bureau is further persuaded by the concern that borrowers could have been confused and incorrectly sent items that did not concern error resolution to the designated address. To require the designated address on every piece of written communication that includes a return address would be unduly burdensome and not in the best interests of the borrower. Thus, under the final rule, the designated address need be included in only a specific subset of contexts, specifically (1) the written notice, required by \u00a7 1024.35(c) and \u00a7 1024.36(b) if a servicer designates an exclusive address; (2) any periodic statement or coupon book required pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41; (3) any Web site maintained by the servicer in connection with the servicing of the loan; and (4) any notice required pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 or 1026.41 that includes contact information for assistance.",

Further, as discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of section 38(b)(5), the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3 clarifying a servicer's obligation to ensure borrowers are informed of the designated address.

The Bureau believes the requirement to resolve errors and respond to information requests should last over the same timeframe as the obligation to retain records. The Bureau believes it would be impractical to require a servicer to resolve errors and provide information at a time when Regulation X no longer requires the servicer to retain the relevant records. Conversely, the Bureau believes the servicer should be responsible to correct those records during the period when Regulation X does require a servicer to retain records, if necessary, and provide borrowers information from the records. Further, the Bureau believes the use of the term \u201cdischarged\u201d is appropriate, especially given that the term is already used in the timing of the record-retention requirement. For purposes of the Bureau's mortgage servicing rules, as opposed to bankruptcy purposes, a mortgage loan is discharged when both the debt and all corresponding liens have been extinguished or released, as applicable. The Bureau believes a borrower should have the benefit of the error resolution, information request, and record retention provisions so long as a debt <em data-original=\"E-03\">or</em> lien remains because only after both have been eliminated will there be no further possibility of a borrower needing to seek servicing information or to assert a servicing error.

                                "As discussed above in the section-by-section discussion of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.35(c) and 1024.36(b), the Bureau is amending comments 35(c)-2 and 36(b)-2 to clarify in what contexts the designated address for notices of error or requests for information must be provided. The finalized comments clarify that, if a servicer designates such an address, that address must be provided in any notice required pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 or 1024.41 that includes contact information for assistance. The Bureau notes that servicers may provide borrowers in delinquency with different addresses for different purposes. For example, a servicer may provide a borrower with the designated address for asserting errors, and a separate address for submission of loss mitigation applications. To mitigate the risk of a borrower sending a notification of error to the wrong address (and thus not triggering the associated protections), the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3.", 
                                "Section 1024.35 sets out certain procedures a servicer must follow when a borrower submits a written notice of error. These procedures provide important protections to borrowers who in are in delinquency (as well as at other times). Specifically, the procedures in \u00a7 1024.35(e)(3)(i)(B) require a servicer to take certain actions before a scheduled foreclosure sale if a borrower asserts certain errors.\n            These protections are only triggered if a borrower submits a written notice of error to the designated address (assuming the servicer has designated such an address). Thus, the Bureau believes it is important that borrowers asserting errors send the notice of error to the proper address.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that existing provisions do address ensuring the borrower is aware of the procedures required to trigger the error resolution protections. Section 1024.38(b)(5) requires a servicer to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objective of informing borrowers of the written error resolution and information request procedures. The Bureau acknowledges that a borrower in delinquency who is working with a continuity of contact representative and submitting documents related to loss mitigation may be confused about where to submit notices asserting errors. If such a borrower were to orally report the assertion of the error to the continuity of contact representative, comment 38(b)(5)-2 explains that \u00a7 1024.38(b)(s) would require servicers to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to notify a borrower who is not satisfied with the resolution of the complaint of the procedures for submitting a written notice of error. However, the Bureau is concerned that, if borrowers were to submit written assertions of an error to the addresses where they were submitting loss mitigation documents, such borrowers may believe they have properly followed the procedures, but in fact would not have triggered the protections under \u00a7 1024.35.", 
                                "To address this concern, in connection with the clarification above on the contexts in which the designated address must be provided, the Bureau is adopting new comment 38(b)(5)-3. The new comment clarifies a servicer's obligation pursuant to \u00a7 1024.38(b)(5) by stating that a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that if a borrower submits a notice of error to an incorrect address that was given to the borrower in connection with submission of a loss mitigation application or the continuity of contact pursuant to \u00a7 1024.40, the servicer will ensure the borrower is informed of the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in \u00a7 1024.35, including the correct address. Alternatively, the servicer could redirect notices of error that were sent to an incorrect address to the designated address established pursuant to \u00a7 1024.35(c)."

                                "The Bureau proposed to amend the commentary to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i) to clarify servicers' obligations with respect to providing notices to borrowers regarding the review of loss mitigation applications. Section 1024.41(b)(2)(i) requires a servicer that receives a loss mitigation application 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale to review and evaluate the application promptly and determine, based on that review, whether the application is complete or incomplete.\n            The servicer then must notify the borrower within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays) that the servicer acknowledges receipt of the application, and that the servicer has determined that the loss mitigation application is either complete or incomplete. If an application is incomplete, the notice must state the additional documents and information that the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete. In addition, servicers are obligated under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1) to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete an incomplete application, which may require, when appropriate, the servicer to contact the borrower and request such information as illustrated in comment 41(b)(1)-4.i.", 
                                "Following publication of the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from industry stakeholders requesting guidance or clarification regarding how this provision may apply in instances where a servicer determines that additional information from the borrower is needed to complete an evaluation of a loss mitigation application after either (1) the servicer has provided notice to the borrower informing the borrower that the loss mitigation application is complete, or (2) the servicer has provided notice to the borrower identifying other specific information or documentation necessary to complete the application and the borrower has furnished that documentation or information. As these stakeholders noted, servicers sometimes must collect additional information from borrowers, the need for which may not have been apparent at the point of initial application, in order to process the application and satisfy the applicable investor requirements. In these situations, a borrower may have submitted the documents and information identified in the initial notice, resulting in an application that is facially complete based on the servicer's initial review, but the servicer, upon further evaluation, determines that additional information is required to evaluate the borrower for a loss mitigation option pursuant to requirements imposed by an investor or guarantor of a mortgage.", 
                                "The Bureau proposed additional commentary to address these concerns. As the Bureau explained in the June 2013 Proposal, the notice required by \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) is intended to provide the borrower with timely notification that a loss mitigation application was received and either is considered complete by the servicer or is considered incomplete and that the borrower is required to take further action for the servicer to evaluate the loss mitigation application. The Bureau was conscious of concerns that servicers have unnecessarily prolonged loss mitigation processes by incomplete and inadequate document reviews that lead to repeated requests for supplemental information that reasonably could have been requested initially, and so the Bureau designed the rule to ensure an adequate up-front review. At the same time, the Bureau did not believe it would be in the best interest of borrowers or servicers to create a system that leads to borrower applications being denied solely because they contain inadequate information and the servicer believes it may not request the additional information needed.", 
                                "The Bureau therefore proposed three provisions to address these concerns. First, the Bureau proposed new comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-1, which would have clarified that, notwithstanding that a servicer has informed a borrower that an application is complete (or notified the borrower of specific information necessary to complete an incomplete application), a servicer must request additional information from a borrower if the servicer determines, in the course of evaluating the loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower, that additional information is required.", 
                                "Second, the Bureau proposed new comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2, which would have clarified that, except as provided in \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) (the Bureau's third proposed new provision, discussed below), the protections triggered by a complete loss mitigation application in \u00a7 1024.41 would not be triggered by an incomplete application. An application would have been considered complete only when a servicer has received all the information the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower, even if an inaccurate \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice had been sent to the borrower. The Bureau noted that the proposed clarifications would not have allowed servicers deliberately to inform borrowers that incomplete applications are complete or to describe the information necessary to complete an application as something less than all of the necessary information. Servicers are required under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(A) to review a loss mitigation application to determine whether it is complete or incomplete. In addition, servicers are subject to the \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(iv) requirement to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the objectives of identifying documents and information that a borrower is required to submit to complete an otherwise incomplete loss mitigation application, and servicers are obligated under \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1) to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to complete an incomplete application. Thus, the proposed clarifications were intended to address situations where servicers make bona fide mistakes in initially evaluating loss mitigation applications.", 
                                "Third, as described more fully below, the Bureau proposed new \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) to require that, if a servicer creates a reasonable expectation that a loss mitigation application is complete, but later discovers information is missing, the servicer must treat the application as complete for certain purposes until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the loss mitigation application. The Bureau believed the proposed rule would mitigate potential risks to consumers that could arise through a loss mitigation process prolonged by incomplete and inadequate document reviews and repeated requests for supplemental information. The Bureau believed these new provisions would provide a mechanism for servicers to correct bona fide mistakes in conducting up-front reviews of loss mitigation applications for completeness, while ensuring that borrowers do not lose the protections under the rule due to such mistakes and that servicers have incentives to conduct rigorous up-front review of loss mitigation applications."

Commenters were generally supportive of the Bureau addressing situations where a servicer later discovers additional information is required to evaluate an application that is complete according to the terms of the notice the servicer sent the borrower. Commenters generally agreed that a strict rule that prevents servicers from seeking additional information when needed would result in unnecessary denials of loss mitigation to the borrower and that encouraging communication from the servicer to the borrower will improve loss mitigation procedures for the borrower. However, some commenters expressed the view that the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules were sufficient in this regard and that revisions at a date so close to implementation are counterproductive to institutions trying to implement the rule."

The Bureau believes, as it suggested in the proposal, that there is little value in requiring a servicer to evaluate a loss mitigation application when the servicer has determined certain items of information are missing. The Bureau is therefore adopting comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-1, which clarifies that if, a servicer determines, in the course of evaluating the loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower, that additional information is required, the servicer must promptly request the additional information from the borrower. The comment also references \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), a new provision that sets forth requirements and procedures for a servicer to follow in the event that a facially complete application is later found by the servicer to require additional information or documentation to be evaluated. See the discussion of \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) in the section-by-section analysis below.", 
                                "The Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2, which would have provided that protections triggered by a \u201ccomplete\u201d loss mitigation application would not be triggered by a facially complete application\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> where the servicer informs the borrower that the application is complete, or the borrower provides all the documents and information specified by the servicer in the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice as needed to render the application complete. The Bureau continues to believe that certain protections must be provided to borrowers who have submitted all the missing documents and information requested in the 1026.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, even if a servicer later determines additional information is necessary. However, the Bureau has been persuaded by commenters that argued a borrower who submits all the documents requested in the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice (if any) should receive the protection the rule affords to borrowers at the time the borrower submits those documents. In accordance with this approach, proposed comment 41(b)(2)(i)(B)-2 has not been finalized."

Section 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) requires a servicer to provide in the notice required pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) the earliest remaining of four specific dates set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii). The four dates set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) are: (1) The date by which any document or information submitted by a borrower will be considered stale or invalid pursuant to any requirements applicable to any loss mitigation option available to the borrower; (2) the date that is the 120th day of the borrower's delinquency; (3) the date that is 90 days before a foreclosure sale; and (4) the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale.", 
                                "In general, many of the protections afforded to a borrower by \u00a7 1024.41 are dependent on a borrower submitting a complete loss mitigation application a certain amount of time before a foreclosure sale. The later a borrower submits a complete application, and the closer in time to a foreclosure sale, the fewer protections the borrower receives under \u00a7 1024.41. It is therefore in the interest of borrowers to complete loss mitigation applications as early in the delinquency and foreclosure process as possible. However, even if a borrower does not complete a loss mitigation application sufficiently early in the process to secure <em data-original=\"E-03\">all</em> the protections possibly available under &#167; 1024.41, that borrower may still benefit from some of the protections afforded. Borrowers should not be discouraged from completing loss mitigation applications merely because they cannot complete a loss mitigation application by the date that would be most advantageous in terms of securing the protections available under &#167; 1024.41. Accordingly, the goal of &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) is to inform borrowers of the time by which they should complete their loss mitigation applications to receive the greatest set of protections available, without discouraging later efforts if the borrower does not complete the loss mitigation application by the suggested date. The Bureau notes &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) requires servicers to inform borrowers of the date by which the borrower <em data-original=\"E-03\">should</em> make the loss mitigation application complete, as opposed to the date by which the borrower <em data-original=\"E-03\">must</em> make the loss mitigation application complete.", 
                                "The Bureau believed, based on communications with consumer advocates, servicers, and trade associations, that the requirement in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) may be overly prescriptive and may prevent a servicer from having the flexibility to suggest an appropriate date by which a borrower should complete a loss mitigation application. For example, if a borrower submits a loss mitigation application on the 114th day of delinquency, the servicer would have to inform him or her by the 119th day that the borrower should complete the loss mitigation application by the 120th day under the current provision. A borrower is unlikely to be able to assemble the missing information within one day, and would be better served by being advised to complete the loss mitigation application by a reasonable later date that would afford the borrower most of the benefits of the rule as well as enough time to gather the information.", 
                                "In response to these concerns, and in accordance with the goals of the provision, the Bureau proposed to amend the requirement in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii). Specifically, the Bureau proposed to replace the requirement that a servicer disclose the earliest remaining date of the four specific dates set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) with a more flexible requirement that a servicer determine and disclose a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the documents and information necessary to make the loss mitigation application complete. The Bureau proposed to clarify this amendment in proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1, which would have explained that, in determining a reasonable date, a servicer should select the deadline that preserves the maximum borrower rights under \u00a7 1024.41, except when doing so would be impracticable. Proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 would have clarified further that a servicer should consider the four deadlines previously set forth in \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) as factors in selecting a reasonable date. Proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 also would have clarified that if a foreclosure sale is not scheduled, for the purposes of determining a reasonable date, a servicer may make a reasonable estimate of when a foreclosure sale may be scheduled. This proposal was intended to provide appropriate flexibility while also requiring that servicers consider the impact of the various times, and the associated protections, set forth in \u00a7 1024.41."

                                "The Bureau received comments from industry as well as consumer groups addressing these proposed provisions. Industry commenters appreciated the extra flexibility offered by the proposal, but expressed concern about the complexity of selecting a date. Such commenters noted that different servicers might have different estimates of what should be a reasonable time for otherwise similarly situated borrowers, and differences in state law might also cause two apparently similar borrowers to receive different notices. Additionally, these commenters expressed concern that ambiguity in what is \u201cpractical\u201d increases the risk of litigation. These commenters suggested either a simpler rule, under which the application should be complete by the earlier of 30 days after the borrower submitted the incomplete application or the 38th day before a scheduled foreclosure sale (an approach taken by HAMP), or that the Bureau provide additional guidance for determining what is impractical. Finally, commenters expressed concern about borrower confusion, stating that borrowers will not understand the significance of the various dates.", 
                                "Consumer groups expressed concern that if servicers have discretion about how to inform borrowers when they should complete their applications, servicers will misguide borrowers and cause them to complete applications too late to receive all the protections that could have been available under the rule. Additionally, some consumer groups expressed the view that this whole issue would be avoided if the loss mitigation protections were triggered by an initial application package, defined as a specific subset of documents required for loss mitigation, rather than a complete loss mitigation application."

                                "The Bureau is amending the text of \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) to require that the related notice must include a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the missing information. Additionally, the Bureau is adopting an revised version of proposed comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 to clarify what is a reasonable date to include in a notice sent pursuant to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B). Similar to the proposal, final comment 41(b)(2)(ii)-1 states that, in determining a reasonable date, a servicer should select the date that preserves the maximum borrower rights possible under \u00a7 1024.41 (and provides the four milestones originally in the regulation text), except when doing so would be impracticable to permit the borrower sufficient time to obtain and submit the type of documentation needed. The final comment has been amended to state further that, generally, it would be impracticable for a borrower to obtain and submit documents in less than seven days.", 
                                "As discussed in the proposed rule, the Bureau has structured this provision so that borrowers receive information that encourages them to submit a complete application in time to receive the most protections possible under the rule, while not discouraging borrowers who miss this time from later submitting an application to receive a subset of the protections. Because some of the protections are triggered by the submission of a complete loss mitigation application when a certain amount of time remains before a scheduled foreclosure sale, the protections decrease the later a borrower submits an application. Thus, the Bureau declines to adopt a rule that simply suggests the borrower complete the application within 30 days because such a rule will not meet the intended purposes of the provision.", 
                                "The Bureau also understands that a borrower may not understand the significance of certain milestones, and may be confused if presented by a list of different dates. This is the very reason the rule requires the servicer to provide a single date by which the borrower should complete the application\u2014it removes the burden from the borrower of calculating the different timelines and attempting to determine by when they should complete their application.", 
                                "The Bureau does appreciate the challenges of determining what would be impracticable, thus the Bureau has added language to the commentary explaining that generally it would be impracticable for a borrower to obtain and submit documents in less than seven days. The Bureau notes this is a minimum number of days, and that a servicer may extend this timeline if it believes the borrower would need more time to gather the information. The Bureau believes this approach gives servicers guidance as to what is impracticable, while allowing some flexibility for servicers to address situations where additional time would be required for the borrower to submit particular types of missing information.", 
                                "Finally, while the final rule does not permit servicers to estimate foreclosure sale dates in other contexts, such as for purposes of determining whether a borrower will be granted an appeal right when no foreclosure sale has actually been scheduled, the Bureau believes it appropriate to allow servicers to estimate a foreclosure sale date for the narrow purpose of this provision. The Bureau notes that servicers may have information about when a foreclosure sale is likely to be scheduled and that allowing a servicer to use this information in determining the time by which a borrower should complete the application would provide the most useful date for borrowers. Thus, the Bureau includes this provision in the comment adopted by this final rule.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that some consumer groups suggested loss mitigation protections should be triggered by an initial application package, defined as a specific subset of documents required for loss mitigation, rather than a complete loss mitigation application. The Bureau notes that while such an approach has been used in other loss mitigation programs, such a modification to the loss mitigation provisions of \u00a7 1024.41 is beyond the scope of the proposed changes to the rule."

                                "The Bureau proposed to add new \u00a7 1024.41(b)(3) addressing the borrowers' rights in situations in which no foreclosure sale has been scheduled as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received, or a previously scheduled foreclosure sale is rescheduled after receipt of a complete application. As discussed in the proposal, \u00a7 1024.41 is structured to provide different procedural rights to borrowers and impose different requirements on servicers depending on the number of days remaining until a foreclosure sale is scheduled to occur, as of the time that a complete loss mitigation application is received. However, the provisions of \u00a7 1024.41 do not expressly address situations in which a foreclosure sale has not yet been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received, or is rescheduled after the application is received. Since issuance of the final rule, the Bureau has received questions about the applicability of the timing provisions in such situations. Specifically, industry stakeholders have asked whether it is appropriate to use estimated dates of foreclosure where a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received. Further, industry stakeholders have requested guidance on how to apply the timelines if no foreclosure is scheduled as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received, but a foreclosure sale is subsequently scheduled less than 90 days after receipt of such application, or if a foreclosure sale has been scheduled for less than 90 days after a complete application is received, but is then postponed to a date that is 90 days or more after the receipt date.", 
                                "The Bureau proposed new \u00a7 1024.41(b)(3), which stated that, for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41, timelines based on the proximity of a foreclosure sale to the receipt of a complete loss mitigation application will be determined as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received. Proposed comment 41(b)(3)-1 would have clarified that if a foreclosure sale has not yet been scheduled as of the date that a complete loss mitigation application is received, the application shall be treated as if it were received at least 90 days before a foreclosure sale. Proposed comment 41(b)(3)-2 would have clarified that such timelines would remain in effect even if at a later date a foreclosure sale was rescheduled.", 
                                "The Bureau believed this approach would provide certainty to both servicers and borrowers as well as ensure that borrowers receive the broadest protections available under the rule in situations in which a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application. In the proposal, the Bureau also discussed alternative modifications to the rule, which the Bureau declined to propose, including having the applicable timelines vary depending on the newly scheduled (or re-scheduled) sale date, or allowing servicers to estimate when a foreclosure sale might be scheduled. On balance, the Bureau believed that a straightforward rule under which the protections that attach are determined as of the date of receipt of a complete loss mitigation application, and a complete loss mitigation application is treated as having been received 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale if no sale is scheduled as of the date the application is received, is preferable because it would provide industry and borrowers with clarity regarding its application, without the unnecessary complexity that other approaches might produce. The Bureau recognized that the proposed rule might in some cases require a servicer to delay a foreclosure sale to allow the specified time for the borrower to respond to a loss mitigation offer and to appeal the servicer's denial of a loan modification option, where applicable, and sought comment and supporting data regarding circumstances in which this may occur."

Overall, commenters appreciated the clarity and simplicity of the proposed rule. They supported the idea that borrower protection should be clear and certain. One consumer advocate expressed concern that the rule limits, but does not eliminate, dual tracking. This commenter was concerned that a sale may be scheduled with less than 37 days' notice. Another consumer advocate suggested the rule should always adopt the most consumer-friendly timeline. That is, if a sale is postponed, a borrower should receive the benefit of any extra protections that might arise given a longer time between the sale and the submission of a complete application; but if a sale is scheduled to occur on a short timeline, the borrower should not lose the original protections that had attached on the basis of the longer timeline.", 
                                "Industry commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of the proposed rule. Such commenters were concerned this may inappropriately extend the timeline of a foreclosure sale. These commenters urged the Bureau to limit the appeal right to when a complete application is submitted within 30 days of the first notice or filing required for a foreclosure sale. Alternatively, some commenters urged the Bureau to allow servicers to estimate when a foreclosure sale may occur. For example, one commenter suggested such estimates could be based on estimates provided by nationally recognized sources. Finally, industry commenters expressed concern the proposed provision may not be feasible because a servicer may be unable to move a scheduled foreclosure sale. One commenter recommended the Bureau offer an exemption from liability when an investor or court requires a servicer to continue with a foreclosure sale in violation of the applicable timelines."

For the reasons discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes the final rule appropriately balances consumer protection and servicer needs. This approach provides certainty to both servicers and borrowers, as well as ensures that borrowers receive the broadest protections available under the rule in situations where a foreclosure sale has not been scheduled at the time a complete loss mitigation application is received.", 
                                "The Bureau declines to adopt other approaches suggested in comments. The Bureau notes that structuring the rule such that a borrower's rights may be added or removed because a foreclosure sale was moved or rescheduled would not provide the certainty or simplicity created by the proposed rule. Further, the Bureau is concerned that if moving a foreclosure sale to a later date could trigger new protections, such a policy may provide a disincentive for a servicer to reschedule a foreclosure sale for a later date. Finally, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to limit the appeal rights to when a complete application is submitted within 30 days of the first notice or filing, because, regardless of when a first notice or filing is made, a servicer should be able to provide a borrower an appeal when there is sufficient time before the scheduled foreclosure sale.", 
                                "The Bureau does not believe that the rule being finalized, which grants the borrower certain rights if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application before a sale has been scheduled, will cause inappropriate delays in the foreclosure process. First, while some States may schedule foreclosure sales to occur in less than 90 days of the scheduling of the sale, completing the process of reviewing a loss mitigation application may not necessitate a delay in the scheduled sale. For example, if the scheduling of a sale occurs 30 days after a complete loss mitigation application is submitted, and the sale is scheduled for 60 days after the scheduling occurs, the servicer will have sufficient time to follow the complete loss mitigation procedures without having to move the foreclosure sale. Second, servicers control many of the timelines in the process, including the 30-day evaluation window, and the time to process an appeal. If a foreclosure sale is rescheduled to occur in less than 90 days after a borrower submitted a complete application, a servicer does have the option to review the application quickly and, in doing so, the servicer may avoid the need to postpone the foreclosure sale.", 
                                "In situations where there is a conflict (a later scheduled foreclosure sale that does not allow a servicer or borrower sufficient time to complete the procedures required by the loss mitigation rules), the Bureau expects a servicer to take the necessary steps to avoid having the foreclosure sale occur before the loss mitigation review procedures run their course, including asking a court to move a scheduled foreclosure sale, if necessary. An important objective of the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules is to ensure that loss mitigation applications receive careful review, so that a servicer does not foreclose on a borrower who would have qualified for a loss mitigation option and who timely submitted a complete application for loss mitigation. Consistent with that objective, once a borrower has submitted an application, a servicer should carry out the procedures prescribed by the rule in light of the timing and content of the application. To permit a later scheduled (or rescheduled) foreclosure sale to cut short those procedures would be inconsistent with the objective just described. For these reasons, the Bureau finalizes the rule substantially as proposed, with minor wording changes."

In adopting the 2013 Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, the Bureau crafted broad definitions of \u201closs mitigation option\u201d and \u201closs mitigation application\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41, to provide a streamlined process in which a borrower will be evaluated for all available loss mitigation options at the same time, rather than having to apply multiple times to be evaluated for different options one at a time. Since publication of the final rule, however, both industry and consumer advocates have raised questions and concerns about how the rule applies in situations in which a borrower needs and requests only short-term forbearance. For instance, a number of servicers have inquired about whether the rule would prevent them from granting a borrower's request for waiver of late fees or other short-term relief after a natural disaster until the borrower submits all information necessary for evaluation of the borrower for long-term loss mitigation options. Additionally, both consumer advocates and servicers have raised questions about whether a borrower's request for short-term relief would later preclude a borrower from invoking the protections afforded by the rule if the borrower encounters a significant change in circumstances that warrants long-term loss mitigation alternatives.", 
                                "The Bureau was conscious of the difficulties involved in distinguishing short-term forbearance programs from other types of loss mitigation and of the concern that some servicers may have significantly exacerbated borrowers' financial difficulties by using short-term forbearance programs inappropriately instead of reviewing the borrowers for long-term options. Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that it was possible to revise the rule to facilitate appropriate use of short-term payment forbearance programs without creating undue risk for borrowers who need to be evaluated for a full range of loss mitigation alternatives.", 
                                "At the outset, the Bureau noted that it does not construe the existing rule to require that servicers obtain a complete loss mitigation application prior to exercising their discretion to waive late fees. Additionally the Bureau noted that, under the rule as adopted, a servicer may offer any borrower any loss mitigation option if the borrower has not submitted a loss mitigation application or if the offer is not based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, as clarified in existing comment 41(c)(2)(i)-1.", 
                                "With regard to short-term forbearance programs that involve more than simply waiving late fees, such as where a servicer allows a borrower to forgo making a certain number of payments and then to catch up by spreading the unpaid amounts over some subsequent period of time, the Bureau believed that the issues raised by various stakeholders could most appropriately be addressed by providing more flexibility to servicers to provide such relief even if it is based on review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. Thus, the Bureau did not propose to change the current definition of loss mitigation option, which includes all forbearance programs. Rather, the Bureau proposed to relax the anti-evasion restriction in \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(i), which prohibits a servicer from offering a loss mitigation option based upon an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application.", 
                                "The Bureau thus proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), which would have allowed short-term payment forbearance programs to be offered based on a review of an incomplete loss mitigation application. The proposed exemption would have applied only to short-term payment forbearance programs. Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-1 stated that a payment forbearance program is a loss mitigation option for which a servicer allows a borrower to forgo making certain payments for a period of time. Short-term payment forbearance programs may be offered when a borrower is having a short-term difficulty brought on, for example, by a natural disaster. In such cases, the servicer offers a short-term payment forbearance arrangement to assist the borrower in managing the hardship. The Bureau explained that, in its view, it is appropriate for servicers to have the flexibility to offer short-term payment forbearance programs prior to receiving a complete loss mitigation application for all available loss mitigation options. Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-1 also would have explained that a short-term program is one that allows the forbearance of payments due over periods of up to two months.", 
                                "The Bureau noted that, under the proposed approach, servicers that receive a request for short-term payment forbearance and grant such requests would remain subject to the requirements triggered by the receipt of a loss mitigation application in \u00a7 1024.41. Thus, as explained in proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-2, if a servicer offers a payment forbearance program based on an incomplete loss mitigation application, the servicer still would be required to review the application for completeness, to send the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice to inform the borrower whether the application is complete or incomplete, and if incomplete what documents or additional information are required, and to use reasonable diligence to complete the loss mitigation application. If a borrower in this situation submits a complete application, the servicer must evaluate it for all available loss mitigation options. The Bureau believed that maintaining these requirements is important to ensure that borrowers are not inappropriately diverted into short-term forbearance programs without access to the full protections of the regulation. At the same time, if a borrower in fact does not want an evaluation for long-term options, the borrower may simply refrain from providing the additional information necessary to submit a complete application and the servicer will therefore not be required to conduct a full assessment for all options.", 
                                "To ensure that a borrower who is receiving an offer of short-term payment forbearance understands the options available, proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) would have required a servicer offering a short-term payment forbearance program to a borrower based on an incomplete loss mitigation application to include in the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice additional information, specifically that: (1) The servicer has received an incomplete loss mitigation application and on the basis of that application the servicer is offering a short-term payment forbearance program; (2) absent further action by the borrower, the servicer will not be reviewing the incomplete application for other loss mitigation options; and (3) if the borrower would like to be considered for other loss mitigation options, he or she must submit the missing documents and information required to complete the loss mitigation application. The Bureau believed that providing borrowers this more specific information is important to ensure that borrowers do not face unwarranted delays and paperwork and that servicers do not misuse short-term forbearance to avoid addressing long-term problems.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-3 to clarify servicers' obligations on receipt of a complete loss mitigation application. The proposed comment would have stated that, notwithstanding that a servicer may have offered a borrower a payment forbearance program after an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, and even if the borrower accepted the payment forbearance offer, a servicer must still comply with all requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 on receipt of a borrower's submission of a complete loss mitigation application. This proposed comment was intended to clarify that, even though payment forbearance may be offered as short-term assistance to a borrower, a borrower is still entitled to submit a complete loss mitigation application and receive an evaluation of such application for all available loss mitigation options. Although payment forbearance may assist a borrower with a short-term hardship, a borrower should not be precluded from demonstrating a long-term inability to afford the original mortgage, and being considered for long-term solutions, such as a loan modification, when that may be appropriate."

                                "The Bureau received comments from both industry and consumer group commenters on this provision. Commenters were generally very supportive of allowing an exclusion from the full loss mitigation procedures for short-term problems, that is, problems that can be quickly resolved (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> a borrower needed new tires for his or her car and thus falls a month behind on mortgage payments). They asserted that short-term problems are better resolved quickly and that the full loss mitigation procedures should apply only to consumers with long-term problems. One industry commenter stated that the paperwork of the full procedures would be seen as burdensome when a borrower had a short-term problem, and this would be perceived as poor customer service. Additionally, commenters pointed out that, under &#167; 1024.41(i), a borrower is entitled to the full procedures for only a single complete loss mitigation application, and it would not be in the borrower's best interest to &#8220;waste&#8221; that single evaluation under the full procedures on a simple, short-term problem. Consumer advocate commenters suggested that borrowers should be warned before they use their single evaluation.", 
                                "Both consumer advocate and industry commenters expressed concern that the two-month forbearance contemplated by the proposed rule was too brief. Such commenters urged the Bureau to permit payment forbearances of as long as six months or a year, to allow borrowers the opportunity to resolve their problems (for example, attempting to find a new job) before using up their opportunities to be evaluated for long-term options, such as a loan modification. Further, commenters expressed that the industry standard for payment forbearance programs was longer than two months\u2014often six months or even a year. Finally, commenters expressed that short-term forbearances were particularly important for addressing two situations, unemployment and natural disasters."

However, in light of comments received, the Bureau has made some adjustments to the proposed provisions. As discussed below, the Bureau is clarifying the servicer's reasonable diligence obligation when a borrower has been offered a payment forbearance based on evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, and the Bureau has adjusted the limit on the length of payment forbearances that would be allowed under this provision.",

The Bureau continues to believe this exclusion is appropriate, because it should provide servicers greater flexibility to address short-term problems quickly and efficiently. Further, because the exclusion applies to decisions based on review of incomplete loss mitigation applications, it will allow the borrower's short-term problems to be addressed while preserving a borrower's single use of the full &#167; 1024.41 loss mitigation procedures.", 
                                "The Bureau declines to exclude payment forbearance from the definition of loss mitigation. The final rule provides the same benefits in flexibility that would be achieved by revising the definition of loss mitigation while preserving important consumer protections. If a borrower requests payment forbearance, he or she should be regarded as having requested loss mitigation under the terms of \u00a7 1024.41, and the procedures generally required by the rule should take place. Further, the Bureau notes that a borrower always has the option of completing his or her loss mitigation application and receiving a full evaluation for all options. This is reflected in comment 41(c)(2)(iii)-3, which states that even if a servicer offers a borrower a payment forbearance program after an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, the servicer must still comply with all other requirements in \u00a7 1024.41 if the borrower completes his or her loss mitigation application.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that the new provision addresses only payment forbearance that is offered based on an evaluation of an incomplete application. The Bureau is aware, as some commenters noted, that situations may arise where a borrower completes a loss mitigation application and goes through a full loss mitigation evaluation, and the end result is the borrower being offered a payment forbearance\u2014which would exhaust his or her single use of the \u00a7 1024.41 loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau notes that some consumer advocates asked the Bureau to exempt any such loss mitigation evaluation from the successive request provision in \u00a7 1024.41(i), or require that such borrowers be warned so they know not to complete their application if they are seeking only payment forbearance.", 
                                "While the Bureau acknowledges these concerns, the Bureau notes that the proposal was limited to discussing payment forbearance based on <em data-original=\"E-03\">incomplete</em> applications, and comments addressing payment forbearance based on <em data-original=\"E-03\">complete</em> applications are beyond the scope of the proposed rule. Further, the Bureau notes that the loss mitigation rules are intended to address only procedures, and leave the substantive decisions on different loss mitigation programs to the discretion of the owner or assignee. Finally, the Bureau notes that any issues related to the second or successive request provision in &#167; 1024.41(i) would more appropriately be addressed in a rulemaking focusing on that provision.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Payment forbearance and reasonable diligence.</em> The proposed provision on payment forbearance included a modification to the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, which would have required the notice to include additional information when a servicer was offering a borrower payment forbearance based on an incomplete application. While the Bureau believes it is important for borrowers to be informed that they are being offered payment forbearance based on an incomplete loss mitigation application and they may receive a full review for all other options by completing their applications, the Bureau believes that servicers should have flexibility to provide this message at the appropriate time. A servicer may, in some circumstances, need to communicate additional information regarding payment forbearance. For example, a servicer may require additional information&#8212;short of a complete loss mitigation application&#8212;to offer a borrower a payment forbearance program. Further, the Bureau acknowledges that a servicer may decide to offer a borrower payment forbearance at various stages of the loss mitigation process, and the message should be provided at the appropriate time. For example, if a servicer needs additional information before offering payment forbearance, the servicer might not decide to offer a borrower payment forbearance until after the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice has been sent out. In light of these considerations, the Bureau declines to finalize the provision regarding modification of the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice in the context of payment forbearance. Instead, the Bureau has amended comment 41(b)(1)-4, added paragraph 4.iii, which addresses a servicer's reasonable diligence obligations. The comment explains that, when a servicer offers a borrower payment forbearance based on an incomplete application, the servicer should notify the borrower that the borrower may complete the application to receive a full evaluation of all loss mitigation options available to the borrower.", 
                                "The Bureau believes a servicer's diligence obligations may vary depending on the facts and circumstances. In some instances, it may be appropriate for servicers to include this additional information in the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. For example, if a servicer decides to offer a borrower payment forbearance based on the initial submission that establishes the loss mitigation application (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> the borrower calls the servicer and, on the basis of that call, the servicer decides to offer the borrower payment forbearance), the servicer might include the message (that the borrower is being offered payment forbearance but may complete the application to receive a full evaluation) in the &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, along with the full list of information and documents necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. Alternatively, if the servicer wanted to offer the borrower a payment forbearance program, but needed a few additional documents to do so, the servicer might send a &#167; 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice explaining that the borrower has the option of submitting a few items and receiving payment forbearance, or submitting all the missing information and receiving a full evaluation. If the borrower submitted only the items for the payment forbearance and the servicer offered the borrower a payment forbearance program, at that time the servicer could to notify the borrower that he or she has the option of completing the application.", 
                                "Conversely, if the servicer does not decide to offer a payment forbearance program based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application until after the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice has been sent, the servicer would still have the option of offering the borrower payment forbearance at that later time. The servicer would notify the borrower that he or she has the option of completing the application at the time the servicer offered the payment forbearance program.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau is adding a new subpart to comment 41(b)(1)-4 to further elaborate on the servicer's reasonable diligence obligation when a borrower is considered for short-term forbearance under this provision. Once a borrower has begun a payment forbearance program, the Bureau believes the servicer need not continue to request missing items from the borrower during the course of the payment forbearance program, unless the borrower fails to comply with the payment forbearance program or the borrower indicates he or she would like to continue completing the application. Thus, comment 41(b)(1)-4.iii states that, once a servicer provides this notification, the servicer could suspend reasonable diligence efforts until near the end of the payment forbearance program, so long as the borrower remains in compliance with the payment forbearance program and does not request any further assistance.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau believes that, unless the borrower has brought his or her loan current, it may be necessary for the servicer to contact the borrower prior to the end of the forbearance period to determine if the borrower wishes to complete the application and proceed with a full loss mitigation evaluation. Thus, comment 41(b)(1)-4.iii states that near the end of the program, and prior to the end of the forbearance period, it may be necessary for the servicer to contact the borrower to determine if the borrower wishes to complete the application and proceed with a full loss mitigation evaluation.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Length of payment forbearance.</em> The Bureau is amending the proposed interpretation of &#8220;short-term&#8221; forbearance, in light of public comments that supported the general exception, but suggested that an exception permitting only two-month forbearances would be of limited benefit to borrowers and servicers. The Bureau is persuaded that a two-month payment forbearance window may not allow the borrower sufficient time to remedy even some short-term problems. As adopted, comment 41(b)(2)(iii)-1 explains that &#8220;short-term&#8221; forbearance means a program that allows the forbearance of payments due over periods of no more than six months, as opposed to two months. The Bureau notes that this six-month period may cover time both before and after the payment forbearance was granted (for example, if a borrower is one month delinquent when a servicer offers a payment forbearance program, the program may only extend 5 months into the future). The Bureau believes the extended timeline allows the servicer sufficient flexibility to address most short-term situations.", 
                                "As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau was concerned that, if a servicer offered a borrower a payment forbearance of more than two months, the borrower may lose the benefit of the 120-day foreclosure referral prohibition in \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1), because the 120 days may run out during the course of the forbearance plan. The Bureau believes that, as part of a payment forbearance program as contemplated by this rule, a servicer should not foreclose on a borrower who is complying with the payment forbearance program. To make explicit that this restriction is an aspect of the payment forbearance programs permissible under the new provision, the Bureau has added a foreclosure protection clause to the payment forbearance provision in \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iii).", 
                                "The Bureau received comments requesting longer payment forbearance programs and noting that existing programs that may be offered through HUD or HAMP, or by the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (collectively \u201cGSEs\u201d), may offer payment forbearance for periods extending beyond six months to a year, particularly in situations such as natural disaster or unemployment. The Bureau remains convinced that, if a borrower has a long-term problem, such a borrower should, if the borrower chooses, receive a full evaluation for all loss mitigation options. Because forbearance programs under \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) should only be used for temporary problems, the Bureau believes it is important to reassess a borrower's situation after no more than six months.", 
                                "However, the new rule does not preclude a servicer from offering multiple successive short-term payment forbearance programs. As discussed below in the Section 1022(b)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act analysis, the Bureau has sought to ensure that borrowers would receive significant benefits from the additional option without losing protections provided by \u00a7 1024.41. Commenters strongly felt that a short forbearance period would not provide much additional benefit to borrowers, and further explained that a payment forbearance of less than a year may interfere with existing programs under HUD, HAMP, and the GSEs. The Bureau acknowledges that a borrower will generate a significant unpaid debt over the course of a long forbearance period. However, the Bureau notes that a borrower who believes the circumstances warrant cutting a long forbearance short can receive a full review for all loss available mitigation options by submitting a complete loss mitigation application. In addition, the Bureau believes that the risk servicers would attempt to evade the full loss mitigation procedures by offering sequential six-month forbearances to delinquent borrowers is low. Thus, the Bureau believes that borrowers benefit more from renewable forbearance agreements than they would benefit from any limit the Bureau might impose at this time on the maximum number of forbearances. The Bureau notes, however, that while the final rule does not prohibit a servicer from offering multiple short-term forbearances under this provision, the Bureau intends to monitor how temporary forbearances are used after this final rule becomes effective and, if it determines servicers are inappropriately offering sequential payment forbearances, may address the issue in a later rulemaking or by other means at a later date."

This provision was designed to work together with proposed new comments 41(b)(2)(i)-1 and -2, as discussed above, to address situations when a servicer determines that an application the servicer previously determined to be complete (or to be missing particular information) is in fact is lacking additional information needed for evaluation.",

As discussed above, the Bureau recognizes that, in certain circumstances, an application may appear to be complete (or to be missing only specific information), but the servicer, upon further evaluation, may determine that additional information is needed before the servicer can evaluate the borrower for all available loss mitigation options. The proposed commentary to \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i) was intended to clarify that servicers are required to obtain the missing information in such situations. Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) was intended to protect borrowers while a servicer requests the missing information.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-1 would have clarified that a reasonable expectation is created when the borrower submits all the missing items (if any) identified in the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. When a reasonable expectation that a loss mitigation application is complete is created but the servicer later discovers that the application is incomplete, proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) would have provided that the servicer shall treat the application as complete for certain purposes until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to supply the missing information necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. Specifically, under this provision, the servicer would need to treat the application as complete for purposes of the foreclosure referral prohibition in \u00a7 1024.41(f)(2) and the foreclosure sale limitations in \u00a7 1024.41(g). Proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) would have ensured that servicers that made bona fide mistakes in making initial determinations of completeness need not be considered in violation of the rule, and that borrowers do not lose protections under the rule due to such mistakes. The Bureau believed that, once a borrower is given reason to believe he or she has the benefit of certain protections (which are triggered by submission of a complete loss mitigation application), if the servicer discovers that an application is incomplete, the borrower should have a reasonable opportunity to complete the application before losing the benefit of such protections.", 
                                "Proposed comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-2 would have provided guidance on what would be a reasonable opportunity for the borrower to complete a loss mitigation application. The comment states that a reasonable opportunity requires that the borrower be notified of what information is missing and be given sufficient time to gather the information and submit it to the servicer. The amount of time that is sufficient for this purpose would depend on the facts and circumstances.",

Further, servicers seeking relief under the provision need only give borrowers a reasonable opportunity to provide the missing information, thus allowing a servicer to continue the foreclosure process if a borrower does not provide such information."

                                "As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i), the Bureau received comments from industry as well a consumer groups addressing these proposed provisions. Commenters were generally supportive of the Bureau addressing situations where a servicer later discovers additional documents or information are required to complete a loss mitigation application. However, commenters sought additional clarification on several aspects of the proposed amendment. First, commenters sought clarification on when a borrower's rights or protections are triggered. Commenters also expressed concern that it was unclear when a reasonable expectation had been created. For example, one commenter stated that a servicer may argue a homeowner had no reasonable expectation even if a complete application was submitted. Second, commenters sought clarification as to what would be considered a reasonable amount of time for a borrower to complete an application. Commenters suggested a set number of days should be given. Finally, commenters asked what happens after the missing information is provided or a reasonable time passes and the borrower fails to provide the information. Some commenters stated that the application should be considered complete only as of the date the missing information was provided and the application was actually completed. Other commenters stated the application should be treated as if it were complete when the reasonable expectation was created. One commenter pointed out that the expectation should be created based on the borrower's action (submitting the items requested in the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice), rather than on an action (or inaction) of the servicer. As this commenter noted, if a borrower initially submits a complete application, the related protections of the rule should be triggered when the borrower submits the application, not when the servicer sends the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. Therefore, this commenter asserted, if a borrower is asked to provide certain items, the protections should be triggered when those items are provided, not when the servicer deems the application to be complete. Finally, some commenters suggested the proposed revisions should go further and require a confirmation notice, as well as provide additional guidance on the timing and content of that notice. For example, one commenter suggested that servicers should be required to explain the reason a particular document does not meet underwriting guidelines, rather than simply requesting the document again."

                                "The Bureau is adopting a final version of \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) that is similar to the proposed version, but with some modifications. First, the Bureau is not including the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d standard set forth in the proposal. Instead, the provision as adopted states that, if a borrower submits all the missing information listed in the notice required pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(b)(2)(i)(B), or if no additional information is requested in such notice, the application shall be considered \u201cfacially complete\u201d and will trigger certain borrower protections. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes the subjective nature of the term \u201creasonable expectation\u201d could have resulted in unnecessary compliance challenges and confusion as to when a reasonable expectation had been established. The Bureau believes the concept of facial completeness, on the other hand, provides greater clarity to servicers and borrowers.", 
                                "Second, the Bureau is modifying proposed \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) to enhance borrower protections by providing that servicers are required to treat a \u201cfacially complete\u201d application as complete for purposes of the \u00a7 1026.41(h) appeal right and the borrower response timelines in \u00a7 1024.41(e). As discussed above, proposed \u00a7 1026.41(c)(2)(iv) would have required servicers to treat the application as complete for purposes of the foreclosure referral ban in \u00a7 1024.41(f)(2) and the foreclosure sale limitations in \u00a7 1024.41(g) until the borrower had been given a reasonable opportunity to supply the missing information necessary to complete the loss mitigation application. However, for purposes of the appeal right under \u00a7 1024.41(h) and the borrower response timelines under \u00a7 1024.41(e), the proposal would have treated the application as complete only once the borrower submitted the additional information or documents needed to evaluate the application. Thus, under the proposal, if a servicer gave a borrower a reasonable expectation that he or she had submitted a complete application more than 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale but later requested more information pursuant to new \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), the borrower might not have received the right to an appeal or to a 14-day response time depending on the timing of the supplemental information request and the borrower's response. The Bureau has been persuaded that such a borrower should enjoy the benefit of the appeal right and the 14-day response timeline. Furthermore, the Bureau is persuaded by the comment that suggested that the protections of \u00a7 1024.41 should be triggered based on the date when a borrower submits all the documents and information as stated in the \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice, rather than when the servicer deems the application to be complete.", 
                                "Thus, under \u00a7 1026.41(c)(2)(iv) as adopted by the final rule, if a borrower submits a facially complete application that is later found by the servicer to require additional information or corrected documents to be evaluated, and the borrower subsequently provides the corrected documents or information necessary to complete the application, the application is treated as complete, for the purposes of \u00a7 1024.41(d), (e), (f)(2), (g), and (h), as of the date it was facially complete. However, the 30-day window during which the servicer must evaluate the borrower for all available loss mitigation options (as required pursuant to \u00a7 1026.41(c)) will begin only when the servicer receives the missing information. The Bureau continues to believe there is little value in requiring a servicer to evaluate a loss mitigation application when a servicer has determined certain items of information are missing.", 
                                "Finally, Bureau has adopted new comment 41(c)(2)(iv)-2 to address situations in which a borrower fails to provide the missing information within a reasonable timeframe as prescribed by the servicer. This comment states that, if the borrower fails to complete the application within the reasonable timeframe, the servicer may treat the application as incomplete.", 
                                "The Bureau is not addressing in this final rule comments that suggested further protections for borrowers are needed, including additional notice requirements. The Bureau believes these concerns are adequately addressed. Several protections already established by the rule, including the requirement to have polices and procedures reasonable designed to achieve the objective of facilitating compliance with the requirement to send an accurate \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice (in \u00a7 1024.38(b)(2)(iv); the continuity of contact requirements in \u00a7 1024.40, and the obligation on the servicer to use reasonable diligence in completing an application already require that servicers work with borrowers to complete a loss mitigation application. For example, the reasonable diligence obligation requires servicers to promptly seek documents or information necessary to complete a loss mitigation application, which the Bureau believes includes an obligation to work proactively with borrowers when they discover any additional documents or information are needed to complete the application, as well as notify a borrower when a submitted document is insufficient to complete an application\u2014for example, because a signature is missing. Servicers cannot be dilatory in seeking such materials or corrected documents. Given these and other protections and obligations, the Bureau believes borrowers will be adequately protected, because the rules should ensure they receive the benefits of foreclosure protections at the time their applications are facially complete, and will continue to receive those protections once they have submitted the additional materials. The Bureau notes that a servicer that complies with \u00a7 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement to provide an accurate \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) notice. The Bureau believes this approach appropriately balances the servicer's need to collect additional pieces of information while still providing protection for the borrower."

As a conforming amendment, the Bureau proposed to re-codify \u00a7 1024.41(d)(1) as \u00a7 1024.41(d) and to re-designate the corresponding commentary accordingly. The Bureau is finalizing these provisions as proposed.", 
                                "The Bureau also proposed to clarify the requirement in \u00a7 1024.41(d)(1), re-codified as \u00a7 1024.41(d), that a servicer must disclose the reasons for the denial of any trial or permanent loan modification option available to the borrower. The Bureau believed it was appropriate to clarify that the requirement to disclose the reasons for denial focuses on only those determinations actually made by the servicer and does not require a servicer to continue evaluating additional factors after the servicer has already decided to deny a borrower for a particular loss mitigation option. Thus, when a servicer's automated system uses a program that considers a borrower for a loan modification by proceeding through a series of questions and ends the process if the consumer is denied, the servicer need not modify the system to continue evaluating the borrower under additional criteria. For example, suppose a borrower must meet qualifications A, B, and C to receive a loan modification, but the borrower does not meet any of these qualifications. A servicer's system may start by asking if the borrower meets qualification A, and on the failure of that qualification end the analysis for that specific loan modification option. If a servicer were required to disclose all potential reasons why the borrower may have been denied for that loan modification option (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> A, B, and C), it would need to consider a lengthy series of hypothetical scenarios: for example, if the borrower had met qualification A, would the borrower also have met qualification B? The Bureau did not intend such a requirement, which it believes would be unnecessarily burdensome.", 
                                "The Bureau instead intended to require only the disclosure of the actual reason or reasons on which the borrower was evaluated and denied. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend \u00a7 1024.41(d) to require that a denial notice provided by the servicer must state the \u201cspecific reason or reasons\u201d for the denial and also, where applicable, disclose that the borrower was not evaluated based on other criteria. The notice would not be required to list such criteria. The Bureau believed that this additional information will help borrowers understand the status of their application and the fact that they were not fully evaluated under all factors (where applicable). The Bureau also proposed new comment 41(d)-4 stating that, if a servicer's system reaches the first issue that causes a denial but does not evaluate borrowers for additional factors, a servicer need only provide the reason or reasons actually considered. The Bureau believed this proposed amendment would appropriately balance potential concerns about compliance challenges with concerns about informing borrowers about the status of their applications and about information that is relevant to potential appeals."

The rule requires servicers to disclose the basis for the denial, so if a servicer denies a borrower for a loan modification option based on an NPV analysis, that servicer must disclose the factors used in the analysis. However, if a servicer denies a borrower a loan modification option on other grounds, it would be unduly burdensome for the servicer to disclose factors that would have been used, had the servicer done a NPV analysis."

A servicer also is prohibited from making such a notice or filing while a borrower's complete loss mitigation application is being evaluated. In response to numerous questions received by the Bureau about the meaning of the phrase \u201cfirst notice or filing,\u201d the Bureau proposed to redesignate comment 41(f)(1)-1 as comment 41(f)-1, and then revise it to clarify what actions \u00a7 1024.41(f) would prohibit.", 
                                "Specifically, the proposed comment would have stated that whether a document is considered the first notice or filing is determined under applicable State law. Under the proposal, a document that would be used as evidence of compliance with foreclosure practices required pursuant to State law would have been considered the first notice or filing. Thus, a servicer would have been prohibited from sending such a notice or filing such a document during the pre-foreclosure review period or during the review period for a complete loss mitigation application. Documents that would not be used in this fashion would not have been considered the first notice or filing. The proposed comment would have stated expressly that this prohibition does not extend to activity such as attempting to collect the debt, sending periodic statements, sending breach letters, or any other activity during the pre-foreclosure review period, so long as such documents would not be used as evidence of complying with requirements applicable pursuant to State law in connection with a foreclosure process.", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledged that, under the proposed interpretation, if a State law mandates a notice to a borrower of the availability of mediation as a prerequisite to commence foreclosure, such notices would be considered the \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau also recognized that existing State foreclosure processes often can be lengthy. The proposed comment sought to balance protecting consumers and encouraging communication between borrowers and servicers by providing borrowers sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application without the stress and costs of foreclosure, but also permitting servicers to communicate with borrowers to respond promptly to requests. However, recognizing potential practical difficulties for servicers as well as borrower protection concerns that could arise from chilling early communications provided for borrowers under State law, the Bureau sought comment on the best way to establish a workable rule that clearly identifies what is prohibited, while balancing these goals."

Numerous commenters, including trade organizations, the GSEs, individual servicers and credit unions, asserted that the proposed comment would cause significant delays in the foreclosure process, especially where the first notice or filing would be followed by lengthy periods mandated by State law before actual initiation of court proceedings or establishing a foreclosure sale date. These commenters asserted that the proposal would have prohibited often lengthy processes from starting until after 120 days of delinquency have passed. For example, commenters noted that Massachusetts requires its own notice and opportunity to cure process that may take up to 150 additional days before foreclosure is filed. Thus, if the notice beginning that cure process is deemed the \u201cfirst notice\u201d for purposes of the prohibition on foreclosure referral (as it would have been under the proposal), foreclosure proceedings may be delayed until the 270th day of delinquency. One industry commenter raised concerns that such delays would impact compliance with regulatory capital requirements.", 
                                "Industry commenters expressed substantial concerns with the proposal's use of the phrase \u201cevidence of compliance with State law.\u201d These commenters asserted that the phrase is vague, and that State law may often require proof of compliance with the mortgage contract's terms, which may include the sending of general default notices not expressly required by statute. The commenters indicated servicers would have difficulty understanding what documents were prohibited and likely would be discouraged from sending any early communications to borrowers if they later must use such document to show compliance with applicable State law.", 
                                "Industry commenters, State governments, and some consumer advocates indicated that the proposal likely would delay notices required under State-mandated pre-foreclosure programs. As these commenters noted, under the proposal such notices likely would constitute \u201cevidence of compliance with State law\u201d and thus would be prohibited until after the 120th day of delinquency. These commenters also asserted that such programs complement the Bureau's early intervention rule and that there is substantial benefit to borrowers in receiving these notices early in their delinquencies. For example, many statutory notices require that counseling, legal aid, or other resources be identified to borrowers, and consumer groups agreed that borrowers are more likely to respond and seek loss mitigation when they receive notices clearly informing them that foreclosure is imminent if they do not act. Several commenters pointed to data or experience that indicated many borrowers do not reach out to servicers for loss mitigation assistance until foreclosure notices or notices of default are sent. These commenters believed that borrowers would receive little benefit if these notices were delayed until after the 120th day of delinquency because the likelihood of a successful resolution would be reduced. On the whole, these commenters indicated that delaying State-mandated notices relating to loss mitigation programs or statutory rights to cure delinquencies would frustrate State efforts at avoiding foreclosure by making resolutions more difficult or cure more costly to consumers.", 
                                "As an alternative to the proposed interpretation of \u201cfirst notice or filing,\u201d many industry commenters recommended that the Bureau adopt an interpretation based on the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) definition of \u201cfirst legal,\u201d citing familiarity with this concept. In the alternative, some industry commenters suggested a more uniform and objective definition or a State-by-State determination. These commenters generally stated that a prohibition that extends to documents defined in a manner that closely tracks \u201cfirst legal\u201d would better facilitate compliance for industry, while at the same time would permit and encourage the early notices to borrowers, including those that provide counseling, legal aid, or other resources. A number of commenters suggested that specific notices be expressly permitted, including State-mandated outreach to delinquent borrowers and breach letters required by the GSEs."

                                "The Bureau is adopting a revised version of proposed comment 41(f)-1 that states a document is considered the \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d on the basis of foreclosure procedure under applicable State law, but adjusts the Bureau's interpretation of what constitutes a \u201cfirst notice or filing.\u201d Rather than relying on the general notion that any evidence of compliance with State foreclosure law constitutes a first notice or filing, the Bureau is revising comment 41(f)-1 and adopting four new subparts that are more specifically addressed to different types of foreclosure procedures. New comment 41(f)-1.i explains that, when the foreclosure procedure under applicable State law requires commencement of a court action or proceeding, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be filed with a court or other judicial body to commence the action or proceeding (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> a complaint, petition, order to docket, notice of hearing). The Bureau also is adopting new comment 41(f)-1.ii, which explains that, when the foreclosure procedure under applicable State law does not require a court action or proceeding, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be recorded or published to initiate the foreclosure process. To address situations not already covered by comments (i) and (ii), new comment 41(f)-1.iii provides that, where a foreclosure procedure does not require initiating a court action or proceeding or recording or publishing of any document, a document is considered a &#8220;first notice or filing&#8221; if it is the first document which establishes, sets or schedules the foreclosure sale date.", 
                                "As noted above, the proposal sought to balance protecting consumers and encouraging communication between servicers and borrowers. The Bureau believed that, under the proposed interpretation of \u201cfirst notice or filing,\u201d borrowers would be ensured sufficient time to submit a complete loss mitigation application, but servicers would still be able to send many of the typical early-default communications, so long as they were not being used as evidence of compliance with State law. The Bureau requested comment on whether the proposal established a workable rule that was clear, in light of varied foreclosure procedures in different states, and the multiple purposes for notices. As noted above, many commenters, including consumer advocate groups and State governments, indicated concerns with the proposed interpretation's impact on communication and its impact on State-mandated loss mitigation programs. Many commenters asserted that the proposal would result in either less or ineffective early default communication and <em data-original=\"E-03\">lessen</em> the likelihood that borrowers would successfully access loss mitigation resolutions or otherwise avoid foreclosure.", 
                                "The Bureau is persuaded by these comments that revising the interpretation is necessary to provide greater clarity and also provide for more effective pre-foreclosure outreach. As commenters noted, the proposed interpretation would have prohibited the use of many State-mandated notices that do not initiate foreclosure proceedings and are intended to provide borrowers with information about counseling and other loss mitigation resources as a means of avoiding foreclosure. In addition, the Bureau is persuaded by comments that the proposed interpretation would have chilled other servicer communications, such as cure notices or breach letters, based on confusion over whether such communications were \u201cevidence of compliance\u201d and thus prohibited by \u00a7 1024.41.", 
                                "The Bureau believes the interpretation of first notice or filing adopted by this final rule provides an objective basis for determining compliance with the prohibition on foreclosure referral. In addition, it addresses the concerns raised in comments that the proposal would restrict communications informing borrowers of assistance and statutory rights to cure. The Bureau agrees with commenters that permitting communication about cure rights or pre-foreclosure loss mitigation assistance or procedures available under State law, even within the first 120 days of a borrower's delinquency, furthers the objective of \u00a7 1024.41's loss mitigation procedures. The Bureau believes early communication to borrowers about resources such as housing counseling, emergency loan programs, and pre-foreclosure mediation will increase the likelihood that borrowers will submit complete applications in time to benefit from the full loss mitigation procedures under \u00a7 1024.41. The Bureau appreciates that, under this modified interpretation, some borrowers who have not yet submitted loss mitigation applications may face shorter foreclosure timeframes after the 120th day of delinquency than under the proposed interpretation. However, the Bureau believes the adopted interpretation provides sufficient opportunity for borrowers to seek loss mitigation assistance without the pressure of pending litigation or foreclosure proceedings. The Bureau also believes a borrower's ability to exercise a statutory or contractual right to cure a default likely will be greater where notice of the cure rights is provided before several months of arrearages have accumulated. While the proposed interpretation was not intended to prohibit sending any such notice, only one that would be used as evidence of compliance with applicable law, the modified interpretation provides greater clarity.", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledges that its interpretation of \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d may prohibit, during the 120-day period, initiation of State-mandated loss mitigation efforts or opportunities to cure in those jurisdictions where the applicable foreclosure procedure requires such information to appear first in a court filing, or a document that is recorded or published. However, were the Bureau to adopt an interpretation that excluded such notices from the definition of first filing, based on their inclusion of information related to cure rights or loss mitigation assistance, this likely would create significant confusion and frustrate the purposes of the rule, by permitting certain foreclosure actions within the 120-day period.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau is adding new comment 41(f)-1.iv to clarify that a document provided to a borrower that initially is not required to be filed, recorded or published is not considered the first notice or filing solely on the basis that the foreclosure procedure requires a copy of the document to be included as an attachment to a subsequent document required to be filed or recorded to carry out the foreclosure process. The Bureau is aware through comments that, in many states, letters or notices (including breach letters, notices of rights to cure) that are required to be sent to the borrower, <em data-original=\"E-03\">but do not initiate formal foreclosure proceedings,</em> nonetheless are required to be included in later filings, <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> as part of a complaint or subsequent pleading. Such letters or notices may be sent during the pre-foreclosure review period without violating the foreclosure referral ban.", 
                                "The interpretation of \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d adopted by this final rule closely tracks, but may not be identical in all jurisdictions, to the FHA's \u201cfirst legal action necessary to initiate foreclosure\u201d or \u201cfirst legal\u201d or \u201cfirst public\u201d action, as some commenters requested.\n            However, the Bureau believes to the extent there are jurisdictions where \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d of \u00a7 1024.41(f) is inconsistent with the FHA standard, it will not hinder servicers' compliance with obligations under the FHA or investor requirements based upon the FHA's standard. The Bureau notes that the \u201cfirst legal\u201d standard primarily serves to inform mortgagees of their contractual obligations as servicers of FHA-insured mortgages. In light of the fact that \u00a7 1024.41(f) is enforceable by private right of action, the Bureau is adopting this interpretation of \u201cfirst notice or filing\u201d in order to provide sufficient clarity to borrowers, servicers, and courts. The Bureau also believes this interpretation provides States with clarity of the application of \u00a7 1024.41(f), not just as to present State foreclosure procedure but with respect to future modifications of State law."

As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau is aware that there may be some circumstances when a foreclosure is not based upon a borrower's delinquency, and thus protections designed to provide delinquent borrowers time to bring their mortgages current or apply for loss mitigation (such as the 120-day ban on foreclosure referral) may not be appropriate or necessary. The Bureau proposed amending \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1) to provide the two exemptions for foreclosures based upon due-on-sale clauses and for joining a subordinate lienholder's foreclosure, but also recognized that other situations may exist that also warrant exclusion. Thus, in addition to the two situations described above, the Bureau sought comment on what other situations may be appropriate to exempt, or whether the proposed exemptions were appropriate in situations in which a borrower has submitted a complete loss mitigation application."

                                "The Bureau received substantial comments from trade associations, individual servicers including credit unions, and the GSEs, which generally supported the added exemptions to \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1). Industry commenters generally supported the proposed exemptions, citing a need to provide relief from the foreclosure referral ban where default is based upon a non-monetary provision of a mortgage. With respect to the Bureau's request for comment on other situations that may warrant exclusion, numerous commenters suggested the Bureau provide guidance or add exemptions for foreclosure based upon a determination that the property was abandoned or vacant. Some commenters advocated an exemption for abandoned properties and suggested the Bureau provide a list of factors to be considered in determining whether the property was abandoned. Consumer groups, however, expressed concerns that, because abandonment or vacancy status is necessarily a fact-specific determination, an exemption may facilitate evasion.", 
                                "In addition, some commenters suggested the Bureau exempt situations where the borrower is deceased without heirs or in other cases. Some industry commenters requested that the rule permit foreclosure within the 120-day period where borrowers have failed to maintain insurance or property tax payments or where the borrower had failed to pay late fees. Finally, some commenters requested an exemption for other situations including where borrowers commit waste, are non-responsive to the servicer's attempts to maintain live contact, or state a desire to surrender the property.", 
                                "Consumer groups acknowledged that situations may exist that warrant exclusion from the 120-day prohibition, such as the proposed exemptions, but raised concerns about their breadth. Specifically, these commenters expressed concerns that an exemption for all foreclosures based on violation of a due-on-sale clause may be overly broad, and could be construed to allow foreclosure where the transfer is to a deceased borrowers' family member or where a transfer occurs as a result of State divorce decree or probate order, or other transfer to a borrower's family member. Many of these commenters suggested that the exemption expressly exclude such transfers to the extent they were protected under the Garn-St. Germain Act.\n            Consumer advocate commenters also suggested that the exemption for joining a foreclosure action of a subordinate lienholder should be limited to situations where all of the servicers and lienholders with respect to the property are separate entities."

                                "The Bureau is adopting the amendments to \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1) as proposed, without adopting additional exemptions. The Bureau appreciates comments that suggested the 120-day prohibition was designed to protect delinquent borrowers, but should not extend to non-monetary defaults or breaches of the underlying mortgage agreement. However, the Bureau remains mindful of consumer protection concerns that could arise from a broader set of exemptions. For example, industry commenters suggested that foreclosure based on a borrower's failure to maintain insurance or pay property taxes should be excluded, but, as some of these commenters acknowledged, those and other examples provided are likely to coincide with borrower delinquency. The Bureau does not believe that servicers should be allowed to sidestep the borrower protections set forth in \u00a7 1024.41 for delinquent borrowers simply because borrowers may have breached other components of the underlying mortgage, such as requirements to pay property taxes, maintain insurance, or pay late fees. The Bureau believes that additional exemptions would create uncertainty and could potentially be construed in a manner that permits evasion of the requirements of \u00a7 1024.41(f). Moreover, the Bureau does not believe exemption from the pre-foreclosure review period is appropriate merely because foreclosure is based upon an obligation other than the borrower's monthly payment. In many instances, these borrowers are likely experiencing financial distress and thus may benefit from time to seek loss mitigation.", 
                                "For similar reasons, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to adopt an exemption from the 120-day prohibition for situations where a borrower may be deemed to commit \u201cwaste\u201d in violation of an underlying mortgage agreement. As noted above, the Bureau is concerned that such an exemption could be used to circumvent the 120-day prohibition for borrowers who are also delinquent. However, the Bureau also notes that what constitutes waste is very fact-specific and the few commenters who suggested an exemption provided no precise definition of the term. Furthermore, while mortgages typically permit foreclosure in the event of waste, they also frequently provide other non-foreclosure remedies. In light of the absence of evidence suggesting waste that would necessitate rapid foreclosure is a significant problem, the Bureau is convinced that no such exemption is necessary.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau does not believe any further narrowing or clarifying revisions to the due-on-sale clause exemption in \u00a7 1024.41(f)(1)(i), to protect transfers to family members or transfers ordered by divorce decree or probate proceedings, are necessary. The Bureau notes that, to the extent the Garn-St. Germain Act prohibits the exercise of due-on-sale clauses, the exemption from the 120-day period would not apply. The exemption does not alter limitations or obligations imposed on a servicer by another Federal or State law with respect to whether a due-on-sale clause validly may be exercised. Rather it merely provides an exception to the 120-day pre-foreclosure review period where the basis for foreclosure is a due-on-sale clause. The Bureau notes that servicers may not avail themselves of the due-on-sale clause exemption and make the first notice or filing before the 120th day of delinquency unless such a clause is validly enforceable.", 
                                "The Bureau is also not adopting any limitation on the exemption for joining a foreclosure initiated by a subordinate lienholder. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to limit the exemption application to only those situations where the senior and junior liens are held or serviced by separate entities, as was requested. In the case where an entity services both a first and a second lien, the servicer will be required to complete the pre-foreclosure review for the second lien, and will be required to respond to a borrower's loss mitigation application with respect to the first mortgage as well. Furthermore, the comments did not provide an adequate explanation to persuade the Bureau that servicers are more likely to pursue foreclosure in a manner that evades the 120-day pre-foreclosure review period when the senior and junior lien are held and serviced by the same entity.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau notes that several commenters requested that the Bureau exempt vacant or abandoned properties from the 120-day prohibition. However, while many commenters asserted that there is a limited benefit to prohibiting foreclosure referral where a property is \u201cvacant\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d, they also generally agreed that such a determination depends on the individual facts and circumstances, and may vary according applicable State law. While some commenters suggested the Bureau adopt a multiple-factor test to determine whether a property was \u201cabandoned,\u201d the Bureau believes any such test would inherently rely on a holistic determination based on individual facts and circumstances, and would not provide the clear guideline that the Bureau believes is appropriate with respect to the prohibition on foreclosure referral. Moreover, as noted by consumer groups, a number of borrower protection concerns could arise from affording servicers too much discretion in determining whether a property is abandoned or vacant. In addition, some industry commenters conceded that it would be rare for a property to be determined abandoned or vacant earlier than the 120th day of delinquency.", 
                                "For these reasons, the Bureau is not adopting an exclusion from the 120-day prohibition for vacant or abandoned properties. However, the Bureau notes that the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1024.39 through 1024.41 apply only to a mortgage loan secured by property that is a borrower's principal residence. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 CFR 1024.30(c)(2). Thus, depending on the facts and circumstances, it is possible that some foreclosures against vacant or abandoned properties will not be subject to &#167; 1024.41(f)."

                                "In addition to the HOEPA and ATR balloon provisions discussed above, the definitions of \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d also relate to the \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) exemption from the requirement that creditors establish escrow accounts for certain higher-priced mortgage loans available to small creditors that operate predominantly in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas. The exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) was designed to promote access to credit by exempting small creditors in rural or underserved areas that might have sufficient difficulty maintaining escrow accounts that they would curtail making higher-priced mortgage loans rather than trigger the escrow account requirement. As adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, and as amended by the May 2013 Escrows Final Rule,\n            the exemption is available to creditors that extended more than 50 percent of their total covered transactions secured by a first lien on properties that are located in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d counties during the preceding calendar year. In general, a county's status as \u201crural\u201d is defined in relation to Urban Influence Codes (UICs) established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.", 
                                "Because of updated information from the 2010 Census, however, numerous counties' status under the Bureau's definition will change between 2013 and 2014, with a small number of new counties meeting the definition of \u201crural\u201d and approximately 82 counties no longer meeting that definition. The Bureau estimates that approximately 200-300 otherwise eligible creditors during 2013 could lose their eligibility for 2014 solely because of changes in the status of the counties in which they operate (assuming the geographical distribution of their mortgage originations does not change significantly over the relevant period).\n            \n          ", 
                                "In light of the Bureau's intent to review whether the definitions of \u201crural\u201d and \u201cunderserved\u201d should be adjusted further during the two-year transition period for balloon-payment mortgages discussed above, the Bureau proposed to revise the exemption provided by \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) to the general requirement that creditors establish an escrow account for first lien higher-priced mortgage loans where a small creditor operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas and meets various other criteria. The proposal would have revised \u00a7 1026.35(b) and its commentary to minimize volatility in the definitions while they are being re-evaluated. The proposal also would have amended \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and its commentary to conform to the expansion of the exemption to creditors that may meet the &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) criteria for calendar year 2014 based on loans made in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties in calendar year 2011, but not 2012 or 2013.",

The same housing counseling organization that disagreed with the balloon exception adopted by the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule also disagreed with the original exemption from the escrows requirement and thus also the proposed expansion. As before, this commenter did not raise any specific issues related to the proposal, but rather stated that all higher-priced mortgage loans should be escrowed, without exception.

                                "The Bureau is adopting revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) as proposed. The amended provision provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must have extended more than 50 percent of its total covered transactions secured by a first lien on properties located in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d counties during any of the preceding three calendar years. The provision thus prevents a creditor from losing eligibility for the exemption under the \u201crural or underserved\u201d element of the test unless it has failed to exceed the 50-percent threshold three years in a row.", 
                                "As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C), the Bureau also is modifying the exception from the prohibition on balloon payments for high-cost mortgages in that section. Section 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) provides an exception to the general prohibition on balloon payments for high-cost mortgages for balloon-payment qualified mortgages made by certain creditors operating predominantly in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas. Believing that the same rationale for allowing balloon-payment qualified mortgages made by creditors in rural or underserved areas applies to high-cost mortgages, the Bureau adopted the \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) exception in the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule. As explained above, the Bureau believes the same underlying rationale for the two-year transition period for balloon-payment qualified mortgages described above applies equally to the \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) exception from the high-cost mortgage balloon prohibition. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to extend this temporary framework to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) and therefore is amending \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) to include loans meeting the criteria under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6). Thus, for both balloon-payment qualified mortgages and for the high-cost mortgage balloon prohibition, the Bureau has adopted a two-year transition period during which the special treatment of balloon-payment loans does not depend on the creditor operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas.", 
                                "The Bureau considered taking the same approach with regard to the escrow requirement but concluded ultimately that a smaller adjustment was appropriate. Because higher-priced mortgage loans are already subject to an escrow requirement, all creditors are currently required to maintain escrow accounts for such loans. Implementation of the amendments to the exemption will thus reduce burden for some creditors, but does not impose different requirements than the status quo except as to the length of time that an escrow account must be maintained. This is fundamentally different than the ability-to-repay and high-cost mortgage requirements, which would prohibit new balloon-payment loans from being accorded qualified mortgage status or from being made going forward absent implementation of the special exemptions. In addition, the Bureau may change the definitions of rural or underserved areas as the result of its re-examination process but does not anticipate lifting the requirement that creditors operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas to qualify for the exemption because Congress specifically contemplated that limitation on the escrows exemption. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to leave the definition in place, but to prevent volatility in the definition from negatively affecting creditors while the Bureau re-evaluates the underlying definitions. The Bureau believes that, as with the two balloon-payment provisions for which the Bureau believes two-year transition periods are appropriate, this amendment will benefit consumers by expanding access to credit in certain areas that met the definitions of \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d at some time in the preceding three calendar years and also will facilitate compliance for creditors that make these loans. The Bureau also believes that the amendment will promote additional consistency between the regulatory provisions adopted by the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, the 2013 ATR Final Rule, and the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, thereby facilitating compliance for affected creditors.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that the mechanics of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) differ slightly from the express transition period ending on January 10, 2016, under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6). Thus, this amendment does not parallel the same transition period precisely, as does revised \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C), which simply incorporates \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6)'s conditions by cross-reference. Instead, revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) approximates a two-year transition period by extending from one to three years the time for which a creditor, once eligible for the exemption, cannot lose that eligibility because of changes in the rural (or underserved) status of the counties in which the creditor operates. Because the 2013 Escrows Final Rule took effect on June 1, 2013, the escrows provisions already have begun operating over seven months earlier than the provisions adopted by the 2013 HOEPA and ATR Final Rules (which take effect on January 10, 2014). Thus, whereas the two balloon-payment provisions specifically last through January 10, 2016, the escrows-requirement exemption will guarantee eligibility (for a creditor that is eligible during 2013 with respect to operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas, and meets the other applicable criteria) through 2015. Thus, the revised \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) exemption will approximately, though not exactly, track the extension of the balloon exemption for qualified mortgages under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(6), and the extension of the HOEPA balloon exemption under revised \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C).", 
                                "In addition to the changes discussed above, the Bureau also is amending \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and its commentary to conform to the expansion of the exemption to creditors that may meet the section 35(b)(2)(iii)(A) criteria for calendar year 2014 based on loans made in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties in calendar year 2011, but not 2012 or 2013. Section &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) currently prohibits any creditor from availing itself of the exemption if it maintains escrow accounts for any extensions of consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling that it or its affiliate currently service, unless the escrow accounts were established for first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2013, or were established after consummation as an accommodation for distressed consumers. With respect to loans where escrows were established on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2013, the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule explained that the Bureau believes creditors should not be penalized for compliance with the then current regulation, which would have required any such loans to be escrowed after April 1, 2010, and prior to June 1, 2013&#8212;the date the exemption took effect. The Bureau understands that creditors that did not make more than 50 percent of their first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties in calendar year 2012 would have been ineligible for the exemption for calendar year 2013, and thus would have been required under &#167; 1026.35(a) to establish escrow accounts for any higher-priced mortgage loans those creditors made after June 1, 2013. However, it is possible in light of the amendments the Bureau is adopting that some of these same creditors may have met this criteria during calendar year 2011&#8212;and thus, because the Bureau is finalizing the proposal and allowing creditors to qualify for the exemption (assuming they satisfy the other conditions set forth in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), (C), and (D))&#8212;such creditors will qualify for the exemption in 2014. However, absent additional clarification, there would be one barrier: For applications received on or after June 1, 2013, but before the date the proposed amendment takes effect (as proposed, January 1, 2014), such a creditor that made a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan would have been required to escrow for that loan, and thus would be deemed ineligible under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). The Bureau does not believe that such creditors should lose the exemption because they were ineligible prior to the proposed amendment taking effect and thus made loans with escrows from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. As the Bureau discussed in the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau believes creditors should not be penalized for compliance with the current regulation. The Bureau thus believes it is appropriate to amend &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1.iv to exclude escrow accounts established after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2014.", 
                                "In addition, the Bureau is revising comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>)-1.iv to clarify that the date ranges provided in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) apply to transactions for which creditors received applications on or after April 1, 2010, and before January 1, 2014. As discussed above, the Bureau believes such creditors should still qualify for the exemption provided under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) so long as they do not establish new escrow accounts for transactions for which they received applications on or after January 1, 2014, other than those described in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>), and they otherwise qualify under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). The Bureau believes this clarification reflects both the manner in which the 2013 Escrows Rule originally applied to transactions and the applicability of this final rule.\n          "

This comment provides that the definition of loan originator does not include a creditor's or loan originator's employee who provides loan originator or creditor contact information to a consumer, provided the employee does not, among other things, \u201cdiscuss particular credit terms available from a creditor.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) and comments 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em> through-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">4</em> (other similar references to credit terms). This exclusion also assists in defining persons who are loan originators in the sense that it implies persons who do discuss specific or particular credit terms, as this activity is further clarified in this rule, would be included in the definition.", 
                                "Following publication of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from loan originators and creditors seeking guidance on the meaning of \u201ccredit terms\u201d in these various contexts. In light of these inquiries, the Bureau was concerned that the term \u201ccredit terms\u201d could have been construed too broadly and in a manner that could render any person that provides such general information a loan originator, which was not the Bureau's intent. Rather, the Bureau generally intended the references to \u201ccredit terms\u201d throughout \u00a7 1026.36(a) to refer to particular credit terms that are or may be made available <em data-original=\"E-03\">to the consumer</em> selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics. Distinct from such particular credit terms are general credit terms that a loan originator or creditor makes available and advertises to the public at large, such as where such person merely states: &#8220;We offer rates as low as 3% to qualified consumers.&#8221;", 
                                "To address these questions, the Bureau proposed to clarify usage of the term \u201ccredit terms\u201d throughout the section in several ways. First, the Bureau noted that the definition of \u201ccredit terms,\u201d which explains the term includes rate, fees, and other costs, had been provided only by a parenthetical clause in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) (a single exclusion that relates to retailers of manufactured homes) rather than in a separate, definitional provision. Thus, the definition appears to be limited to that single provision, even though the term is used in multiple places throughout \u00a7 1026.36(a). For clarification purposes, the Bureau proposed to move this definition from \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), to new \u00a7 1026.36(a)(6), which explicitly makes the definition applicable to the entire section. The Bureau solicited comment on whether additional guidance concerning the meaning of particular credit terms that are or may be made available to the consumer in light of the consumer's financial characteristics is necessary, and if so, what clarifications would be helpful.", 
                                "Second, the Bureau proposed to revise \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and (B), and comments 36(a)-1 and -4 to address inconsistencies regarding the meaning of \u201ccredit terms,\u201d and to clarify that an activity involving credit terms for purposes of determining when a person is a loan originator must relate to \u201cparticular credit terms that are or may be available from a creditor to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics,\u201d not credit terms generally. The proposal would have clarified that a person who discusses with a consumer that, based on the consumer's financial characteristics, a creditor should be able to offer the consumer an interest rate of 3%, would be considered a loan originator. However, a person who merely states general information such as \u201cwe offer rates as low as 3% to qualified consumers\u201d would not have been considered a loan originator because the person is not offering particular credit terms that are or may be available to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics."

These commenters also asked the Bureau to clarify that an assessment of a consumer's financial characteristics does not include a person simply having general knowledge of the consumer's account or finances, but requires an actual assessment of the consumer's financial characteristics that form the basis for selection of credit terms. Consumer groups generally supported the clarification, but suggested that an assessment of a consumer's financial characteristics should include steering based on other factors such as race, ethnicity, or zip code."

In response to public comments requesting additional clarification, the Bureau is modifying proposed \u00a7 1026.36(a)(6) to clarify that credit terms are selected based on a consumer's financial characteristics when those terms are selected based on factors that may influence a credit decision, such as the consumer's debts, income, assets, or credit history. The Bureau intends this language to capture situations where credit terms are offered or discussed as available or potentially available to a consumer based on that consumer's ability to obtain such credit. This would include examining the consumer's credit history (which could include a credit score), income, debts, or assets and then selecting credit terms that are either available or potentially available to the consumer based on those factors. The Bureau does not intend this language to cover situations where, for example, an employee of a loan originator or creditor may be aware of a consumer's assets, income, or other factors but does not select credit terms based on those factors.",

To the extent that inappropriate non-financial characteristics such as race, gender, or ethnicity may factor into the selection of credit terms, the Bureau believes such situations would be addressed by other applicable laws such as ECOA and the Fair Housing Act. In any event, the Bureau did not intend this clarification to define the appropriate means of evaluating consumers for credit; rather it only intended to clarify when a person may be considered a loan originator by virtue of discussing credit terms with a consumer.

While generally any person, including a loan originator employee would be acting as a loan originator for purposes of \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1) if he or she refers consumers to a particular creditor by providing an application from that creditor, the Bureau does not believe that a loan originator or creditor employee should be considered a loan originator for simply providing an application from the loan originator or creditor entity for which he or she works. The Bureau believes that, in such a case, provided that the person does not assist the consumer in completing the application or otherwise influence his or her decision, the person is performing an administrative task on behalf of the entity for which he or she works. Thus, in the Bureau's view, there would be little appreciable benefit for consumers for the rule to regard such persons as loan originators.",

Moreover, the Bureau notes that classifying such individuals as loan originators for providing an application without first waiting for an express request from the consumer would subject them to the requirements applicable to loan originators. Again, in the Bureau's view, there would be little appreciable benefit for consumers for the rule to regard such persons as loan originators where the person is simply providing a credit application from the entity for whom the person works. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting comment 36(a)-4.i as proposed, including removing the condition that the provision of the application must be \u201cat the request of the consumer\u201d and making a conforming change to the comment to only apply to employees of the loan originator or creditor, not all persons.

The Bureau also is removing a reference to \u201ccredit products\u201d which also is inconsistent with comment 36(a)-4.ii.B. The Bureau believes in both instances the rule should consider employees to be loan originators when such persons discuss credit terms that are or may be made available by a creditor or loan originator to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics, not when they simply discuss particular categories of credit products generally, such as mortgages or home equity loans.

Prior to issuing the proposal, the Bureau received many inquiries on this topic from stakeholders expressing concern that, absent a clarifying amendment, the rule could be interpreted to require tellers, greeters, or other such employees to be classified as loan originators for merely providing contact information to a consumer who did not clearly or explicitly ask for it.

Second, the Bureau is clarifying that the exclusion is only available to employees of a loan originator or creditor that provide the contact information of the loan originator or creditor entity for which he or she works, or of a person who works for that same entity. As proposed, the Bureau is removing the qualifying phrase \u201cin response to the consumer's request.\u201d The Bureau believes ambiguity regarding the meaning of \u201cin response to a consumer's request\u201d could have caused unnecessary compliance challenges. In such instances, the Bureau does not believe tellers or other such staff should be considered loan originators for merely providing loan originator or creditor contact information to the consumer (which would consist of such an employee directing a consumer to a loan originator who works for the same entity, or a creditor that is the same entity, as made explicit to conform the language in comments 4.i and 4.ii.B). The Bureau also notes that classifying such individuals as loan originators would subject them to the requirements applicable to loan originators with, in the Bureau's view, little appreciable benefit for consumers. However, the Bureau is retaining language, with some conforming changes, that would cover within the definition of \u201cloan originator\u201d any such employee of a creditor or loan originator organization who, in the course of providing loan originator or creditor contact information to the consumer, directs that consumer to a particular loan originator or particular creditor based on his or her assessment of the consumer's financial characteristics or discusses particular credit terms that are or may be available from a creditor or loan originator to the consumer selected based on consumer's financial characteristics. The Bureau believes these actions can influence the credit terms that the consumer ultimately obtains, and continues to believe these actions should result in application of the requirements imposed by the rule on loan originators.

The Bureau recognizes that the proposed amendments did not expressly limit the exclusion in this way. However, the Bureau intended that the exclusion be subject to this limitation and believes it was strongly implied, given that the language of the exclusion begins with the qualification that the definition of loan originator does not include persons who,\u201d as employees of a creditor or loan originator,\u201d engage in certain activities. The fact that the exclusion only applies to persons in their capacity as employees of creditors or loan originators signals that they are only providing loan originator or creditor contract information for the entity for which they work. The Bureau did not contemplate that such persons would provide contact information, as employees of a creditor or loan originator, to loan originators or creditors that were not their employers and no comments indicating a different understanding of this provision were received. However, to better clarify application of the provision, the Bureau is modifying comment 36(a)-4.ii.B to state that the exclusion only extends to employees providing the contact information of \u201cthe entity for which he or she works or of a person who works for that same entity.\u201d The Bureau believes this will eliminate any ambiguity in the proposed comment that may have led such employees to believe the exclusion would extend to providing contact information for loan originators or creditors outside the entity for which they work. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting this revised comment as proposed with this modification.", 
                                "Finally, as discussed in greater detail below in the section that addresses employees of manufactured housing retailers, the Bureau also received some comments that suggested manufactured housing retailer employees should be exempt from the loan originator definition altogether for \u201creferring,\u201d or otherwise should fall under this particular exclusion, regardless of whether they are employees, agents, or contractors of a loan originator or creditor. As discussed below in the discussion of \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), the Bureau does not believe that any additional amendments to this comment are necessary that relate to manufactured housing retailer employees."

The proposed rule preamble also provided examples of how the proposed revisions to comment 36(a)-4.i would affect such employees of manufactured home retailers. As a result of these proposed revisions, employees (or agents or contractors) of manufactured home retailers who provide a credit application form from one particular creditor or loan originator organization that is not the entity for which they work would not have qualified for the exclusions in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) or \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) and comment 36(a)-4.i. would not apply. In contrast, an employee of a manufactured home retailer who simply provides a credit application form from one particular creditor or loan originator organization that is his or her employer potentially would have been eligible for the exclusions in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(B) and comment 36(a)-4.i potentially would have applied. An agent or contractor of a manufactured home retailer who simply provides a credit application form from one particular creditor or loan originator organization it works for as agent or contractor potentially would have been eligible for the exclusion in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and comment 36(a)-4.i. potentially would have applied. The proposed revisions also would have clarified that comment 36(a)-4.i. would apply to someone who merely delivers a completed credit application form from the consumer to a creditor or loan originator if other conditions are met, but would have removed language that could have been misinterpreted to suggest that comment 36(a)-4.i. would apply to someone who accepts an application in the sense of taking or helping the consumer complete an application could be eligible for the exclusion."

Specifically, these comments relate to the illustrations of the proposed amendments the Bureau provided in the preamble indicating that comment 36(a)-4.i would only apply to manufactured housing retailer employees who also are employees (or agents or contractors) of the creditor or loan originator. Commenters expressed concern that manufactured housing retailer employees are typically not employees, agents, or contractors of a loan originator or creditor, and thus would only be able to take advantage of this particular exclusion in the case where the retailer itself provides financing or acts as the loan originator. These commenters suggested that retailer employees should be allowed to \u201crefer\u201d customers to particular loan originators or creditors other than the retailer itself without being considered loan originators, so long as the other conditions set forth in comment 36(a)-4.i are met. In addition, these commenters also suggested that their employees should not be covered by the loan originator rules at all to the extent that they do not receive compensation from any creditor for such activity. No other commenters focused on application of the rules to manufactured home retailer employees."

                                "As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting several clarifying amendments and additional commentary to address comments from the manufactured housing industry that questioned the applicability to manufactured home retailer employees of commentary that describes \u201creferral\u201d as loan originator activity and of various exclusions set forth in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A), \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), and discussed in comment 36(a)-4 and its subparts.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Background.</em> As an initial interpretive matter, the Bureau believes it is helpful to outline the statutory provision implemented by &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), and how it relates to other provisions implemented by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule. TILA section 103(cc)(2)(A) provides a three-part test for determining if a person is a loan originator, namely that, for or in expectation of direct or indirect compensation or gain, a person (1) Takes a mortgage application, (2) assists a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain a mortgage loan, or (3) offers or negotiates terms of a mortgage loan. The language of TILA section 103(cc) that defines a &#8220;mortgage originator&#8221; does not specifically include the term &#8220;refer&#8221; or its variants. However, the Bureau has interpreted both &#8220;assists a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain a residential mortgage loan&#8221; under section 103(cc)(2)(A)(ii) and &#8220;offers&#8221; under section 103(cc)(2)(A)(iii) to include a referral of a consumer to a loan originator or creditor.\n            \n          ", 
                                "This definition, which forms the basis for the definition of loan originator adopted in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i), applies generally to all persons, unless one of a limited number of exclusions applies. One such exclusion exists for manufactured home retailer employees in TILA section 103(cc)(2)(C)(ii), and provides that the second part of the three-part test described above\u2014assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain a mortgage loan\u2014does not render a retailer employee a loan originator provided the employee does not engage in either of the other two steps (taking an application or offering or negotiating terms) and also does not advise a consumer on loan terms (including rates, fees, and other costs). Thus, a retailer employee who merely assists without offering, negotiating, taking an application, or advising, is not a loan originator (while one who offers or negotiates, takes an application, or advises on loan terms would be a loan originator).", 
                                "This statutory provision was implemented by \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which is based on, and largely tracks, the statutory language. Consistent with this statutory structure, \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) provides an exclusion for \u201cAn employee of a manufactured home retailer who does not take a consumer credit application, offer or negotiate credit terms available from a creditor, or advise a consumer on credit terms (including rates, fees, and other costs) available from a creditor.\u201d The effect of this exclusion is that retailer employees are loan originators if they do anything in the general, core definition in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i) other than \u201cassist\u201d in a manner that doesn't constitute taking, advising, offering or negotiating, or advising on credit terms. Because both \u201cassisting\u201d and \u201coffering\u201d include the activity of referring, a retailer employee who makes a referral is \u201coffering\u201d and therefore is a loan originator.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau believes these provisions make clear how employees of manufactured housing retailers fit within the \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i) definition of loan originator, including with respect to referrals as described in comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1.</em> The Bureau also provided some additional explanation in the Supplementary Information to the proposed rule, which sought to clarify further the application of comment 36(a)-4.i to such employees. However, the Bureau continues to receive inquiries from industry, including comments received in connection with the June 2013 Proposal, that indicate there is still substantial confusion regarding the application of these provisions and comments to employees of manufactured housing retailers. For this reason, the Bureau is adopting additional commentary to provide further guidance and codify explanations previously set forth in the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule and the June 2013 Proposal.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Proposed amendments to &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B).</em> The Bureau is not adopting in this final rule proposed amendments to &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B) other than moving the definition of &#8220;credit terms&#8221; to &#167; 1026.36(a)(6). As discussed above related to &#8220;credit terms,&#8221; the Bureau proposed to modify the reference to &#8220;credit terms&#8221; in &#167;&#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), as well as comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B, to be limited to &#8220;credit terms available from a creditor to that consumer selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics.&#8221; As discussed above, the Bureau believes this limitation is appropriate in the context of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B. Each of these provisions addresses situations where employees of a loan originator or creditor may, absent exception, be considered loan originators for conducting activity within the entities for which they work. For example, &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) relates to persons who perform purely administrative or clerical tasks on behalf of a person who is classified as a loan originator or creditor, while comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B relate to determining whether an employee of a loan originator or creditor engages in &#8220;referring&#8221; by providing an application from the entity for which such person works, or providing loan originator or creditor contact information for a loan originator or creditor that is or works for the same entity. Each of these situations applies to persons who may be assisting loan originators within the same entity or otherwise technically &#8220;referring&#8221; consumers to loan originators or creditors that are or work for the same entity. However, upon further consideration the Bureau believes the limitation is not appropriate in the context of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which states that a manufactured home retailer employee would not be considered a loan originator if that person does not, among other things, &#8220;offer or negotiate credit terms&#8221; or &#8220;advise a consumer on credit terms.&#8221; The limitation is only intended to apply in the context of an employee of a loan originator or creditor assisting a loan originator or making a referral to the loan originator or creditor entity for which such person works. To the extent a retailer of manufactured housing is also a loan originator or creditor, the exclusions under &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(A) and comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B may be available for its employees. However, the limitation has no applicability outside of the loan originator or creditor employer/employee context and, accordingly, is not being included as the Bureau proposed in &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B), which addresses a different employer/employee context.", 
                                "Accordingly, the Bureau is not adopting this proposed change to \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1)(i)(B).", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Referrals.</em> The Bureau is amending comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> to explain further the underlying statutory and regulatory bases for including &#8220;referrals&#8221; as loan originator activity. As adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> explains what actions constitute &#8221; referring&#8221; for purposes of &#167; 1026.36(a)(1)(i), while comment 36(a)-4 and its subparts provide guidance on certain activities that do not constitute referring. The Bureau is amending this comment to explain that referring is an activity included under each of the activities of offering, arranging, or assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain an extension of credit. Accordingly, the Bureau believes this amendment makes clear that, while a referral may be considered &#8220;assisting,&#8221; it also falls within other statutory and regulatory categories of loan originator activity not excluded from the loan originator definition for manufactured housing retailer employees. The Bureau believes the discussion above and the conforming revision to comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> better clarify what activities, when done by an employee of a retailer of manufactured homes, will cause such an employee to be classified as a loan originator for purposes of &#167; 1026.36. The Bureau further notes this revision is consistent with the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which provides an extensive discussion of the activities covered by TILA section 103(cc)(2)(A)(ii).\n            As noted above in this preamble, the retailer employee exclusion allows such an employee to engage in &#8220;assisting&#8221; activities in a manner that doesn't constitute taking, advising, offering or negotiating, or advising on credit terms.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">New commentary.</em> In addition, the Bureau is adding new commentary to provide further guidance on what activities may be considered &#8220;assisting,&#8221; but not other loan originator activities such as offering, arranging, or taking an application. In the Bureau's view, these activities, when engaged in by employees of manufactured housing retailers (in the absence of other activities), do not render such employees loan originators for purposes of &#167; 1026.36. Accordingly, to provide greater clarity concerning the retailer employee exclusion consistent with these conclusions, a new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B) is added by this final rule. The comment states that engaging in certain listed activities, as described below, does not make such an employee a loan originator.", 
                                "The Bureau is adding new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-1.i to explain that a retailer employee may generally describe the credit application process to a consumer and that this activity, standing alone, would not cause the employee to be considered a loan originator.\n            However, the retailer employee would be considered a loan originator if he or she advises on credit terms available from a creditor.", 
                                "The Bureau is adding new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-1.ii to explain that a retailer employee may prepare residential mortgage loan packages without being considered a loan originator.\n            Thus, a retailer employee may compile and process application materials and supporting documentation and, further consistent with the Final Rule, provide general application instruction to consumers so consumers can complete an application, but without interacting or communicating with the consumer regarding specific transaction terms.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that this comment is consistent with the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which states:", 
                                "The Bureau agrees that persons generally engaged in loan processing orwho compile and process application materials and supportingdocumentation and do not take an application, collect information onbehalf of the consumer, or communicate or interact with consumers regardingspecific transaction terms or products are not loan originators (see the separatediscussion above on taking an application and collecting informationon behalf of the consumer).\n              \n            ", 
                                "In contrast, however, the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule also noted that \u201cfilling out a consumer's application, inputting the information into an online application or other automated system, and taking information from the consumer over the phone to complete the application should be considered `tak[ing] an application' for the purposes of the rule.\u201d\n            Because the retailer employee exclusion does not apply if the employee engages in taking an application, filling out a consumer's application, inputting the information into an online application or other automated system, and taking information from the consumer over the phone to complete the application would make the employee a loan originator.", 
                                "The Bureau is adding new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-1.iii to explain that a retailer employee may collect information on behalf of the consumer with regard to a residential mortgage loan.\n\n            This activity is not included in the activities covered by taking or offering or assisting that would make a retailer employee a loan originator. Comment 36(a)-1.i. <em data-original=\"E-03\">3.</em> and the Supplementary Information to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule describe the activity of collecting information on behalf of the consumer as including gathering information or supporting documentation from third parties on behalf of the consumer to provide to the consumer, for the consumer then to provide in the application or for the consumer to submit to the loan originator or creditor.\n            \n          ",

                                "The Bureau believes that most consumers purchasing a manufactured home will need financing, and that a limited set of options may be available. As public commenters have noted, only a small number of creditors make loans secured by manufactured homes, and it is beneficial to consumers for that information to be made available to them by a retailer. To facilitate consumer access to credit in this situation, new comment 36(a)(1)(i)(B)-.1.iv allows a retailer employee to make general information about creditors or loan originators available, which includes making available, in a neutral manner, general brochures or information about the different creditors or loan originators that may offer financing to a consumer, but does not include recommending a particular creditor or loan originator or otherwise influencing the consumer's decision. The Bureau believes this comment falls within the purview of the quoted portion of comment 36(a)-1.i.A. <em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em> above, taking into consideration the unique circumstances and the limited statutory exclusion.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau notes that the comment extends to providing general information about loan originators (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> mortgage brokers) as well as creditors. Based on public comments, the Bureau believes that under current market conditions only a small number of specialized creditors currently operate in this market, and the Bureau is not aware of any mortgage brokers or similar loan originators that currently operate in this space. Nevertheless, the Bureau recognizes that circumstances may change and brokers or other loan originators may decide to offer loans secured by manufactured homes, and if that were to occur the Bureau believes the same logic that applies to creditors described above would apply with respect to these persons or organizations. Accordingly, the comment includes loan originators as well as creditors."

Section 1026.36(a) describes these activities broadly to include any such person who \u201ctakes an application, offers, arranges, assists a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain, negotiates, or otherwise obtains or makes an extension of consumer credit for another person; or through advertising or other means of communication represents to the public that such person can or will perform any of these activities.\u201d Commentary to \u00a7 1026.36(a) further describes and provides illustrations of these activities, including how the practice of \u201creferring\u201d consumers to creditors or loan originators, may affect one's status under the section.", 
                        "Following publication of the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, the Bureau received numerous inquiries from industry regarding the activities that, if done for compensation or gain, would cause a person to be classified as a \u201cloan originator\u201d under \u00a7 1026.36. As discussed below, many of these inquiries sought clarification regarding specific terms used throughout the section, such as \u201ccredit terms,\u201d or guidance on how the provision may apply to certain loan originator or creditor employees, agents or contractors such as tellers and greeters, as well as other interpretive questions. In response, the Bureau proposed several amendments to \u00a7 1026.36(a) and associated commentary adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule to resolve inconsistencies in wording, to conform the comments to the intended operation of the regulation text, and to address issues raised during the regulatory implementation process. The Bureau proposed these changes pursuant to its TILA section 105(a) and Dodd-Frank Act section 1022(b)(1) authority. As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting most of these amendments as proposed with some revisions and additional clarifying amendments.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed to revise comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B to clarify those provisions' application to loan originator or creditor agents and contractors as well as employees. The Bureau is not adopting this aspect of the proposal. As discussed below, comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B illustrate two situations where an employee of a creditor or loan originator is conducting \u201cin house\u201d activity for his or her employer that is not considered to be \u201creferring\u201d: (1) Handing applications from the employer to a consumer; and (2) providing loan originator or creditor contact information for the loan originator or creditor entity for which the person works, or a person that works for the same entity. The Bureau proposed to clarify that comments 36(a)-4.i and 36(a)-4.ii.B may be available to certain persons who work for creditors or loan originators, but may not technically be \u201cemployed\u201d by the loan originator or creditor organization\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> contract employees, temporary employees, interns, or other persons who may be working on a voluntary basis or being paid by another entity. However, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes the terms &#8220;agent&#8221; and &#8220;contractor&#8221; could be interpreted more broadly than the Bureau intended to include independent contractors or agents used by loan originators or creditors to refer customers to that loan originator or creditor. The Bureau did not intend these provisions to be applied this broadly, and also is concerned that such a reading could be inconsistent with other applicable laws, such as RESPA's prohibition on referral fees for federally related mortgages. Accordingly, the Bureau is limiting the scope of this comment to employees of loan originators or creditors.", 
                        "The Bureau notes, however, that this does not mean these provisions may never be available to certain persons who may possibly be considered agents or contractors, such as temps or contract employees. While these provisions are limited to employees of creditors or loan originators, \u00a7 1026.2(b)(3) states that any terms not defined by Regulation Z is given the meanings given to them by State law or contract. The Bureau believes the term \u201cemployee\u201d\u2014which is not defined under Regulation Z\u2014is commonly defined under State law as well as employment contracts, and may extend to such persons in appropriate circumstances."

As the Bureau explained in the proposal, nearly all of the proposed revisions address the commentary sections that interpret the meaning of &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> setting forth the 10-percent total compensation limit) and not &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>). In the proposal, the Bureau explained that it was proposing more extensive clarifications to two comments interpreting &#167; 1026.36(d)(1), comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.A, which clarifies the meaning of &#8220;total compensation&#8221; as used in &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), and comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.C, to clarify the meaning of &#8220;time period&#8221; in &#167; 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>). The Bureau stated in the proposal that these proposed revisions were collectively intended to clarify that, while the time period used to determine both elements of the 10-percent limit ratio is the same: (1) the non-deferred profits-based compensation for the time period is whatever such compensation was earned during that time period, regardless of when it was actually paid; and (2) compensation that is actually paid during the time period, regardless of when it was earned, generally will be included in the amount of total compensation for that time period, but whether the compensation is included ultimately depends on the type of compensation.", 
                        "Of the institutions and individuals who submitted comments on the proposed changes to the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, very few specifically discussed the proposed clarifications and amendments to \u00a7 1026.36(d) and its commentary. One large depository institution first highlighted some of the proposed changes to the \u00a7 1026.36(d) commentary and then stated that it generally agreed with the Bureau's proposed amendments and clarifications. Some consumer groups expressed general disagreement with elements of \u00a7 1026.36(d) adopted by the 2013 Loan Originator Compensation Final Rule, which they believe the proposed revisions would amplify, but did not address any specific issues with the proposal itself.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing the changes to \u00a7 1026.36(d) and the portions of comment 36(d)(1)-3 that interpret \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) as proposed. As it stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes these changes would facilitate compliance."
