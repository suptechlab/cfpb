# API usage

This is documentation for the API behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [Owning-a-home tools](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/).

The tools depend on a data set that is not available publicly, but the code behind the API and some public data are made available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cfpb/owning-a-home-api).

The documentation spells out how information can be requested from the API's three modules.
