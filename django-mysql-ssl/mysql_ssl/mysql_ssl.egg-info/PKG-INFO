Description: # Django MySQL SSL
        
        **Description**:  Backport support for manage.py dbshell when mysql SSL is enabled
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        This application is confirmed to work with Django 1.5. It should also work with Django 1.6-1.7.  This plugin is not necessary for Django 1.8, as the capability is built into the core.
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Install the application and its dependencies
        
        ```
        pip install django-mysql-ssl
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Make sure you have configured your mysql database in the django settings with the appropriate ssl ca.  You may also need 'cert' and 'key', but for most purposes 'ca' should work fine.  This functionality is built into django and has nothing to do with this plugin.
        
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                ...
                'OPTIONS':  {'ssl': {'ca': '<PATH TO CA CERT>'}}
            }
        }
        ```
        
        1. Connect to the db shell using the `dbshell_ssl` command: 
        
        ```shell
        ./manage.py dbshell_ssl
        ```
        
        ## Known issues
        
        None
