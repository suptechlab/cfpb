    <h3>We will value diversity and inclusion</h3>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect the value</strong> of all roles and disciplines</li>
    <li><strong>Recognize how one's own background</strong>, experiences, and values influence interactions with others </li>
    <li><strong>Solicit, consider, and integrate diverse perspectives</strong> and viewpoints including those that challenge the status quo </li>
    <li><strong>Actively build diverse networks</strong> to consistently access varied perspectives </li>
    <li><strong>Speak up</strong> when noticing that others have not been included </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We will treat each other as partners, not adversaries</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Treat each other honestly and civilly</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Listen and learn</strong> – everyone here knows something you do not </li>
    <li><strong>Assume the best intent</strong> – and remember, intent does not equal impact </li>
    <li><strong>Seek to understand and address underlying concerns</strong>, issues and perspectives   </li>
      <ul>
      <li>Ask open-ended questions </li>
      <li>Listen to understand, not wait for your turn to speak </li>
      <li>Look for options that meet needs and make tradeoffs where needed </li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Resolve issues constructively</strong></li>
      <ul>
      <li>Attend meetings where decisions are made </li>
      <li>Speak directly about concerns </li>
      <li>Honor communications and decision-making protocols </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>We will hold ourselves and each other accountable for these norms</h3>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Be the change you wish to see</strong> — do not wait for others to act </li>
    <li><strong>Hold ourselves accountable first</strong> — look to my own contribution first, honestly and with humility </li>
    <li><strong>Expect mistakes as we learn</strong> — treat mistakes as integral to learning   </li>
      <ul>
      <li>Learn from mistakes and move on </li>
      <li>Be compassionate to others as they make mistakes — and ourselves </li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Learn by receiving feedback</strong> with a willingness to be influenced rather than challenge or defend </li>
    <li><strong>Give clear feedback</strong>, within two days when others fall and when they do well:   </li>
      <ul>
      <li>Situation (a specific email, meeting, conversation, event) </li>
      <li>Behavior (what you said, did, wrote, etc.) </li>
      <li>Impact (what it meant, implied, created for others) </li>
      <li>Request (please continue this, start something else, stop doing that) </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
