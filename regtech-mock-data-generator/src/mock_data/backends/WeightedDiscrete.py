"""This class implements a mechanism with which values can be sampled from a finite
set of options with specified frequency. The class is initialized with a dictionary
mapping objects to weights. These weights are non-zero numerical values indicating the
relative frequency with which objects in the set will be sampled.

For example, suppose you wished to sample a day of the week but you wanted Monday to 
be much more common than the other days. You could implement this as follows:

```
weekday_sampler = WeightedDiscrete(
    {
        "Monday": 20, 
        "Tuesday": 1,
        "Wednesday": 1, 
        "Thursday": 1, 
        "Friday": 1, 
        "Saturday": 1, 
        "Sunday": 1
    }
)

sampled_days = weekday_sampler.generate_samples(size=1000)
```

The `sampled_days` array above will contain approximately 20 Mondays per 26 samples.

It is also possible to pass the population argument as a list. The items in the list
are interpreted as the elements within the population. A weight of 1 is automatically
assigned to each element internally.
