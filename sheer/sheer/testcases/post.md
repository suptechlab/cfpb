Welcome to the online home of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
This new bureau is in the construction phase, but we’re already hard at work
on plans to make consumer financial products and services clearer for
Americans—putting in place building blocks that will enable us to improve
disclosures, enforce new consumer protections established by Congress, protect
consumers from deceptive, unfair, and abusive practices, and allow financial
services providers to compete on a level playing field.

Elizabeth Warren announces CFPB is officially open for suggestions.

The consumer bureau will get much of its legal authority in July 2011. We’re
launching this website almost six months in advance for only one reason: to
listen to the American public. Hearing from you today will help us develop our
plans for tomorrow.

Today, we kick off our virtual listening tour with [Open for
Suggestions](/openforsuggestions).

In the coming days, weeks, and months, we’ll provide consumers with many
different opportunities to connect with us. We’ll have regular blog updates,
digital town halls, and many more ways to share thoughts with _your_ new CFPB.

Together, we have an opportunity to create a new consumer bureau that’s
focused on making the market for consumer financial products and services
work. And, we’re hiring! You can learn more by checking out [our Jobs
page](/jobs/).

Finally, this is only the start of the conversation. You can follow us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/cfpb), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/cfpb)
and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/cfpbphotos), and provide an email address
so we can keep you informed of the most important updates about your CFPB.
