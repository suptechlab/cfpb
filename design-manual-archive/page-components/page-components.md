### Our Page components section includes individual UI elements that can be used to design a webpage. These elements are part of CFPBâ€™s [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/), a set of front-end components built by in-house designers and developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as possible.

### Group components, items included here which are actually a group of UI elements, reflect modules that we use within our Content Management System. They are documented here primarily for easy reference by our designers and secondarily as inspiration for anyone creating a system of components.
