### Our Global elements section contains structural elements that can be used to create the foundation of a webpage as well as elements that appear on every page. These elements are part of CFPBâ€™s [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/), a set of front-end components built by in-house designers and developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as possible.

### Page templates reflect common page types that we use within our Content Management System. They are documented here primarily for easy reference by our designers and secondarily as inspiration for anyone creating a system of components.
