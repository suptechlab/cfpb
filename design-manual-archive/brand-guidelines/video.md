Video is a powerful tool that can be used to educate viewers about the financial marketplace and the CFPB's role in regulating it.
{: class="lead-in"}

Video is a complex medium, so it is essential to pay attention to every detail, for example: composition, color treatment, typography and timing. The audience should recognize a CFPB video through its unique visual treatment.
